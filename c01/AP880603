<HEAD>Dukakis At Wife's Side After Surgery; Bush Welcomes Reagan</HEAD>

   Democrat Michael Dukakis spent Friday at his wife's side as she
recovered from a delicate spinal operation. Republican George Bush
welcomed President Reagan home from the superpower summit in
Moscow, saying, ``You made us proud.''
   Going into the final weekend of the 1988 presidential primary
season, only Jesse Jackson was formally campaigning, calling for an
end to discrimination against AIDS victims and greater attention to
environmental issues.
   ``We cannot wait to lead our nation away from discrimination and
fear-mongering. All leaders must speak out now,'' Jackson said in a
statement in Los Angeles. ``The president must take every available
step, including an executive order, to stop discrimination now.''
   Dukakis is favored to best Jackson in Tuesday's balloting in
California, Montana, New Jersey and New Mexico and seal his hold on
the Democratic presidential nomination.
   The Massachusetts governor continued to pick up backing from
delegates formerly uncommitted or pledged to candidates who now
have dropped out. With more than 20 switching to his column Friday,
he was less than 300 delegates short of the 2,081 he needs to win
the nomination in Atlanta in July. Tuesday's primaries have 466
Democratic delegates at stake.
   Dukakis canceled his campaign schedule Thursday to return to
Boston after doctors urged immediate surgery for his wife Kitty. He
spent the night at Massachusetts General Hospital and then worked
at the hospital awaiting the end of the operation.
   After five hours of surgery to correct a neck problem that
doctors feared could lead to paralysis, the prognosis was positive.
   ``The operation went very well,'' said Dr. Lawrence Borges.
``There were no problems at all.''
   Doctors removed two herniated discs from her neck and replaced
them with bone taken from her hip. She had been experiencing pain
and numbness for several weeks and doctors determined both problems
were caused by dangerous pressure on her spine caused by the discs.
   ``I talked to Kitty in the recovery room and she said she wanted
an ice cream and a massage,'' Dukakis said following the surgery.
``I'm prepared to provide both.''
   Dukakis said he would resume campaigning in New Jersey over the
weekend, if Mrs. Dukakis' condition remained good, and head to
California for a final campaign swing on Sunday.
   Bush, the GOP-nominee-to-be, returned to Washington from a week
of meetings at his Kennebunkport, Maine, summer home to be part of
the entourage welcoming President Reagan back from Moscow.
   ``This week, an American president strode the hard ground of Red
Square and reminded the world through the sureness of his step and
the lilting of his words ... what a moving and bracing thing
freedom is,'' Bush said in the ceremonies at Andrews Air Force
Base. ``The fact is, you made us proud.''
   ``On behalf of the people of the United States of America,
welcome home and well done,'' he said.
   Before welcoming Reagan, Bush flew by helicopter to Walter Reed
Army Medical Center to visit Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, who is suffering from stomach and liver cancer.
   ``I plan to wish him well and share our country's appreciation
for all he's done for democracy,'' Bush said before the half-hour
visit.
   Jackson, who was campaigning Friday in California, Montana and
New Mexico, told a gathering in Sante Fe, N.M., that the issue of
nuclear waste storage and toxic dumps ``is no longer a fringe
issue.''
   ``Environmental protection is central to our existence. ... It
goes to the heart of the American dream. I stand to protect that
dream.''
   In Montana, Jackson spoke at a dinner sponsored by the state
Democratic Party in Butte, where he was warmly received by the few
hundred in attendance, most of whom wore Dukakis buttons.
   He offered a prayer for Mrs. Dukakis. Noting that the
Massachusetts governor was home by his wife's side, Jackson joked
that ``he has done such a good job in Massachusetts, I'm trying to
keep him there four more years.''
   With the primaries almost over, Dukakis began to muse a bit
about the process of picking a running mate.
   In an interview aboard his campaign plane heading back to Boston
Thursday evening, he said 1984 Democratic nominee Walter Mondale
advised against following his example of a public series of
interviews with possible running mates. Dukakis said he was taking
that advice to heart.
   ``I doubt very much I will do that,'' he said.
   But asked what kind of process he intended to go through in
choosing a vice presidential running mate, Dukakis said, ``I don't
know. I really don't know.''
   The Massachusetts governor leads Bush in polls, both nationally
and in many states.
   ``Frankly, I think one of the reasons that he's in trouble is
because it's been largely a negative campaign now for four weeks.
And I don't think that's what people are looking for,'' Dukakis
said.

   Ecuador's air force commander, two other
generals and an Israeli military attache were killed Friday night
along with seven other people when their plane hit a mountain near
Quito, officials said.
   The military plane carrying Gen. Angel Augusto Flores, 52, the
air force chief, and Gens. Raul Cousin and Galo Coronel crashed
into the mountain on the outskirts of this highland capital at
about 6 p.m. (7 p.m. EDT).
   Among the dead was Pen Shoa, an Israeli military attache, the
air force said in a communique. It did not give Shoa's rank.
   The communique said all 11 people in the plane were killed and
that all were military.
   Police at the scene said the plane crashed into a mountain three
miles from downtown Quito and tumbled into a small river, with part
of the fuselage falling in the water.
   A spokesman for the Office of the Presidency, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, also confirmed the generals' deaths.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known.

   A woman who runs an upholstery shop says she
scrounged up a posse of friends and relatives to help police nab a
man suspected of burglarizing the family business.
   Angelina Diggs of Pittsburgh recruited friends, neighbors and
``cousins we hadn't seen in years'' to canvass several
neighborhoods hoping to find fences, or dealers in stolen goods.
   ``We stayed up day and night, stopping people on the sidewalks
and asking a boatload of questions,'' she said.
   A tip led to an address where a man showed Mrs. Diggs the love
seat and sofa, worth $2,500, that were stolen Saturday.
   She returned and, posing as a buyer, paid $250 in marked money.
Detectives sprang from a hiding place when they saw the man carry
the furniture to her car.
   Police said they charged Carl Brevard, 24, of Pittsburgh with
receiving stolen property.

<TEXT>
   A Continental Airlines DC-10 pilot aborted
his takeoff at 115 mph when he concluded there was insufficient
clearance between his plane and a Delta Air Lines jet that had
landed in front of him, officials said.
   Four of the jet's tires deflated due to over-heating, but no one
aboard the flight scheduled from Los Angeles International Airport
to Honolulu on Thursday was injured.
   The Continental jet had reached a speed of about 115 mph but
never left the ground, authorities said. It carried 148 passengers
and about 15 crew members, said airline spokesman Ned Walker in
Houston.
   ``The tower had cleared the captain for takeoff,'' Walker said.
``The captain began takeoff roll down the runway when he observed
another jet aircraft at the end of the runway that he felt had not
cleared the runway adequately, and as a precautionary move aborted
the takeoff.''
   FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said the Continental pilot had made
a prudent decision ``based on his perception,'' but the jet ahead
of him was already off the runway.
   ``A Delta aircraft had landed ahead of the Continental aircraft
and had cleared the runway but apparently stopped on the taxiway,''
Ms. Brekke said.
   Passengers got off the Continental jet onto a taxiway but did
not use emergency exits, officials said.
   Four of the DC-10's tires lost air because they have
heat-sensitive safety plugs that allow the tires to deflate at a
certain temperature to prevent blowouts, Ms. Brekke and Walker said.

   Share prices rose moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange on Saturday, lifting the market's main index to a record
high.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 84.94
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 27,906.48 points, a new high,
during Saturday's half-day session.
   The Nikkei's previous high was 27,869.36 points, registered
Thursday.
   The market barometer soared in early morning trading, but
profit-taking lowered the index slightly before the market's close.
   Traders said steel issues, especially Nippon Steel and Kawasaki
Steel, led the gain.
   ``Institutional investors are active today,'' said a broker at a
major securities firm on condition of anonymity. ``Japanese
investors were relieved by bullishness in New York following the
slightly worse-than-expected level of the U.S. unemployment rates.''
   The New York Dow Jones Average gained $18.85 dollars in
overnight trading, ending the largest weekly gain ever, traders
said.
   The volume traded in the first section of the exchange was 1.4
billion shares. Traders said the volume was higher than average for
half-day trading.
   The Tokyo foreign exchange market is closed on Saturday.

<HEAD>President Says Taiwan Will Not Reimpose Martial Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui said today that
Taiwan will not reimpose martial law despite bloody rioting last
month and almost daily demonstrations for more democracy.
   The mass-circulation China Times quoted the president as saying
Taiwan's strong military ``will never interfere with politics.''
   Lee's remarks were made Thursday to a group of ethnic Chinese
professors from Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States
visiting Taiwan for a seminar on the island's political and
economic liberalization.
   The political liberalization, which included ending 38 years of
martial law last July, has led to hundreds of demonstrations. Last
month a protest by farmers turned into a bloody battle between riot
police and demonstrators that reportedly left more than 200 people
injured.
   A group of 75 conservative Nationalist legislators called for a
return to martial law in response to the rioting.
   ``To again declare martial law will be out of the question,''
Lee was quoted as saying.
   Lee also appeared anxious to scotch newspaper reports that the
government has had little control over the military since the death
in January of long-time leader President Chiang Ching-kuo, who was
the main architect of Taiwan's recent liberalization trend.
   ``In some countries, soldiers chased the president away with
their carbines, but this will never occur here,'' Lee was quoted as
saying.

   A 120-acre slice of London _ filled with railroad
yards, scruffy shops and low-quality apartment blocks _ will be
redeveloped in what one organization calls the largest inner-city
regeneration project in Europe.
   Britain's state-owned railroad on Thursday said $11 billion
would be spent to develop the huge and largely derelict area around
King's Cross and St. Pancras train stations.
   British Rail called it the largest urban redevelopment project
in Europe.
   The redevelopment of the site by the specially formed London
Regeneration Consortium will begin in 1990 and last 10 years,
British Rail said.
   The area will be developed to provide new offices, homes, shops,
business premises and leisure facilities.
   British Rail said the two stations will be merged and a new
subway station built to form the world's largest railroad station.

<TEXT>
   A federal magistrate refused Friday to
release on bond two New York women charged with conspiracy for
their alleged roles in a Panama-to-New York cocaine pipeline.
   In denying bond for the defendants, U.S. Magistrate Claude Hicks
said the government had presented convincing testimony to show that
the two might fail to return for trial.
   Regina Smith, 27, and Julia Thom, 35, were arrested on May 27 at
a Moultrie motel during a meeting with Jackie Lee Bigelow, 27, a
former soldier who was stationed in Panama.
   Bigelow has been linked by officials of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration to a drug-smuggling ring that allegedly
operated through American military bases in Panama.
   Mrs. Smith is a citizen of Panama and Ms. Thom is a U.S.
citizen. Authorities said neither has ever been arrested previously.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Fowler argued that the two
should not be released because the United States has no extradition
treaty with Panama.
   She also noted that both defendants are unemployed, face
substantial penalties if convicted on the drug charges and have no
ties to south Georgia.
   Three other women who allegedly assisted Bigelow were released
on $50,000 bond each.
   As they left the federal courthouse in Albany, Brenda McGee, 25,
Betty Howard, 31, and Maxine Williams, 24, were greeted by friends
and relatives. All three are from nearby Colquitt County.
   Bigelow was arrested on May 24 after he was stopped in Colquitt
County for a minor traffic offense and admitted he was carrying an
18-pound package of cocaine. Another 29-pound package was seized
Friday at the Moultrie post office.
   FBI agent Jim Grady of Thomasville said investigators monitored
about a dozen phone conversations between Mrs. Smith's husband,
Oscar, and Bigelow after he agreed to cooperate with authorities.
During one of the calls, Smith said he was sending two women,
including his wife, to pick up the drugs and return them to New
York, said Grady.

   Will the best musical be a big British
blockbuster based on a variation of ``Beauty and the Beast,'' or a
dark fairy tale where happily ever after never comes?
   Will the best play be a savage comedy about two movie moguls in
the making, or a haunting tale about the children of slaves coming
to terms with the past or a bizarre love story involving a French
diplomat and a Chinese opera singer of indeterminate sex?
   The competition for the 1988 Tony Awards reflects the fact that
artistically this was Broadway's best season in several years. And
more importantly for the New York theater industry, all the shows
nominated for best play and best musical are still running.
   The awards show, to be televised Sunday, June 5 at 9 pm. EDT on
CBS, should be a giant advertisement for Broadway.
   There are a number of strong candidates in almost every
category, particularly musical, with ``The Phantom of the Opera,''
``Into the Woods'' and a revival of Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes''
each getting 10 nominations.
   The battle between ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' the English
extravaganza by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and ``Into the Woods,'' an
American challenger written by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine,
holds the most interest.
   The best play competition is also spirited. The nominees are
``M. Butterfly'' by David Henry Hwang, ``Speed-the-Plow'' by David
Mamet, ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' by August Wilson and ``A Walk
in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing.
   More than any other theater award, the Tony has always helped a
show where it counts _ at the box office. ``Joe Turner'' and ``A
Walk in the Woods'' are doing marginal business and will need the
prize to survive the summer. Only ``Speed-the-Plow'' has done
exceptional business and much of that has been because of one of
its co-stars, pop singer Madonna.
   ``Into the Woods'' already has picked up best musical awards
from the New York Drama Critics Circle and the Drama Desk, two
other theater organizations. But don't count ``Phantom'' out. It is
the biggest success of the season, at least in financial terms, and
Tony voters usually go for the money. The other shows up for best
musical are ``Sarafina!,'' a South African musical, and ``Romance
Romance,'' a small evening of two one-act musicals.
   If any award would appear to be a shoo-in, the prize for best
actor in a musical would seem to be locked up by Michael Crawford
who plays the title role in ``The Phantom of the Opera.'' Even
critics who panned the musical had high praise for Crawford's
portrayal of the deformed composer who lurks in the shadows of the
Paris Opera House. His competitors include Scott Bakula, ``Romance
Romance''; David Carroll of ``Chess''; and Howard McGillin,
``Anything Goes.''
   Patti LuPone, McGillin's co-star in ``Anything Goes,'' is the
favorite for the best actress in a musical award. Her biggest
competition is Joanna Gleason who plays the baker's wife in ``Into
the Woods.'' The other nominees are Alison Fraser of ``Romance
Romance'' and Judy Kuhn of ``Chess.''
   The best actor category is the most competitive in several
seasons. The category was so crowded that several promising
candidates didn't even get nominated including John Malkovich who
gave a bravura performance in Lanford Wilson's ``Burn This.''
   The choices are Ron Silver, one of those would-be film producers
in ``Speed-the-Plow''; John Lithgow, the bewildered diplomat in
``M. Butterfly''; Derek Jacobi, a tortured mathematical genius in
``Breaking the Code''; and Robert Prosky, a Soviet arms negotiator
in ``A Walk in the Woods.''
   There weren't many good roles for women on Broadway this season.
Joan Allen should win the best actress award for her portrait of a
ballet dancer in ``Burn This.'' Others nominated are Glenda
Jackson, ``Macbeth''; Blythe Danner, ``A Streetcar Named Desire'';
and Frances McDormand, ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
   ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' dominates the featured actress
category. Three of its performers _ Kimberleigh Aarn, L. Scott
Caldwell and Kimberly Scott _ were nominated in that category.
Their competition is Kate Nelligan, who appeared in the short-lived
British satire, ``Serious Money.'' The winner is a toss-up.
   B.D. Wong as the exotic opera singer in ``M. Butterfly'' is the
favorite to take the featured actor award. He goes against Michael
Gough, ``Breaking the code''; Lou Liberatore, ``Burn This''; and
Delroy Lindo, ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone.''
   ``Phantom'' is expected to dominate the technical awards for
sets, costumes and lighting. If it does, Maria Bjornson could walk
off with two Tonys, one for scenery and the other for costumes for
the lavish musical.
   Don Mischer, executive producer of the Tony Awards television
show, has vowed to keep it at two hours in length. The program will
feature scenes from all the productions nominated for best play and
best musical. It will also include a musical and dance tribute to
director and choreographer Michael Bennett who died last July.

   A severe storm system that stretched from Kansas deep into Texas
riddled the Great Plains with heavy rain and hail Thursday. A
separate storm system brought rain to the Tennessee and Ohio
valleys and southwest Virginia.
   In central Texas, a severe thunderstorm in Abilene smashed
windows and windshields with baseball-size hail, knocking down
power lines and uprooting trees. No injuries were reported,
authorities said.
   Wind gusts of up to 70 mph blew down utility poles and
overturned mobile homes in China Spring, in the central part of the
state. Gusts of 70 mph and marble-size hail were recorded near
Temple.
   Dallas got 1.70 inches and Waco got 1.50 inches of rain in a
six-hour period ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   In Oklahoma, a tornado touched down near Marland, in the
northeast part of the state. Nickel-size hail fell near Hugo, in
southeastern Oklahoma. In Kansas, winds of up to 60 mph blew
through Sedan and pea-size hail fell in Ellinwood.
   Tornado watches were issued through the evening for parts of
western and north-central Texas, with severe thunderstorm watches
over much of Oklahoma, western and central Arkansas and southwest
Missouri.
   Farther east, a cold front stretching from North Carolina across
southern West Virginia and central Indiana to eastern Minnesota
sent the mercury plummeting. Terre Haute, Ind., untouched by the
front, sizzled at 91 degrees at 2 p.m. EDT; Fort Wayne, Ind., 200
miles north, had a reading of 56 at the same hour.
   Unseasonably cool weather predominated in the northern and
Middle Atlantic Coast states. A few showers were scattered over
Florida's southeast coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 47
degrees at Wenatchee, Wash., to 104 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
The morning low for the nation was 28 degrees at Chama, N.M.
   Friday's forecast called for thunderstorms over much of the
Southeast from the Carolinas and Georgia across the Tennessee and
lower Mississippi valleys to eastern parts of Oklahoma and Texas,
with more showers over the Middle Atlantic States, western
Pennsylvania, New York and northern Maine. Rain was also forecast
for eastern Minnesota, Iowa and southeast Nebraska, parts of the
interior Northwest and coastal sections from Washington to northern
California.
   High temperatures should remain in the 50s over parts of
northern New England and into the 60s from the northern and Middle
Atlantic Coast to the Great Lakes, and along the northern Pacific
Coast; in the low 90s in eastern Montana and parts of southern
Georgia and northern Florida, southwest Texas and parts of New
Mexico. Highs should range in the 70s and 80s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Of Bribes And Men _ The Restaurant Rat List</HEAD>

   Just two weeks after the FBI charged 28 health
inspectors with extortion for threatening to add restaurants to the
city's notorious Rat List, several restaurateurs showed two can
play that game by trying to bribe their way off the list.
   About one-third of the city's health inspectors were indicted;
the FBI and the city's Department of Investigations found at least
300 of the city's 15,000 or so restaurants were solicited for
bribes just during its investigation.
   ``Some restaurant owners dreaded to see them coming, driving up
in Cadillacs and wearing Rolex watches,'' said James M. Fox, head
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the city.
   The Health Department was still stinging from the scandal when
some restaurateurs assumed the cozy hand-in-pocket relationship had
been only briefly suspended.
   ``Two weeks after all the notoriety about the inspection
scandals, six of our inspectors reported that restaurant managers
and owners tried to bribe them,'' said Marvin Bogner, the city's
assistant health commissioner.
   Noting that inspectors usually take off their suit coats and don
blue work jackets for inspections, Bogner said: ``One inspector
noticed the restaurateur putting a wad of bills in his coat pocket.
   ``The inspector took the wad of bills and threw it on the
kitchen floor.''
   The bribe attempts, offered in late April, involved ``a wide
spectrum of restaurants'' ranging from beaneries to bistros, said
Bogner. He would not name any because the Department of
Investigations is looking into the reports.
   The most obvious public effect of the crackdown by the FBI and
the city has been that newspapers stopped publishing the city
Health Department's Rat List, officially and more politely called
the list of ``Food Inspection Results.''
   The newspapers said they could not be sure if a restaurant had a
legitimate sanitation problem or if the owner had merely resisted
extortion by health inspectors.
   New York gourmets and gourmands had scanned The New York Times,
Newsday and the Daily News weekly with mingled horror and
fascination, fearing that their favorite eatery would be listed
after they enjoyed a meal there.
   A few typical examples:
   _ A restaurant that, among other violations, had ``mouse
droppings, flies, (and an) employee smoking while serving.''
   _ A bakery cited for having ``nail-polish remover, motorcycle
oil, peroxide, paints, cough medicines and insecticides on shelves
near food.''
   _ Greenwich Street's Pussycat Lounge, for _ of course _ ``cats
kept on premises.'' Perhaps it is not a coincidence that the
restaurants cited for having cats had no rodent droppings, and vice
versa.
   _ A few ``power lunch'' spots, where the city's movers and
shakers talk big business, have also received violation notices.
   In 1982, Mimi Sheraton, then the Times' restaurant reviewer,
raved about the ``satiny'' vinaigrette dressing and ``bracing''
golden consomme at La Cote Basque, giving it a three-star rating.
   The Health Department panned La Cote Basque in 1984, citing its
``slime-laden'' ice cream machine and ``greasy'' floor. At the
time, the prix fixe luncheon cost $25.
   The Rat List wasn't always so specific. Until last autumn, it
just named offending restaurants without citing whether they had
cats, rats or were simply missing necessary operating permits.
   A New York Times spokeswoman said editors decided to change the
format of the weekly list to help readers distinguish between major
and minor health violations.
   The satirical monthly magazine ``Spy'' beat all the dailies by a
year by providing the real dirt on the city's restaurants beginning
in October 1986, said Joe Mastriani, the editor in charge of the
column.
   ``It was a pretty popular feature,'' he added, but ``Spy''
dropped it last fall when the newspapers began running the new,
comprehensive Rat List.
   The new full-disclosure policy ended in late March when the FBI
charged that the 28 current and former Health Department inspectors
had doubled and tripled their annual salaries of $25,000 to $30,000
through extortion.

   Sheila Shea was just trying for a last
laugh, but some officials say the cemetery that's the final resting
place of Louisa May Alcott is no place for a tombstone that reads:
``Who The Hell Is Sheila Shea.''
   Shea, who died a year and a half ago at age 43, is buried in the
historic Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, in whose ``Authors' Row'' are
buried Alcott and 19th-century luminaries Ralph Waldo Emerson and
Henry David Thoreau.
   The disagreement over the 3{-foot, gray granite headstone
recently surfaced at the Concord Cemetery Committee, which labeled
the inscription ``obscene.'' Some members of the committee, an
advisory body to the town's department of public works, pushed for
legal action to have the headstone removed.
   ``The cemetery really isn't a place to make a statement, it is a
place of memorial,'' Committee President Mary Elizabeth Baker said.
``Sleepy Hollow is a notable cemetery because of the people who are
buried there. It has a national reputation. We would hate to see it
become a sideshow.''
   Officials decided that the town could not afford a legal battle
and that it would be fighting from shaky legal ground, said Tony
Logalbo, town finance director. But they have changed the rules to
guard against similar headstones at the widely visited cemetery.
   ``It's a tourist site. People who are visiting the town of
Concord go to find the grave sites of well-known individuals from
history,'' Logalbo said Thursday. ``Some people in the town felt
that the sentiments it expresses were not in keeping with the
spirit of the site.''
   Town officials were divided over whether the word ``hell'' is
obscene.
   Concord, an affluent town 19 miles northwest of Boston, was
founded by the Puritans in 1635. It was the site of the second
Revolutionary War clash, the home of several well-known early
American authors, and site of Thoreau's celebrated Walden Pond.
   Shea, who is remembered by her friends as a warm, fun-loving
person, died in November 1986 of cancer. She had worked in the
accounting department of a Cambridge company, and had arranged and
paid for her friends to have dinner after her funeral.
   She was divorced and left a teen-age son and daughter.
   Norma Wentworth, a nurse who helped administer her chemotherapy
treatments, said she imagined Shea would be laughing at the
brouhaha over her headstone.
   ``She just had a very good sense of humor,'' Wentworth said.
``She did not intend to be malicious.''
   As a result of the debate over the headstone, anyone who wishes
to buy a plot at Sleepy Hollow in the future will be informed of
restrictions against ``improper or offensive'' headstones,
according to a recent measure approved by the town board of
selectmen.
   The measure would allow the cemetery committee to remove future
headstones, but the list of restrictions does not include any
specific words or phrases.
   Nancy Griffin, the executor of Shea's will, had contacted the
American Civil Liberties Union and vowed to fight any attempt to
remove her friend's headstone.
   ``No matter what Sheila's reasons were, a person has a right to
freedom of speech, dead or alive,'' Griffin said.

<HEAD>Bill To Protect Elderly Clears House, Heads For Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A health insurance bill intended to protect
more than 30 million elderly Americans from the financial ravages
of serious illness is one short step away from final congressional
approval.
   ``It's a landmark accomplishment and it's going to remove an
awful lot of fear from the minds of over 30 million seniors,'' Rep.
Pete Stark, D-Calif., said after the House voted 328-72 Thursday to
approve a catastrophic health insurance bill.
   The measure goes to the Senate where similarly overwhelming
approval is assured, probably next week. It represents the biggest
expansion of Medicare in the program's 23-year history.
   Originally proposed by President Reagan more than a year ago _
albeit in a less expansive version _ the legislation is intended to
protect the nation's 32 million Medicare beneficiaries from
financial ruin stemming from illnesses that run up big hospital and
doctor bills.
   ``The legislation will go a long way to alleviate the fears that
elderly people have about being wiped out from financial costs when
catastrophic illness hits,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who
with Stark was a major mover in the project.
   Waxman acknowledged that the measure does not address the
problem of nursing home and other long-term costs for people not
sick enough to be hospitalized, but unable to live alone.
   ``That has to be No. 1 on our agenda for the next breakthrough
in the health area,'' said Waxman.
   Although the final House-Senate version was considerably
enriched along the way _ mainly by the addition of an outpatient
prescription drug benefit _ Health and Human Services Secretary
Otis R. Bowen has said he will ask President Reagan to sign the
measure, which House Speaker Jim Wright has called ``the most
important health initiative in recent years.''
   The bill provides full hospital coverage after a once-a-year
deductible estimated at $564 in 1989 and indexed to hospital
inflation. Medicare now pays full charges for no more than 59 days
a year and the recipient is subject to a deductible for each
hospitalization.
   The cap on costs for physicians is $1,370 a year. After a $75
deductible, Medicare now pays 80 percent of approved doctor bills
and that part of the program remains intact. Starting in 1989,
however, the $75 deductible and the 20 percent share paid by
beneficiaries count toward the $1,370 cap. After that is reached,
Medicare pays 100 percent of approved doctor bills.
   However, the beneficiary will remain liable for any portion of
doctor bills that exceed the fees approved by Medicare.
   In a new benefit, Medicare will pay half of outpatient
prescription drug costs in 1991 after a $600 deductible is met. The
government share rises to 60 percent in 1992 and 80 percent in
1993. However, the deductible is expected to rise each year to keep
pace with rising drug costs.
   Medicare now does not cover outpatient drugs except for a
handful of very expensive ones such as anti-rejection medication
for organ transplant recipients.
   All the additional benefits are to be paid for by additional
charges to Medicare enrollees _ a combination of flat monthly
premium increases deducted from Social Security checks and an
additional, sliding-scale supplemental premium that will be charged
to the estimated 40 percent of the elderly with enough income to
make them subject to federal income taxes.
   The additional flat premium starts at $4 a month in 1989,
climbing to $10.20 in 1993.
   The so-called supplemental premium _ in essence an income tax
surcharge _ starts at $22.50 a year for each $150 of income tax
owed in 1989, climbing to an additional $42 a year on each $150 of
tax liability by 1993. There is an $800 cap on the supplemental
premium in 1989, climbing to $1,050 in 1993.

   Here are the major recommendations issued by
retired Navy. Adm. James D. Watkins, chairman of the White House
AIDS commission.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   States should begin to require reporting of HIV-positive
antibody tests and should pass this information on to the Centers
for Disease Control, without patient names.
   Terminology must be selected and used carefully to make the
public more aware of the entire spectrum of HIV infection, from
initial infection to seroconversion to full-blown AIDS.
   Extensive research should be conducted and results widely
disseminated to provide more accurate information on the spread of
HIV into the heterosexual population.
   Additional data on the progression rates from infection to
disease to death are necessary.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PATIENT CARE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Physicians should begin to more frequently utilize the HIV
antibody test as a diagnostic tool, and incorporate the test and
counseling into the normal range of services offered to patients.
   Funds should be made directly available to community-based
organizations serving the needs of home-bound persons with AIDS,
especially in the area of nutrition, psychosocial and direct care
support.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Health care profession schools should be given incentives to
recruit medical students into specialties that are underrepresented
but needed due to the HIV epidemic.
   The Department of Labor should move expeditiously, within one
year, to develop a permanent and enforceable standard covering
blood-borne diseases, with penalties for noncompliance, to protect
health care and other workers whose jobs involve exposure to blood
and blood-contaminated bodily fluids.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RESEARCH, FDA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Make the development of appropriate animal models for
HIV-related research an immediate and high priority.
   Establish a federally supported computerized network of all
HIV-related research activities to promote greater exchange of
information and data between researchers.
   All approaches to vaccine development should continue to be
explored and developed until one or more are successful.
   Standards for condom safety should be increased and studies
should be conducted to determine the effects of spermicides,
solvents and other lubricants on latex. Studies to determine the
shelf life of latex condoms, with or without lubricants or
spermicides, should be performed, and packaging dated accordingly.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PREVENTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   States should adopt strong statutes that protect the
confidentiality of a person's test results and that protect a
person from discriminatory retaliation.
   All state and local health agencies should be adequately funded
to develop HIV partner notification programs without diverting
resources from other sexually transmitted disease partner
notification programs.
   Quarantine or isolation of HIV-infected individuals based only
on HIV status without consideration of an individual's behavior is
not appropriate and should not be adopted by any state.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Centers for Disease Control should conduct a 90-day study on the
effectiveness of purchasing paid advertising, in addition to
requesting advertising at no cost, to prevent misinformation about
the HIV epidemic going to the general public.
   State boards of education should mandate that an AIDS education
curriculum with appropriate content for age be offered to all
students at each schooling level (e.g., elementary, middle and high
school) throughout the state.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIETAL ISSUES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse, in conjunction with state
agencies, local drug abuse officials and representatives of drug
treatment providers, should develop a plan for increasing the
capacity of the drug treatment system so that the goal of
treatment-on-demand can be met.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE WORKPLACE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Public and private employers should ensure that their workplace
policies provide HIV-infected employees with the same rights and
benefits offered other employees with other illnesses and
disabilities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LEGAL AND ETHICAL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Comprehensive federal anti-discrimination legislation which
prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in the
public and private sectors, including employment, housing, public
accommodations and participation in government programs, should be
enacted.
   Each school system should establish a board-developed policy,
with accompanying guidelines, for dealing with an individual with
HIV infection in the school before it is confronted with the first
case.
   The commission recommends ... adoption of federal legislation
that mandates that identifying information obtained by any
provider, laboratory, payor or agency through HIV testing and
counseling cannot be disclosed without the written consent of the
individual (except under certain specific circumstances.)
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE FUTURE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Congress should enact legislation which expands the Public
Health Emergencies provision of the Public Health Services Act to
enhance the authority of the surgeon general when the president
determines and declares public health emergencies in the nation.
   The surgeon general should sit as the principal spokesperson on
the president's cabinet whenever issues related to the public
health emergency are discussed.
   The surgeon general's office should be established as an
independent entity within the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   The surgeon general should construct the administration's budget
requests for the public health emergency in consultation with the
heads of all affected agencies and without clearance of the Office
of Management and Budget before submission to the president.

<DATELINE>YAROSLAVL, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The day President Reagan left the
Soviet Union, Yuri Osipov also took a trip. The railway worker rode
the 7:15 a.m. train to Moscow to get a sofa, because he said there
was nothing worth buying in Yaroslavl.
   In state food stores, another day began with no meat on sale.
   In Yaroslavl's center, the pipes that supply hot water to
apartment houses and shops had been turned off for days, reportedly
so the mains could be repaired. Foreign tourists at the Hotel
Yaroslavl took icy showers, or none at all.
   A food store in the Dzerzhinsky neighborhood had only one fresh
vegetable for sale _ cucumbers at $1.30 a pound. When a downtown
kiosk on Freedom Street began selling vanilla ice cream, a line of
hundreds of people formed within 10 minutes.
   ``We have nothing here, no meat, not even sausage,'' said
Alexander Dusman, a violinist with the city's symphony orchestra.
   During the summit meeting between Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, some Moscow stores sold Danish hams and other
delicacies that are usually unavailable, and thousands of workers
were dragooned into performing a crash urban facelift.
   That was the stage, but Yaroslavl lay far behind the scenes. In
this ancient Russian city 160 miles northeast of the Soviet
capital, Gorbachev's campaign for more consumer abundance has borne
meager fruit to date.
   ``In the past three years, there have been no changes in the way
people live,'' said a government worker in this city of 600,000
people situated on the upper reaches of the Volga River. ``The only
real accomplishments I see are in foreign policy, and the way the
Soviet Union is perceived abroad.''
   When celebrated poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko in a recent article
wanted to name a city where the food situation was a nightmare, he
picked Yaroslavl.
   Local librarian A. Malygina wrote in a leter published in the
Pravda newspaper Friday that she was ashamed to hear what Soviets
from other cities call her hometown _ ``Yaroslavl the suffering''
or ``the hungry.''
   The scanty variety of food is so critical that every Friday,
buses with license plates marked ``YA'' for Yaroslavl arrive in
northern Moscow, where passengers fan out to state food stores to
load up on sausage, butter, macaroni and other foodstuffs.
   Founded around the year 1010, Yaroslavl may not be typical of
cities in the country's richer agricultural regions, but it
graphically shows how much of the Soviet Union has problems feeding
itself and assuring a better life for its residents.
   Osipov, a broad-shouldered, mustachioed Siberian who moved to
Yaroslavl for its milder climate, has been waiting for two years to
buy a car, but supplies are insufficient.
   He has had his name for four years on a waiting list to obtain a
bigger apartment for himself, his wife and two children, but has no
notion of when he may get one.
   Only 5 percent of the Yaroslavl region's active population works
in agriculture. The fickle climate wipes out at least one harvest
every three years, according to agricultural editors on the local
newspaper, Severny Rabochy (Northern Worker).
   ``Our region was in a disastrous state last year because of a
cold winter and wet, short summer,'' the local Communist Party
chief, Igor A. Tolstoukhov, said in an interview. ``We
unquestionably need to produce more meat, more milk.''
   The 49-year-old party boss is the top authority in a region with
1.4 million people that covers an area the size of the Netherlands.
He said he thought Yevtushenko had exaggerated.
   ``Our people have a healthy, balanced diet,'' he said.
   The lack of locally grown vegetables lures enterprising farmers
to Yaroslavl from as far away as the southern republic of Georgia
and the city of Grozny near the Caspian Sea.
   They fly northward with boxes of tomatoes to sell in stalls at
Yaroslavl's open air market. The price: $4.50 a pound. Women from
the western Ukraine sell baked sunflower and pumpkin seeds.
   Yaroslavl, which is studded with ancient onion-domed churches,
is an important industrial center that produces tires,
petrochemicals and diesel engines.
   Leonid A. Chesnokov, editor in chief of Severny Rabochy, said
complaints had been mounting recently about the quality of the
diesel engines produced. In December, workers at the plant staged a
demonstration to protest ``black Saturdays'' _ days where they were
called in to work to make up for lags in output.
   Chesnokov said the paper receives about 30,000 letters a year
from readers who want to see ``major economic problems solved'' and
greater efficiency and productivity in the workplace.
   However, the newspaper itself showed some of the problems that
the local press is having in adapting to the new conditions of
Gorbachev's ``glasnost'' campaign.
   On Tuesday, Severny Rabochy printed on its front page a
two-day-old Tass dispatch sbout Reagan's arrival in Moscow on
Sunday. Another page one story announced the ratification of the
intermediate-range missile treaty, four days after the fact.

   When the school cafeteria ran
out of pizza, milk and other items, 12-year-old Philip Costanzo
didn't bother complaining to the cook. He sent around a petition
and fired off letters to the media.
   Costanzo, a student at Jacksonville Beach Sixth Grade Center,
drew up a petition in January complaining that items on the menu
were not available to all students. He said he collected 600
signatures in two days among the school's 675 students.
   ``I was swamped with people wanting to sign it,'' he said.
   The youngster gave the petition to Principal Gail Brinson. He
said things improved for a while, but problems cropped up again.
   Philip doesn't eat lunch until 1:30 p.m., the next-to-last meal
shift. By that time, the cafeteria often runs out of the more
popular items. Worst of all, at one point students were given ham
and cheese sandwiches instead of the advertised pizza.
   This time, he fired off letters to the media.
   ``My classmates and I are sick of it! We hope that they pay
attention to this letter,'' he wrote.
   His letter got results when it was shown to school food
officials.
   ``In the future, every effort will be made to have all choices
available to all students at the school during the serving
period,'' said Catherine Bajalia, food services director for the
Duval County Schools.
   School officials blamed the problems on equipment malfunctions
and bad estimates of how many children would eat the school lunch
instead of food they bring from home.

   It's a good time ... for the great taste
of ... garlic?
   That slogan may not yet be McDonald's latest ditty, but if some
garlic farmers get their way, the hamburger chain could someday be
singing the praises of the onion's more pungent relative.
   Organizers of Gilroy's annual Garlic Festival have persuaded the
owner of two local McDonald's to place packages of crushed garlic
alongside the usual condiments during the three-day festival, July
29-31.
   ``We're excited about it,'' said spokeswoman Darlene Dunham of
garlic-growing Christopher Ranch, which will package the 7-gram
servings.
   Tom Doran, McDonald's regional vice president, gave his blessing
to the garlic promotion.
   ``We encourage our franchises to be good neighbors,'' he said.
   But Doran emphasized that no plans were in the works to provide
garlic in any other McDonald's outlets.
   Dunham said her company hopes that the demand for garlic will be
so overwhelming that the huge chain will consider it for nationwide
distribution.

   When Terry Lee Griffith and Kathleen
Boutin get married Saturday, the best man naturally will be decked
out in tails _ three of them.
   The wedding is set to take place in the walking ring of the
Delaware Park horse track in Stanton where the best man, a horse
named The Maltese Cat, will be wearing a black-tie outfit.
   ``I guess you could call this fun _ my having The Maltese Cat be
my best man,'' Griffith said of one of the 16 horses he trains.
   But Griffith, 44, is serious about his choice of best man.
   ``The Cat has brought me through some rough times,'' he said.
   The Maltese Cat, one of four horses Griffith purchased for
$1,250 two years ago, has earned more than $40,000 for Griffith,
who said he faced bankruptcy in 1983.
   The wedding will take place in front of 300 friends and
relatives, including David Malatesta of Hockessin, ``who will stand
as my `human best friend,' my interpreter for The Cat,'' Griffith
said.

<HEAD>Europeans Praise Reagan, Gorbachev For Improving Ties</HEAD>

   The European NATO allies have widely
praised both the U.S. and Soviet leaders for using the Moscow
summit to forge a ``new stability'' in East-West relations.
   ``Respect, growing trust and affection are there'' between
President Reagan and Kremlin chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev after four
days of meetings, said Lord Carrington, the NATO secretary general.
   ``This personal bond, we all hope, augurs well for further
reductions of tension in the international atmosphere,'' he said in
a speech Thursday to the Royal Institute of International Relations
in Brussels.
   ``Things are moving in a good direction,'' said French President
Francois Mitterrand, speaking in Evian, France, after a meeting
with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who also praised the
summit outcome.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, said
the importance of the Moscow meeting _ the fourth for Reagan and
Gorbachev in 30 months _ went beyond the arms issues it dealt with.
   ``Through this summit the American-Soviet relationship got a new
stability, a new perspective,'' Genscher said in Brussels after he
and other alliance officials met with Secretary of State George P.
Shultz at NATO headquarters to hear details of the Moscow talks.
   Shultz gave an upbeat assessment of the summit and told
reporters afterward that the superpowers had come a long way in
their relationship since Reagan first met Gorbachev in Geneva in
November 1985.
   ``It is an undeniable and observable fact that the relationship
now is far better than it was at the time of the first summit,'' he
said.
   The Moscow summit produced no major arms agreements although two
secondary accords were signed, including one requiring at least 24
hours' advance notification before ballistic missile tests.
   The European allies are eager for Washington and Moscow to
conclude an agreement cutting their long-range nuclear missiles by
up to 50 percent. But they showed no outward sign of disappointment
that Shultz reported only modest progress in this area.
   Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister, said the summit
had provided ``a great measure of continuity and consistency'' in
East-West relations. This, he said, made it possible for the
superpowers to work gradually toward more disarmament.
   ``This is not a process of quick fixes, but at least there is a
process,'' he said.
   European officials who heard Shultz's report on the Moscow
meetings said afterward they were not discouraged by the apparently
slim chances completing a new arms reduction agreement before
Reagan leaves office next January.
   ``The firm will expressed in Moscow by both sides on (arms
control) ... is an essential condition for decisive progress in
Geneva,'' Giulio Andreotti, the Italian foreign minister, told
reporters.
   Carrington stressed that Gorbachev deserves much of the credit
for recent improvements in U.S.-Soviet relations, particularly for
the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty that the U.S. and
Soviet leaders put into force on Wednesday. The treaty is the first
to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons.
   ``I don't think it would have happened without him,'' Carrington
said in an interview with The Associated Press at his NATO office.
   He added that Reagan and the NATO alliance did their part by
sticking to a ``twin-track'' strategy of deploying U.S. cruise and
Pershing II nuclear missiles in Europe while also seeking to
negotiate cuts.
   Carrington also indicated that he saw little chance of Reagan
and Gorbachev holding a fifth summit, since both sides have planed
down the odds of completing agreement soon in the Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks.
   ``There would only be a fifth summit if it was possible there
were going to be a START agreement,'' he said. ``I would have
thought it doubtful there would be one otherwise.''
   Genscher said that despite the long odds of a START deal being
completed this year, the Moscow summit offered new hope in all
areas of arms control.
   ``It seems important to us that both sides want to use the next
months to come to agreements,'' he said.

governor of Maine was capped with four years' service as a U.S.
ambassador, died Thursday at age 85.
   Hildreth practiced law in Portland and began his Hildreth
Network of Maine radio and TV stations before he went into
politics. The Hildreth Network included the state's first
commercial radio station, Bangor's WABI.
   In 1940 he was elected to the Maine House and later that same
year he won promotion to the state Senate, where he became
president in 1943. He was elected governor in 1945.
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Hildreth in 1953 as
ambassador to Pakistan, the Moslem country carved out of India in
1947. At that time, Hildreth had been president of Bucknell
University four years.

   Raj Kapoor, a actor known as ``the
Charlie Chaplin of India'' for his comedy roles and who was given
India's highest movie honor, the Dada Saheb Phalke Award, died
Thursday. He was 64.
   Kapoor acted in 60 films and produced or directed 18 others over
a career that spanned four decades. Almost all his movies were hits
in India, and he was perhaps the most popular Indian film actor
abroad with followers in the Soviet Union, the Middle East and
China.
   Among his best-known films was ``Awara'' (The Vagabond), in
which he borrowed from Chaplin and played the part with trousers
riding high above his ankles and a perpetual forlorn look on his
face.

<HEAD>Skier Tells of Hardship, Loneliness on Historic Polar Crossing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Canadian-Soviet ski expedition across the
Arctic ice cap battled high winds, rough terrain and frostbite to
complete a 1,200-mile trek from Siberia to the northern edge of
Canada.
   ``We spent two-thirds of the time skiing and one-third
clambering over ice and boulders. We constantly had to cross open
water because of cracks in the ice,'' Max Buxton said Thursday
after the 13-man team returned to Ottawa to a hero's welcome.
   ``At times, people came pretty close to tumbling in,'' said the
32-year-old family doctor from Ontario, who read about the
Soviet-proposed expedition in a magazine and volunteered.
   Ice ridges in the Arctic reached 100 feet high, he said, and
swirling snowstorms with winds up to 44 miles per hour slowed the
trek.
   Canadian Energy Minister Marcel Masse and Soviet Ambassador
Alexei Rodionov joined about 200 friends, family, flag-waving
schoolchildren and a police band who greeted the parka-clad team at
Ottawa airport on Thursday.
   It took the four Canadians and nine Soviets 91 days to ski about
1,075 miles from the northernmost tip of the Soviet Union to
Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic, where they left the
shifting ice pack on Wednesday.
   They became the first explorers to make a polar crossing from
the Soviet Union to Canada, and they did it entirely by skiing and
climbing over snow and ice without dogsleds or vehicles.
   ``I'm enjoying the warmth,'' said Buxton, who lost the tip of
one toe to frostbite and suffered from exposure but emerged
otherwise unscathed.
   ``Every night I would take off my shoes and look at my mangled
feet and say, `God, I can't go on,''' he said.
   Buxton says the low point came on the first half of the trek,
from Siberia to the North Pole, when temperatures dropped to 48
below zero.
   ``I froze my toes, I had some bad heel blisters and a whole pile
of things wrong. I thought if anybody's not going to make it, I
might be the guy,'' he said.
   ``Considering that 13 men traveled almost 2,000 kilometers
(1,200 miles) as the crow flies and many more thousand kilometers
(miles) twisting and turning, we came off pretty scott-free,'' he
said, citing assorted infections, pulled muscles, tendonitis, frost
and sun damage, but no serious injuries.
   Hardships were many. ``We only had a sponge bath every 16
days,'' Buxton said. Their high-fat diet for energy included bacon,
Russian sausage, peanut butter and the Indian dish pemmican which
consists of dried meat and fat.
   ``Everybody experienced a real high at coming in sight of land
on the northern coast of Ellesmere,'' said Buxton, who said he
became so lonely that he proposed to his girlfriend by shortwave
radio message from the high Arctic. ``I was missing her pretty
badly.''
   Dental hygienist Nancy Burton said yes and was waiting for him
when he got home.
   The Canadians spoke little Russian and vice versa.
   ``There was a language barrier at first,'' Buxton said. ``The
cold made it very difficult to come out of your thick insulated
shell to communicate. We didn't become open and start to talk about
our problems and feelings until the second half of the trip.
   ``But there's an old Eskimo proverb that if you spend three
months with a man on the ice, you will come away knowing his
language. I think we learned to communicate and got around a lot of
the suspicions,'' he said.
   The official leader of the expedition, Moscow mathematician
Dmitri Shparo, told an Ottawa news conference he expects the men
will remain fast friends.
   ``The Canadians are very strong, very beautiful, very
intelligent,'' Shparo said. ``They will be my good friends a very
long time into the future.''
   The expedition began from the northern tip of the Severnaya
Zemlya archipelago in Siberia on March 3 and reached the Pole on
April 26.
   Ambassador Rodionov said the trek showed that even in extreme
conditions, people are able to overcome cultural barriers.
   The team will undergo four days of medical tests in Ottawa
before going their separate ways. ``Like the Canadians, we're
homesick too,'' said Shparo.

<HEAD>Lawyer For Wife Of James Brown Withdraws Diplomatic Immunity
Motion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for the wife of singer James Brown
says he plans to withdraw a motion asking for diplomatic immunity
for his client because her husband was once praised as the ``No. 1
ambassador.''
   Attorney Allen W. Johnson had asked a Richmond County State
Court judge to dismiss misdemeanor traffic charges on grounds that
Adrienne Brown has diplomatic immunity.
   Mrs. Brown, 38, was charged with driving under the influence of
drugs, speeding and criminal trespass Sept. 3, 1987. She pleaded
innocent, and the case is expected to go to trial later this month.
   Johnson's motion, made Tuesday, was based on a statement made by
U.S. Rep. Douglas Barnard, D-Ga., two years ago on James Brown
Appreciation Day in Augusta, which lies close to Brown's home on
Beech Island, S.C. ``James is indeed our No. 1 ambassador,''
Barnard said.
   Johnson's motion said Brown ``is America's No. 1 ambassador and
as such should have diplomatic immunity and such immunity extends
to his wife, the accused herein.''
   Johnson said Thursday he would withdraw the motion, adding that
he filed it only because every possible defense had to be explored.
He said he has since determined that the congressman intended his
comments as a goodwill gesture and a figure of speech.
   Diplomatic immunity shields officials of foreign nations from
criminal charges while they represent their countries in the United
States.
   The Browns have recently had several highly publicized fights,
and Brown has said he plans to file for divorce.

<HEAD>Unresolved Issues In US-Soviet Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's fourth summit with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev left many unresolved matters, and the
joint communique issued by the two leaders acknowledged that
``serious differences remain.''
   Here are the unresolved issues:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>`START' TREATY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   It was once hoped that the summit would be crowned by an
agreement to slash long-range nuclear weapons 30 to 50 percent. But
the leaders made only modest progress on a strategic arms reduction
treaty. On mobile missiles, the two sides agreed to restrict them
to designated territories so they could be counted more easily. But
the dimensions of the areas were not set. The superpowers did not
resolve two other problems, monitoring cruise missiles aboard
warships and whether the U.S. anti-missile research program can be
squared with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   Both leaders said it was still possible to reach agreement on a
START treaty during the Reagan administration, but there seemed
little real prospect for a breakthrough.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   There was disagreement and no resolution of the issue of
conventional weapons in Europe. Negotiations are ongoing in Vienna
between the countries of the Warsaw Pact and NATO alliance. There
had been hints that Gorbachev might unilaterally withdraw 50,000 to
100,000 troops from Eastern Europe to gain a public relations
advantage in the negotiations. That did not occur, however.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHEMICAL WEAPONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Like conventional arms, the issue of chemical weapons is the
subject of multilateral treaty negotiations under way in Geneva.
There was no resolution at the summit of the Soviet goal of a
U.S.-endorsed sweeping ban on lethal chemical weapons. The U.S.
says it wants a ``global chemical weapons agreement'' which can be
verified.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>REGIONAL CONFLICTS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On Afghanistan, Soviets already have agreed to withdraw from the
country under a U.N. agreement signed this spring. Moscow says it
tends to abide by its agreement, but has also hinted serious
problems over continued U.S. arms shipments to the rebels funneled
through Pakistan.
   On Angola, where U.S. and Soviet officials have been trying to
arrange a withdrawal of 40,000 Cuban troops from the country, the
two sides set a September deadline for completing a deal on the
withdrawal. But there was no resolution of how to accomplish that
withdrawal. Any withdrawal would have to be accompanied by
implementation of U.N. resolution 435, calling for an end to the
South African occupation of Namibia, another unresolved issue.
   The United States wants the Soviets to stop selling weapons to
Iran in the Gulf war and to pressure Vietnam to remove its troops
from Cambodia. The United States also wants the Soviets to end aid
to Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The Americans were unable to
enlist Soviet support for an embargo against Iran, but some signs
of movement appeared on the Cambodia issue, with the Vietnamese
promising last week to pull all their troops out by 1990. The
subject of Nicaragua was brought up, but no apparent progress was
made.
   On the Mideast, the Soviets want a full-blown international
peace conference to reach a settlement, while the United States
favors a mostly ceremonial conference that would lead to bilateral
talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Gorbachev said there
had been a ``drawing closer of our positions'' and that the Soviets
are ready to consider restoring diplomatic relations with Israel
once an international conference is convened. But unresolved are
Palestinian participation in the conference as well as the nature
of that conference.

<HEAD>Banking Committee Approves Tighter Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee has added its
support to legislation that would cut virtually all economic ties
with the apartheid government of South Africa.
   The Democratic-controlled panel on Thursday endorsed the bill by
a 34-14 vote, largely along party lines. The measure would escalate
the economic pressure imposed two years ago when Congress passed a
limited sanctions law over President Reagan's veto.
   A similar bill had been approved May 3 by the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, and the legislation still must be considered by
several other House panels before being sent to the full House for
a vote.
   The bill would force a virtual cutoff of U.S. economic ties to
South Africa, forcing divestiture of U.S. investments within a year
and prohibiting most exports and imports. It also would tighten
restrictions on U.S. lending to South African companies and would
ban U.S. military and intelligence cooperation with Pretoria.
   Approval came after the panel narrowly adopted, 27-24, an
amendment offered by an opponent of the legislation, Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., that would have the effect of making it even
tougher, but at the same time more difficult for Congress to pass.
   The amendment would have extended South African import
prohibitions to include not only products from that country, but
products from other countries which contain components or parts
made in South Africa. The provision would affect many items
containing industrial diamonds, among other products.
   McCollum argued that the move would prevent other countries from
stepping in to snap up the share of trade given up by the United
States. But opponents said the provision would be impossible to
enforce because of the difficulty of tracing the origin of items
like diamonds.
   ``This is an effort to kill the bill with pseudo-kindness,''
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   In 1986, the latest year for which figures were available, U.S.
direct and indirect investment in South Africa totaled an estimated
$4 billion. Total bilateral trade for that year was roughly $2
billion. A recent congressional report noted that since 1984, 156
U.S. companies have withdrawn from South Africa and another 157
still have direct investments or employees there.
   The Reagan administration is strongly opposed to the
legislation, preferring instead a policy of ``constructive
engagement.'' That policy calls for maintaining political and
economic ties to South Africa in the belief that such ties give the
United States more leverage to promote reforms in South Africa's
system of racial separatism.
   Several members of the Banking Committee expressed concern that
U.S. banks would suffer from the increased lending restrictions,
which would ban rescheduling of outstanding loans.
   Chairman Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., noted that there had been a
flurry of lobbying against the measure by banking interests, who
argued they would be forced to sell off South African loans at
discounts.
   A primary sponsor of the sanctions bill, Foreign Affairs Africa
subcommittee chairman Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., acknowledged there
would be some costs for a limited number of U.S. interests, and
said some South Africans could realize short-term benefits.
   ``I wish there were a way to add pressure without cost or
inconvenience to American business,'' Wolpe said. ``But there is no
way to do that.'' He said it is in the long-term best interests of
the United States to avoid what he termed ``an evolving war''
between the races in South Africa.

   National Spelling Bee winner Rageshree
Ramachandran says she's not sure what profession she'll pursue, but
she already knows that hard work pays off.
   ``Study as much as you can, and don't stop after the eighth
grade because it's what comes later that counts,'' is her advice to
other would-be champions.
   The 13-year-old from Fair Oaks, Calif., outlasted runner-up
Victor C. Wang of Camarillo, Calif., in a grueling 45-minute,
one-on-one finale Thursday.
   Her winning word in the 61st annual contest, sponsored by
Scripps Howard newspapers, was ``elegiacal,'' an adjective used to
describe the couplets, or pairs of lines, in some poems.
   As the judges nodded their heads that she had won and the
hundreds of spectators in the hotel ballroom applauded and cheered,
she stepped back from the microphone and a smile spread across her
face.
   ``Anything I go into would involve writing, even if it's math or
science,'' the eighth-grader said later.
   Rageshree, who was born in India and whose parents are both
statistics professors, said she had studied spelling for at least
two hours daily since January, helped by her mother, father and
younger sister.
   Victor, a 14-year-old from Camarillo, Calif., stumbled when he
misspelled ``stertorous,'' replacing the first ``o'' with a ``u.''
The word is an adjective used to describe harsh, snoring sounds.
   For a while, neither child had much luck as they were asked to
spell a series of words that both proved unable to pin down. After
Victor misspelled ``balmacaan,'' a loose overcoat, and a bee
official spelled it correctly, the eighth-grader drew laughter from
an equally perplexed audience by asking, ``Who makes up these
words?''
   Rageshree won $1,500 and several other prizes, while Victor
garnered $1,000.
   It took 935 words to find a winner from the record field of 200
hopefuls. After Wednesday's first day of competition, 144 of them
remained.
   The competitors began falling faster Thursday as the words were
drawn less frequently from study lists that had been distributed
and more often from Webster's Third New International Dictionary,
the contest's bible.
   As the second day wore on, the words increasingly drew gasps of
puzzlement from the audience and audible sighs of relief from
contestants who had threaded their way through the puzzles they had
been given.
   Iris Liu, the tournament's youngest competitor ever, lasted
until the fifth round. But Iris, a Muncie, Ind., third-grader who
turns nine on June 20, lost her way spelling ``waywiser,'' an
instrument that measures distance, offering ``weighweiser.''
   Reaching the finals was a feat in itself. The 200 finalists had
started among 8 million to 9 million competitors who entered local
bees across the country. The 102 girls and 98 boys in the finals
came from 47 states, the Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, the
district of Columbia, and Mexico.
   Contestants won $750 for finishing in third place, $500 for
fourth, $400 for fifth, $300 for sixth, $200 each for seventh
through 10th, $100 each for 11th through 20th. The remaining 180
received $50 each.

   The U.S. Postal Service is turning to
businessman H. Ross Perot for help in finding ways to improve
efficiency and save money.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank announced on Thursday that
Perot has accepted a $500,000 ``no-profit'' contract to analyze
five areas of postal operations and recommend improvements.
   The Dallas computer systems billionaire announced formation of a
Washington-based company, Perot Systems Corp., to take on the
contract.
   The deal calls for Perot's company to identify potential savings
in transportation, telecommunications, delivery, revenue protection
and transportation equipment.
   The Postal Service is ``pretty darn good ... but I want to be
better than that,'' said Frank, who has been in office 91 days.
   After the not-for-profit period expires the company will be
eligible for a share of any savings that result from the studies.
   ``I hope it's a lot,'' said Frank.
   Perot said eight top managers at his former company, Electronic
Data Systems, resigned Friday to join his new venture. That was the
first date on which Perot was permitted to hire EDS workers under
an agreement reached in 1986 when General Motors bought out his
interest in the company.
   That settlement also prohibited Perot from launching a new
for-profit business that would compete with EDS prior to 1989.
Hence, the no-profit postal contract.
   The studies will not focus on changes in labor contracts, Frank
said, although he said union leaders will be involved in
discussions with Perot. Some 80 percent of postal costs are
labor-related.
   Frank said he wants to find 10 to 20 areas in which the agency
can save $100 million or more apiece, annually.
   The Postal Service spent $32.5 billion last year, with a loss of
$223 million. A rate increase that took effect April 3 is aimed at
pulling the agency back into the black, but costs continue rising
as volume grows.
   Frank said he would like to spread out the time between postage
rate increases, which have been occurring about every three years.
   ``My goal is one more increase between now and the end of the
century,'' he said at a news conference.
   ``Let the record show that knowledgeable people in the room
laughed,'' he added quickly, ``but you have to have goals.''
   ``Right now,'' he later admitted, ``it looks as if we're going
to have to push ourselves just to keep to the three-year cycle.''
   Asked if the Perot deal had been opened to bids, Frank said it
was not.
   ``It's probably safe to assume there aren't a lot of firms
around the beltway lusting after no-profit contracts,'' he said.
   Perot said his new company's sole client is the Postal Service
and that while it may acquire others in the future, it is not
intended to compete with EDS.
   Frank said he and Perot met for the first time last February,
after Perot turned down the postmaster general job and Frank
accepted it.

   The House ethics committee is moving
cautiously toward a hot political decision on whether to launch an
investigation into allegations that Speaker Jim Wright violated the
chamber's standards of conduct.
   Wright, D-Texas, is publicly pressing for a quick resolution of
the matter _ and insisting he'll be cleared. But the leaders of the
panel of six Democrats and six Republicans said they were most
interested in being thorough.
   Committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said after a 2{-hour
closed-door session Thursday that the panel had not decided if a
preliminary inquiry into the charges against Wright was warranted.
   ``The members of the committee had a thorough discussion ... of
the issue and we have come to no resolve,'' he said. Another
meeting was scheduled for next Thursday, he said.
   Rep. John Myers of Indiana, the panel's senior Republican
member, said there were ``a lot of issues and it takes time to do
it thoroughly.''
   The committee has a strict policy of silence until it completes
action on any case. Thursday's meeting was its first on the Wright
case.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., filed a complaint last week accusing
his political enemy Wright of several possible ethical breaches.
House rules require the ethics committee to examine any complaint
filed by a member, and Gingrich has requested that an independent
counsel be hired to handle the speaker's case.
   Gingrich's complaint cited published reports that Wright
received unusually high royalties for his book that was printed by
a Texas associate who did nearly $300,000 in business with Wright's
campaign.
   It also pointed to actions by Wright on behalf of Texas oilmen
with whom he had a financial relationship.
   In one case, Wright lobbied former Egyptian president Anwar
Sadat concerning an oil well in territory Egypt was taking from
Israel as a result of the Camp David accord. In the other, Wright
contacted federal regulators.
   Wright has insisted his actions were what any congressman would
do on behalf of his constituents and did not violate House rules.
   ``I've said all along I have no fear or apprehension about them
looking into these charges,'' he said. Clearing them up quickly was
important, he said, because ``it reflects the mood and the
reputation of the House as an institution'' as well as his own
standing.
   Democrats are also concerned that Wright's troubles will hurt
their effort to win the White House in November. Republicans are
trying to use the case to blunt Democratic attacks on alleged
misdeeds in the Reagan administration.
   The ethics committee, officially called the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, is the only panel in the
Democratic-controlled House which is equally divided between the
two parties.
   Just prior to Thursday's committee meeting, House Republicans
moved to make sure they had all six of their allotted members
present and voting for the investigation.
   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., recovering from a lung transplant
operation, resigned his committee seat and was replaced by Rep.
Hank Brown, R-Colo.

<DATELINE>SAN VICENTE, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massive peasant protests are
getting bigger, bloodier and more frequent, signaling strains on
Colombia's centuries-old social system in which the rich get richer
and the poor stay barefoot and hungry.
   Since President Virgilio Barco took office on Aug. 7, 1986,
peasants have conducted 80 rural marches, some of them numbering
more than 10,000 people,
   The latest marches began May 22 when thousands of peasants
gathered at a half dozen spots throughout the north.
   One near the mountain town of San Vicente, about 160 miles north
of the capital, ended in gunfire, leaving 10 peasants, an army
colonel and two other soldiers dead.
   The protests indicated the government appears unwilling to
reform its economic system. They also showed a surprising unity
among unions, peasants and leftist parties _ in their discontent if
not in their goals.
   Indeed, leftist guerrillas, apparently not finding enough
revolutionary zeal in the countryside to suit them, have taken to
forcing peasants to participate in the marches.
   Two peasants in the San Vicente march told The Associated Press
in interviews that leftist guerrillas told them to join the protest
or be killed. Others said they knew guerrillas were conscripting
peasants for the march.
   Together with reports by cattle ranchers that the rebels are
forcing them off their land, it is becoming apparent that
Colombia's 10,000 leftist guerrillas are de-emphasizing the urban
battle and concentrating on the countryside.
   The protests were organized by four organizations, the National
Peasants Association; the country's biggest union, the Workers'
Unitary Center; and two leftist parties, the Patriotic Union and
the People's Front.
   The Patriotic Union is the political arm of the country's
largest leftist guerrilla organization, the Colombian Revolutionary
Armed Forces, a rebel group that follows Moscow's communist
ideology.
   The People's Front is the political arm of a Maoist guerrilla
group, the People's Liberation Army.
   The march organizers said the peasants were demanding an end to
right wing death squads who have killed more than 800 persons in
the last three years.
   The peasants also wanted a tax on oil produced by foreign
companies, the organizers said.
   However, when the peasants were interviewed it was obvious they
do not share the same views as the march organizers.
   The peasants never mentioned the death squads or oil. They just
said they wanted decent pay and to see their children be better off
than they are.
   Rural children in Colombia seldom go beyond the fifth grade.
Schools beyond that level simply don't exist in many parts, and
when they do, it costs too much for books, uniforms and room and
board for peasants to enroll their children.
   Around San Vicente the peasants earn $1.50 for a 10-hour day of
picking cacao beans and clearing land.
   That doesn't go far. A small loaf of bread is 35 cents. A pound
of meat costs a day's wages.
   The government apparently is not getting the message about the
possibility of more severe social upheaval in Colombia.
   While President Barco is in Europe and the United States on
state visits, the minister of government, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo,
is the acting president.
   He said in a speech after the tragedy that ended the San Vicente
peasant march that he hoped the peasants learned their lesson.
   There is little hope the Congress will do anything. It has
trouble getting a quorum on days when it should be in session.
   San Vicente belies the grief that dwells in the town.
   The town has a big, white, colonial church, a small, shady
plaza, houses with red-tiled roofs and lots of flowers and pack
animals tied in front of stores.
   But interviews with dozens of townspeople indicated that about
200 people in the San Vicente area have been killed by right wing
death squads in the last year.
   Storeowners had called a strike in sympathy with the peasant
protest. Few of the stores in town were open anyway because the
march had stopped the flow of meat and vegetables from the
countryside.
   But the funeral parlor was open. Employes there said they barely
can keep up with demand for coffins.
   Three coffins with peasants killed during the protest march were
in the funeral parlor. A dozen candles flickered in the otherwise
unlighted room.
   The only sounds were weeping and the padding of peasants'
sandals and bare feet on the cement floor as they wandered in an
out of funeral home.

<HEAD>Proposed US Drug Czar Would Have $2.6 Billion Bank Account</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Declaring that Congress cannot
``micro-manage'' the war on drugs, a House panel is proposing
creation of an administration drug coordinator who would have an
instant $2.6 billion bank account.
   The novel, flexible approach was unveiled Thursday by the six
Democrats and three Republicans of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on commerce, justice, state and the judiciary _ the
panel that dispenses most of the nation's drug war money.
   Chairman Neal Smith, D-Iowa, said the House leadership has not
taken a position on the legislation.
   Traditionally, Congress allocates a set amount to an agency, and
breaks down how much should be spent for each major function over a
particular period.
   But Smith said Congress cannot keep up with the changing needs
of the more than 30 front-line drug fighting agencies. The
coordinator would therefore decide how to dispense the money based
on the needs of the moment, Smith said.
   ``There is no way that the Congress can ... micro-manage a war
on drugs any more than the Congress could micro-manage a war on the
battlefield,'' he said.
   Smith offered this example of how the system would work:
   ``As an opportunity to curtail imports becomes available, more
money may suddenly be needed for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, FBI, Border Patrol, Coast Guard, Immigration and
Naturalization Service, or one of the agencies involved in this
aspect.
   ``On the other hand, if there have been some big busts, more
money will be needed for the courts, for the Marshal's Service, for
the prison services, for prosecutors' offices and various other
agencies involved in enforcing the law.''
   The legislation is an appropriation bill, which means the money
would become available immediately if the president signed it.
Usually, omnibus drug bills are authorization measures that state
Congress' intent to provide money, but separate appropriations
measures are then needed to actually make it available.
   Passage of an authorization does not guarantee that the
appropriation will be approved, or will be as much as the
authorized spending ceiling.
   The new proposal would exceed the budget ceiling reached at a
``summit'' agreement between President Reagan and Congress late
last year. The agreement permitted additional spending for dire
emergencies, a designation provided for the drug war money bill.
   Previous bills have called for a ``drug czar'' with authority to
coordinate strategy among different agencies. This bill differs,
because the coordinator's only job would be to dispense the money.
   Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said the use of illegal drugs is the
type of emergency the summit agreement had in mind.
   ``Despite our best efforts, drugs are increasing in
availability. Violence associated with these drugs is growing at a
similarly alarming rate,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, Rogers predicted a ``tough fight'' to win passage
of the legislation because of budget constraints facing Congress.

<HEAD>Military Says U.S. Runs Clandestine Radio Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's military has charged that a
U.S. government agency is operating a clandestine radio station to
destabilize the government.
   The Defense Forces' press office, in a statement Thursday, said
the opposition Radio Constitucional is run by the Foreign Broadcast
Information Service, which it said is a CIA operation.
   The broadcast service collects information on everything that
happens in Latin America, particularly Panama, the communique said.
It said the operation is based in the former Panama Canal Zone.
   The statement was the latest in a series issued by the military
accusing the United States of plotting to undermine the government.
   The U.S. Embassy denied that Radio Constitutional is linked to
the Foreign Broadcast Information Service.
   It said in a prepared statement that Foreign Broadcast has been
a part of the embassy since 1979 and that it gathers information
from newspapers and radio and television broadcasts and sends it to
Washington.
   The embassy statement said the reports are open to the public
and available to foreign governments by subscription.
   Before becoming a function of the embassy, Foreign Broadcast was
a part of the U.S. Southern Command, it added. The command is the
headquarters for U.S. military activities in Latin America.
   Radio Constitucional apparently is operated by Panamanians
opposed to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, chief of the 15,000-member
Defense Forces and the country's de facto leader.
   The station has a very weak signal and few listeners are able to
find it or keep it tuned in for long.
   Noriega is under federal indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges. The Reagan administration has imposed economic
and trade sanctions against Panama in an effort to oust the general.

<HEAD>NASA Budget Authorization Faces Senate Cutback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has passed an $11.5 billion
authorization bill for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration that faces almost certain cutback in the Senate.
   The bill, passed Thursday on a 360-26 vote, includes $967
million to start building a manned space station, but nothing for a
free-flying, unmanned factory in space favored by the Reagan
administration.
   Some senators have expressed an inclination to vote for no more
than $10.2 billion for NASA during the fiscal year that begins Oct.
1, an amount that could kill the space station project.
   The House authorization bill puts a cap of $24.2 billion on the
total cost of the space station, which is planned to be in orbit
around Earth and occupied by astronauts at the end of 1996.
   The measure authorizes NASA spending for three years _ $14.4
billion in 1990 and $15.7 billion in 1991. The amount for 1989
would be an increase of 29 percent over the $8.9 billion authorized
for this year.
   The bill authorizes no funds for the proposed mini-space station
that would be carried into orbit by the space shuttle, then leased
by NASA from its developers for $700 million over five years.
   It establishes a 12-member ``National Mars Commission'' to
prepare a detailed proposal for a joint manned mission to Mars with
the Soviet Union.
   Development of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite,
which is strongly opposed by the Reagan administration, is
authorized by the bill. And the House calls for a flight
demonstration of a hypersonic space plane _ one capable of flying
at least five times the speed of sound _ by 1995.

<HEAD>Soviet Purchases Fueling Growth in Farm Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Growth of U.S. farm exports is being fueled
mainly by larger Soviet grain purchases, according to Agriculture
Department economists.
   Soviet purchases account for 68 percent of the total volume
increase this year. At 77.3 million metric tons, total farm exports
are running 21 percent ahead of the first six months of 1987, USDA
economists say.
   Thus far this year the Soviets have purchased 9.3 million metric
tons of U.S. farm commodities with a value of more than $1 billion,
according to a world production and trade report issued by USDA
earlier this week. The exports have been mainly wheat, corn,
soybeans and soybean meal.
   In the first half of last year, the Soviets bought 335,700 tons
of U.S. commodities with a value of $42.7 million.
   Japanese purchases of U.S. commodities were up in the first six
months of the year by more than 2 million metric tons, with big
gains in wheat, corn, grain sorghum, soybeans, vegetable oils and
horticultural products.
   Chinese purchases increased by 1.5 million metric tons. The
primary increases were in wheat, corn, soybeans and baby chicks.
The same commodities were the leaders as Korea enlarged its buying
by 695,000 tons and there also was a marked rise in sales of
cotton, cattle hides and fruit juice.
   Wheat has been outpacing all other commodities as American
exports surge, largely because of the lower dollar, federal export
programs and reduced supplies abroad attributable to adverse
weather.
   Wheat exports in the first six months of 1988 were 8.8 million
tons, or $764 million, above the comparable figures for 1987. Corn
posted a gain of 3.4 million metric tons, soybeans 898,000,
vegetable oils 483,000, horticultural products 322,000 and cotton
136,000 metric tons.
   The Soviet Union and China have been major wheat buyers along
with various North African and Mideast nations. The fastest growing
market for high-value products, such as vegetable oils, meat and
almonds, have been the European Community and the middle and
high-income countries of the Pacific Basin.

   The changing international trade picture comes
under review as a major farm women's group, Women Involved in Farm
Economics (WIFE), comes to Washington for its annual government
affairs seminar.
   ``International trade decisions have a very direct and immediate
effect on everyone in production agriculture,'' said a statement
from WIFE President Alice Parker of Royal City, Wash.
   In specific, the group will focus on current discussions aimed
at revising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the
free-trade agreement under which the United States and Canada are
planning to phase out tariffs between the two North American
neighbors.
   Delegates from 22 states plan to be on hand to personally try
their hand as Capitol Hill farm lobbyists.
   The two Agriculture Committee chairmen, Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la
Garza, D-Texas, and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., are jointly
sponsoring a legislative affairs breakfast Tuesday as part of the
seminar.
   A panel of experts ranging from federal officials to a grain
company lobbyist will be on hand to make sure the trade issue gets
a full airing.
   Delegates also will get an update from attorneys on a lawsuit
filed by WIFE against the Agriculture Department, contending that a
farm wife should not be barred by payment limitation provisions of
the farm program from getting federal subsidies to which she
otherwise would be entitled.
   A federal court recently found in favor of the group.
   The department had been barring some payments under legislation
aimed at barring families from increasing their federal payments
merely by restructuring the ownership of their property.
   Environmental concerns also will be spotlighted at the session.

   World tobacco production this year is being
forecast at 6.5 million tons, a 5 percent increase over the 1987
harvest, the Agriculture Department says.
   China's projected 19 percent increase to a record 2.3 million
tons is largely responsible for the rise, according to and world
production and trade report released by USDA on Thursday.
   Chinese plantings were larger than expected following an
increase of 30 percent in producer's returns last year for
flue-cured tobacco, which represents about 80 percent of that
country's harvest.
   U.S. production is likely to increase 11 percent because of
higher production quotas for burley and flue-cured tobacco, USDA
said.

   A group of about 200 former high-ranking
military officers is launching a campaign to challenge the widely
held belief that Israel needs the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
to defend itself.
   The Council for Peace and Security plans to use videotapes of
popular war heros to contend that the nation's defense will be
enhanced, not compromised, if it gives up the occupied lands, said
council coordinator Moshe Amirav.
   ``Our first message is that there is nothing to be afraid of _
the state of Israel is strong,'' Amirav said.``We are not standing
on Massada and we are not in the ghetto.''
   He was referring to the historic persection of Jews. Massada is
the desert fortress where Jews killed themselves rather than
surrender to Roman rule in the 1st Century A.D. Ghettos were the
walled areas in which European Jews were forced to live.
   The council's plans, decided at a meeting Sunday, were outlined
by Amirav and several former generals. They concern strategy for
the occupied lands after an Israeli withdrawal.
   The council was formed last April and is not affiliated with any
political party. But its campaign is timed to have an impact on
national elections Nov. 1 in which security is expected to be a
major issue.
   Amirav said he hoped the generals could dispel the widespread
perception that anyone who favors territorial compromise is
``soft'' on national defense.
   ``We are going to kill a lot of holy cows, and people are going
to get very angry,'' he said.
   The generals argue that ruling over 1.5 million hostile
Palestinians poses a greater threat to Israel's security than
returning the land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
   They say the occupation saps the army and the unresolved dispute
could spark an attack by combined Arab forces of a million soldiers.
   In exchange for giving up some land, Israel could insist on
certain defensive arrangements, said council member Yosef Geva, a
businessman and reserve army major general.
   Amirav said the country then could devote the bulk of its
energy, funds and manpower to developing the economy, strengthening
the army and solving other pressing problems.
   But Israelis who have lived through six wars in 40 years are
wary of returning to narrow, pre-1967 Israel and fear what would
happen if an armed Palestinian state were formed next door.
   To counter their fears, the council has discussed such security
options as making the West Bank a demilitarized zone, keeping
Israeli outposts in the area or stationing an international force
there.
   It plans to convey its ideas through videotapes of generals who
fought in Israel's wars and even drop fliers from planes onto
crowded beaches in the summer.
   But even before the campaign got under way, right-wing
politicians attacked the council, which is made up of scholars and
businessmen as well as 30 major generals, 80 brigadier generals and
100 colonels, all in the active reserve.
   ``Don't be such big heroes,'' said parliament member Rafael
Eitan, the hardline politician who was the army's chief of staff
during Israel's 1982 Lebanon invasion. ``When people are free of
responsibilities, their tongue is long.''
   Geula Cohen, whose Tehiya party favors annexing the territories,
accused the group of working for Foreign Minister Shimon Peres'
Labor Party.
   Labor favors giving up some lands seized in 1967 to win peace
with the Arabs. The rival Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir is against returning any Arab land.
   Amirav, who was expelled from the Likud for holding secret
meetings with Palestinian leaders, said hard-line politicians use
fear to manipulate the Israeli public and gain votes.
   ``They present security and peace as opposites ... but we will
stop this, and show that peace is security,'' Amirav said.
   Shlomo Gazit, a reserve major general and former head of army
intelligence, noted that demographic trends indicate the Arab
population in Israel and the territories could outnumber the Jewish
population in the next century because of higher Arab birth rates.
   If that happens, he said, Israel may have to withdraw
unilaterally from the territories and not have the luxury of
demanding security arrangements.

<HEAD>Report Says Labor Turmoil Could Pose Safety Threat At Eastern</HEAD>

   Labor turmoil at Eastern Airlines must be
defused before it creates risks to passengers, says a federal
report that nonetheless concludes Eastern and sister carrier
Continental Airlines are being run safely.
   The report came after an unprecedented investigation of both
Eastern and Continental as well its holding company, Texas Air
Corp., by the Transportation Department and the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   The department's report, released Thursday, said Eastern's
bitter labor problems have divided the company, posing the risk of
``an adverse impact on the public safety.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration plans to continue its
special surveillance of Eastern and a special emissary is being
dispatched to try to ``de-escalate the tensions within the
company,'' said Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley.
   Burnley said former Labor Secretary William Brock has been
enlisted to try to open new lines of communications between
Eastern's labor unions and management over safety issues.
   Brock's role is limited to ``the safety related aspects of this
problem,'' and Brock would not deal with bargaining issues.
   Brock said he had talked with all the parties at Eastern and has
found ``a willingness to listen.'' But Burnley seemed less
optimistic.
   ``Frankly, given the extraordinary nature of this matter,
neither he (Brock) or I can predict a successful conclusion,''
Burnley told a news conference.
   Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo welcomed Brock's participation.
   Henry Duffy, the president of the Air Line Pilots Association,
suggested the move reflects ``the unprecedented problems that exist
at Eastern.''
   In Miami, Charles Bryan, the head of Eastern's machinists union,
gave no sign of wanting to be conciliatory. He accused the
Transportation Department of ``supporting and cooperating'' with
Lorenzo and called the department's report ``the best possible
report that money can buy'' - a reference to Texas Air's recently
expanded lobbying efforts in Washington.
   The dispute has been a result of Texas Air's demand for wage
concessions from the unions representing Eastern employees, and
from its attempt to sell off assets in what the unions say is an
attempt to dismantle the airline it acquired in November 1986.
   Lorenzo characerized the overall DOT findings as confirming that
Eastern and Continental ``are absolutely safe and absolutely fit.
Those airlines passed inspection with flying colors.''
   The DOT began its close scrutiny of Eastern, Continental and
Texas Air in mid-April, including special inspections by the FAA
that covered 630 Eastern and Continental aircraft over a 30-day
period.
   During the inspection period, 30 percent of Eastern's 280 planes
had to be be taken out of service at least once because of safety
violations. At Continental, safety violations resulted in 14.3
percent of its 350 planes being taken out of service at least once.
   About 7 percent of the 1,542 inspections at Eastern and 3
percent of the 2,689 inspections at Continental resulted in safety
violations being discovered, according to the agency.
   FAA officials have characterized many of the infractions as
being minor with many of them involving fuel or hydraulic leaks or
miscellaneous problems. ``An unsafe condition does not currently
exist'' at either Eastern or Continental, said FAA Administrator
Allan McArtor.
   Burnley, meanwhile, said that the department's in-depth
examination of Texas Air Corp., the holding company for both
Eastern and Continental, found nothing to substantiate concerns
about the company's management or finances.
   The review by a special task force of DOT lawyers and auditors
concluded that:
   _ Despite the company's $466 million in losses last year, it has
``substantial assets and access to capital'' and that both
Continental and Eastern are considered financially viable in the
near term.
   _ No evidence was found that a series of controversial financial
transactions by Texas Air Corp., including the sale of Eastern's
lucrative computer reservation system and the proposed sale of its
Northeast shuttle, were an attempt to ``bleed'' Eastern's assets.
   _ Texas Air's management is ``fit willing and able'' to operate
a commercial airline company and there is ``no basis for serious
concern about (Texas Air) management's competence.''

   When the vice president of the United States,
the certain Republican nominee to be the next president, kicks
around two conservative activists few Americans ever heard of,
eyebrows go up and the question is asked, ``Why did George Bush do
it?''
   Even defenders of Richard Viguerie and Howard Phillips conceded
on Thursday that they had done plenty the past seven years to
provoke a sharp reaction from Bush.
   In an interview published in the New York Times, Bush dismissed
the pair as ``almost self-appointed spokesmen.''
   ``I've been pounded by these two people for years,'' he said.
   But for the most part they have ignored the vice president and
concentrated their fire on Ronald Reagan, whom they accused of
abandoning the conservative agenda.
   Viguerie, a pioneer in direct-mail fund-raising for conservative
causes, denounced Reagan on the final day of the Moscow summit as
``America's No. 1 apologist for the Soviet Union'' and suggested
the president had ``taken leave of his senses.''
   Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, has been equally
critical of the president.
   But was there anything for Bush to gain politically from his
attack? Was he taking a risk? Do Viguerie and Phillips have a
following that Bush desperately needs to defeat Democrat Michael
Dukakis in the fall presidential election?
   Given that Bush is confronted almost daily with polls saying
Dukakis is running ahead of him nationwide and in several key
states, many Republicans doubted the wisdom of alienating even
people with a small following.
   ``It's a mistake to publicly come out and write off anybody,''
said Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., a former chairman of the
American Conservative Union. ``Unless,'' he added ``he was doing it
to try to establish to whatever audience that he's not a
right-winger. But nobody has ever thought he was.''
   To the small band of GOP moderates, though, Bush's words were a
welcome signal.
   ``I think that Bush is making it clear that while he is
conservative on many issues he is not a tool of the new right
forces,'' said Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa. ``That has implications for
policy as well as for appointments.''
   ``It doesn't serve George Bush any useful purpose to attack
people who have constituencies that might support him,'' said Lyn
Nofziger, former White House political director.
   ``He's not running against Dick Viguerie and he's not running
against Howie Phillips; he's running against probably Mike Dukakis
and you really ought to keep your eye on the ball,'' said Nofziger.
   ``He won the nomination,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., a
leader of House conservatives. ``He deserves the respect of the
conservative movement.''
   But how much of the conservative movement can Phillips and
Viguerie claim to represent?
   Bush descreibed them as ``two individuals who don't have any
following.''
   Phillips, asked how much of a following he has, said Bush ``does
not have to worry about me, I only have one vote.'' He said
Conservative Caucus has several hundred thousand supporters.
   Edwards said Viguerie and Phillips ``are not the conservative
movement, they're just a couple of guys.''
   ``I think they have a very tiny following,'' said Gingrich,
``and a very large press kit.''
   But that brings up the original question: why would a man of
Bush's stature publicly attack two people with so little following?
   ``Obviously, they've gotten to him,'' said Eddie Mahe, a
Republican political consultant, who called the attack ``totally
out of character'' for a man who believes campaigns ``function
better when they are inclusive rather than exclusive.''
   Rep. Robert Dornan of California, a Bush supporter, said: ``I
think it's kind of sad. I was hoping he wouldn't react to their
earlier goading. ... I thought the whole thing was calmed down and
we'd all be pulling together on one team.''

<HEAD>Constituent Assembly Gives Sarney Five-Year Term, Election In 1989</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers rejected an attempt to call an
early presidential election and allowed President Jose Sarney to
complete a five-year term ending in 1990 even though polls
indicated that voters want elections now.
   The Congress, sitting as a Constituent Assembly to rewrite the
Constitution, on Thursday voted 328 in favor of a five-year term
and 222 in favor of four years.
   Leftist lawmakers wanted the election in November this year, but
the assembly decided the country's estimated 75 million eligible
voters will go to the polls in November 1989. Brazilians have not
voted for a president since 1960.
   The voting, which began after nine hours of debate, was
interrupted repeatedly by shouts of ``elections now'' and ``Sarney
out.'' After the vote, legislators unveiled a huge sign that read:
``Five years: betrayal of the people.''
   Polls taken over the past year consistently have shown a
majority of Brazil's 143 million people want presidential elections
this year.
   The five-year term is subject to a final vote, but political
analysts say it will pass when the entire constitution is voted
chapter by chapter later this year.
   The issue has been one of the most heated of the Constituent
Assembly, which already has approved the five-year term for future
presidents. The current constitution gives presidents a six-year
mandate.
   Lawmakers elected in 1986 have been spending the last 14 months
writing a new constitution to replace the one handed down by a
military junta in 1969.
   Sarney, 57, took office in 1985 as the running mate of Tancredo
Neves, who died before taking office. Neves was a civilian selected
in an electoral college vote to pave the way for non-military rule.
The military government had ruled since a 1964 coup.
   Sarney, who was leader of the military-backed Social Democratic
Party before taking office, has often alluded to a military threat
if the assembly shortened his term. Sarney still counts the
military chiefs among his closest supporters.
   ``My duty is to leave the nation institutionalized and not allow
the climate of freedom and consolidation to turn into a Prague
spring,'' Sarney said in a recent interview with the respected
daily Gazeta Mercantil newspaper.
   Sarney was referring to the popular protests demanding
democratic reforms in Czechoslovakia 20 years ago that were crushed
by Soviet troops.
   Sarney has maintained that uncertainty over his term has kept
him from properly running the country, deprived him of a strong
political base and is a reason for Brazil's economic problems.
   Critics charge Sarney has only been concerned with his term,
allowing inflation to soar to a projected annual rate of 600
percent and investment to drop to almost zero.

   Paul McCartney will become the first Western star
to release a record album exclusively in the Soviet Union, his
record company has announced.
   EMI said Thursday the 13-song collection of rock'n'roll classics
will be distributed in October under the Soviet Melodia label.
   ``Since the Beatles' days many of my most loyal fans have been
in Russia,'' said McCartney, whose hits include ``Back in the
USSR.''
   ``It has always concerned me that these people hear our music
many years after its release or through illegal importing and home
taping. The new spirit of friendship has enabled me to make this
gesture to my Russian fans,'' McCartney said.
   The Soviet Union has been establishing new ties with the West
under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, and his plans to restructure his country's economy.

   Ryan White, the 16-year-old AIDS victim rejected
from school because of his disease, assured students they can't get
AIDS from casual contact and said, ``I don't want anyone to go
through what I went through.''
   ``You can't get AIDS from sitting next to someone with AIDS ...
or using the same bathroom or kissing someone,'' White told
students at P.S. 87.
   Wednesday's question-and-answer session with the Indiana youth
was recorded for a television special on AIDS to be broadcast this
fall on the Children's Television Workshop program ``3-2-1
Contact.''
   White, a hemophiliac who contracted AIDS from a blood
transfusion, was asked how he coped with the reaction to his
disease. In addition to waging a court battle for his right to
attend school, the White family was ostracized, their car tires
slashed and their house pelted with eggs.
   ``It hurt, but I tried to ignore the name-calling and stuff like
that. ... I don't want anyone to go through what I went through,''
White said.
   Students said they profited from the session. ``At first I
thought I could get AIDS from just touching someone,'' said
Jessalyn Sanchez. ``Now I know you don't.''
   Added Stephanie Pitsirilos: ``I'll remember that even if someone
has AIDS, you can't judge him.''

   Donald Regan, the acerbic former White House chief
of staff, says his move from the corporate boardroom to the
political backroom was a rough change that few businessmen should
try.
   But Regan, the former chairman of Merrill Lynch & Co., had only
good things to say Thursday about his former boss. ``I think Ronald
Reagan will likely go down as one of our most underrated
presidents.''
   Later, he told reporters at an international conference of bond
dealers that he has not spoken with Reagan since his controversial
book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington,'' was
released.
   The book describes first lady Nancy Reagan's role in forcing
Regan out of office, her consultation with an astrologer to
schedule events for Reagan and Regan's perception that the
president is placid and hesitant to make decisions.
   The former treasury secretary encouraged businessmen to enter
government service, but he said politics is not for everyone.
   ``You've got to be prepared for a lot of heartache and
headache,'' Regan said, as well as a pay cut.
   Regan, who left the White House last year, said he was shocked
by his first monthly paycheck as treasury secretary. ``What is
this, the tip?'' Regan quipped.

<HEAD>Study: AIDS Will Kill 99 Percent of Those with Virus</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-AIDS Commission Bjt</HEAD>

   AIDS eventually will kill 99 percent of the
people infected with the virus, according to a new study that says
it takes an average of 7.8 years for the disease itself to show up.
   The fatality projection contradicts the suggestion of some that
only a small percentage of those infected with the AIDS virus will
actually develop the disease.
   ``We've got to expect the worst. We've got to assume that it
will happen,'' said William W. Darrow, a researcher with the
federal Centers for Disease Control and co-author of the report.
``That's the message of this study.''
   The study, conducted jointly by the CDC and the San Francisco
Department of Public Health, is to be published Friday in the
magazine Science. It found that the incubation period for the AIDS
virus _ the time from exposure until development of a
life-threatening disease _ averaged 7.8 years among 84 homosexual
men who were proven by blood tests to have been infected with the
AIDS virus.
   Darrow said that CDC mathemetician Kung-Jong Lui analyzed the
health records of the 84 men, who had taken part in a hepatitis
study between 1978 and 1980. Blood samples taken for the hepatitis
study were reexamined for the human immunodeficiency virus which is
the agent that causes AIDS.
   Using the blood samples, the researchers were able to determine
within a few months the date on which the men were infected with
the virus.
   The study then followed the medical history of the men and found
that 21 had developed AIDS by January 1987.
   Lui projected the average incubation period from exposure to HIV
to expression of AIDS at 7.8 years.
   ``This result implies that the AIDS epidemic will continually
increase for the next several years if no effective treatment
becomes available to prevent the progression of HIV-1 infection
from an asymptomatic stage to clinical AIDS,'' the study said.
   Earlier studies have shown that persons infected with the HIV
virus can develop antibodies to the virus within a matter of
months, and that the virus then can remain latent for a long period
before patients develop the deadly diseases associated with AIDS.
   Darrow said Lui's study establishes a model for projecting the
probable outcome of the average patient who has tested positive for
AIDS.
   George W. Rutherford, co-author of the study and an executive
with the AIDS office of the Department of Public Health in San
Francisco, said the study is important because it will help
officials plan an allocation of resources to treat the disease.
   ``Though this is only a math model, it is important because it
addresses the incubation period of AIDS,'' said Rutherford. ``This
is one of the major variables.''
   He said San Francisco now expects to have 17,000 cases of AIDS
by 1993 and is making plans to provide care for this number of
critically ill patients. Other cities, Rutherford said, can use
this model to make similar plans.
   AIDS, short for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, attacks the
body's immune system, killing cells that protect the body from
disease. When the cells are destroyed, the patient becomes
susceptible to infections and rare cancers that often are fatal.
   AIDS generally is spread through sexual contact, among drug
users who share needles, infected blood or blood products, and from
infected pregnant women to their babies.
   As of May 23, AIDS had been diagnosed in 62,740 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 35,188, had died, according to the CDC. No
one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

   After 24 pianists had played on two ``ordinary''
Steinway grand pianos for nearly four hours, stagehands unveiled
and pushed to the center of the Carnegie Hall stage the 500,000th
Steinway built in America.
   Wendell Castle, introduced as America's premiere furniture
designer, who created the ebony piano's case with its unusually
large sculptured legs, took a bow.
   ``Who's going to be the first to play on it?'' asked master of
ceremonies David Dubal, one of the 24 pianists. Somebody yelled:
``Van Cliburn.'' Dubal continued: ``The future of piano music, Mr.
Albert Kim.''
   Kim, who studies at the Manhattan School of Music, played
several short pieces and an encore.
   Cliburn and his mother, Rildia Bee Cliburn, who started giving
her son piano lessons when he was 3, had just been on stage. From
Steinway's president, Bruce Stevens, Cliburn received an award of
achievement for professional excellence and inspiration to young
performers.
   Cliburn did not play.
   Most of the pianists who did play are not world famous.
   Three among the best known, Lazar Berman, who came from Moscow,
Alexis Weissenberg and Shura Cherkassky, born in 1912, were saved
until after the second intermission Thursday night. And all three
were splendid.
   They were followed by 19 pianists alternating between two pianos
to play the 22 sections of Schumann's ``Carnaval.''
   Before that, the best known pianists were Grant Johannesen, Ruth
Laredo and Misha Dichter, who played a two-piano duet with his wife
Cipa.
   Each piece was short and introduced by Dubal or Hai-Kyung Suh.
   Other pianists participating were Navah Perlman, born in 1950,
daughter of violinist Itzhak Perlman, Peter Orth, Joseph
Kalichstein, Robert Taub, Jose Feghali, Leon Bates, Jean-Yves
Thibaudet, Miss Suh, Christopher O'Riley, Alexander Toradze,
Barbara Nissman, Stephen Hough, Alec Chein, Ilana Vered, Edmund
Battersby and Jerome Rose.
   The evening celebrated the 135th anniversary of the piano
company in America and was a benefit for the Steinway Foundation,
which is being set up to promote the composition and performance of
piano music.
   The new piano, valued at $500,000, will be taken on a world tour
with stops in the Far East, Europe as well as the United States.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Meets With Gang Members, Blames Desperation for
Violence</HEAD>

   Jesse Jackson walked into the heart of the
city's gang territory and emerged shaking his head after hearing
tales of violence, drugs and failed government policies.
   ``In a real sense they feel they have no way out,'' said the
Democratic presidential contender. He was flanked by a dozen
members of the Bounty Hunters offshoot ``set'' of the Bloods gang,
whose violent lives were depicted in the film ``Colors.''
   With Secret Service agents at his side, the Democratic candidate
met with reporters after a two-hour meeting Thursday with gang
members inside the gymnasium at the 5,000-resident Nickerson
Gardens project, a housing area plagued by gang crime.
   Desperation was the message heard by Jackson, whose candidacy
and interest in the community briefly eased its sense of
hopelessness.
   ``I'm glad he came, I think it's a lot of hope,'' said Maurice
Washington, 16, who identified himself as a member of the Bounty
Hunters.
   Another gang member who met with Jackson, identifying himself
only as ``Dog,'' said the violence will stop only when parents
wrestle back control of their children.
   ``I told him (Jackson) to tell these parents to watch their
kids. Police ain't gonna do it. It's gotta start in the home,''
said Dog, pointing to the seemingly endless rows of
graffiti-scarred buildings in the projects.
   ``They believe unlimited access to guns and drugs compounds the
crisis because a combination of the drugs, the guns and the money
creates a kind of unholy triangle in the situation,'' Jackson said.
   ``A gang is nothing but an organized group of people who form in
an act of desperation and hopelessness and turns to unacceptable
anti-social behavior,'' Jackson said.
   He complained that government programs and services aimed at
heading off gang violence and helping residents of the gang-plagued
neighborhoods aren't coordinated.
   ``After all these killings, why hasn't leadership on all levels
been convened?'' asked Jackson. He condemned the lack of day care,
job training and scholarship recruitment in Nickerson Gardens.
   ``One young man said there are no equal rights, there are only
equal wrongs,'' the candidate said.
   ``I offer the youth today a partnership,'' Jackson said. ``I
will have to fight the flow of drugs. They must cut demand for
drugs.
   ``In many ways these young people, these grapes, have been
turned into raisins. Grapes of hope are now raisins of despair.
Their powers to believe have been turned into cynicism,'' the
candidate said.
   The Jackson campaign touted the meeting in the gang-infested
projects as a private dialogue with leaders of the Bloods and
Crips, but those at the table were actually former members and
young low-echelon members.
   ``It doesn't really make any difference,'' Jackson said.
   City Councilman Nate Holden pointed out: ``Here, you never
really get out of a gang.''
   Steve Valdivia, the director of Community Youth Gang Services
which helped arrange the meeting, was impressed with Jackson's
visit.
   ``In a community that reproduces gang members, an environment
where there is no choice but to be on the wrong side of the law, I
can see a need for 10 Jesse Jacksons,'' Valdivia said.
   ``We don't have those leaders here. Leaders here don't see
beyond there own limited agenda,'' he said. ``The fact is law and
order is not the end-all to everything. Jesse Jackson realizes
that's not where it starts or ends. It always has been, and always
will be, social and economic issues.
   ``When a man like that comes in and says he cares and wants to
do something about it, and has the power, then I'm all for it.''
   Asked why leaders of the Crips and Bloods weren't in on the
meeting, Valdivia explained there are over 250 sets of Crips and
Bloods.
   ``There is no way in the world you can get all those groups
together in one place and have peaceful co-existence,'' he said.
   More than 380 people were killed in gang violence in Los Angeles
County last year.
   Some local residents _ many of whom have lost friends and
relatives to gang shootings _ expressed hope at the attention
Jackson brought to their concerns, but also skepticism that any
changes could be achieved.
   ``I don't know, I doubt it,'' said James Tapla, 17, who
described himself as a Bounty Hunter ``marked'' by rival gangs.
   ``You can't go nowhere without somebody wanting to beat you down
or shoot you. I lost three close friends'' to gang violence, he
said. ``I'm tired of it. It's time for this to stop.''

the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   Officials from the Foreign Ministry also said Thursday that
Japanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno is expected to urge Israel to
withdraw from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip when he visits
Israel at the end of June.
   Japan plays a small political role in the Middle East but its
economic role, especially its purchases of oil and its exportation
of high-technology equipment, is substantial.
   ``Since the Israeli invasion into Lebanon in June 1982, Japan
has consistently called for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Koichi Haraguchi told a
regular news conference. ``I'd like to take this opportunity (on
the sixth anniversary) to reaffirm that there has been no change in
this policy.''
   Referring to Israel's actions against Arab protesters in the
occupied territories, Haraguchi said, ``the current handling of the
Palestinian people in those areas is not kindly welcomed and we
express our hope that the current conduct will be stopped
immediately.''
   Foreign Minister Uno is scheduled to visit Israel as part of a
six-day, four-nation Middle East tour beginning June 22. He will be
the highest ranking Japanese official ever to visit Israel, the
officials said.
   About 200 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip since the anti-occupation uprising began nearly six
months ago.

<HEAD>Dukakis Tops Jackson in Statewide Poll, But Jackson Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis held a solid lead over rival Jesse Jackson, according to
the latest survey here, but Jackson was gaining ground, the poll
suggested.
   The survey, taken by the San Francisco Examiner and television
station KRON, indicated the Massachusetts governor led Jackson by
24 percentage points, 52 percent to 28 percent. Twenty percent were
undecided.
   The poll of 600 registered Democrats, questioned on Tuesday and
Wednesday, had a margin of error of 4 percentage points, the
Examiner reported in Thursday's editions.
   A similar survey, taken in mid-May, suggested Dukakis was
leading by 37 percentage points, 60 percent to 23 percent.
   ``While Jackson has shown growth the last couple of weeks, he
continues to have an extremely narrow base,'' said Examiner
pollster Stephen Teichner. ``He faces a pretty big task in closing
the gap.''
   Teichner said a low turnout on election day would help Jackson
because his base appears to be ``extremely committed.''
   In the more recent poll, black voters were backing Jackson by a
72 percent to 9 percent margin in the most recent poll. Asians
continued to overwhelmingly support Dukakis, by a margin of 61
percent to 20 percent. Hispanics split 47 percent to 34 percent in
favor of Dukakis.

   Police officers today surrounded a
bank where two armed robbers were holding 17 hostages and waiting
for a crowd outside to disperse so they could make a getaway.
   The gunmen had demanded a getaway car and about $50,000. Police
said additional money and the vehicle had arrived at the bank late
Thursday. Authorities said the building did not hold enough to
satisfy their demand.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   Twenty police officers were stationed around the Bank of Brazil
office in Goioere, a town of about 20,000 people about 550 miles
southwest of Rio.
   Police inspector Alcides Lorenzo said there were no customers
among the hostages, who were all male bank employees.
   ``Everybody is calm, we're just waiting for the negotiations to
end,'' a man who identified himself as teller Jose Marques told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from inside the bank. He
said he was one of the hostages.
   Marques, 38, said the hostages had not been threatened or hurt
and that they were free to walk around the bank. He said they were
not frightened.
   Police inspector Jose Barbosa Souza said the additional money
arrived in two armored trucks and was transferred to a car that
police provided for the robbers getaway.
   Barbosa said the robbers were demanding that the branch manager
and assistant manager, who were among the hostages, and Goioere's
police chief leave with them in the car.
   He said the robbers told police they would wait through the
night until a crowd of about 3,000 people that had gathered around
the bank building thinned. Those standing outside the bank were
relatives and friends of the hostages, as well as onlookers.
   ``The robbers said not to worry about the hostages, they will be
safe,'' Barbosa said. He added that police were trying to persuade
onlookers to go home.
   Barbosa said the robbers talked security guards into opening the
doors shortly after the bank closed, pretending to be late
customers. He said they took out revolvers and grabbed security
guards' guns.
   Barbosa said the bank alarm, connected to a local police
station, rang at about 6 p.m. but he didn't know what time the
robbers had entered the bank. Brazilian banks usually close their
doors to customers at 4:30 p.m.
   All security guards and an undetermined number of female bank
tellers were freed, Barbosa said.
   The robbers demanded about $50,000 and an escape car, Lorenzo
said. He said authorities requested the additional money from a
Bank of Brazil branch but declined to specify which office.
   Bank robberies have become increasingly common in Brazil, where
inflation is running at a projected annual rate of 600 percent and
the cost of living for the average worker has soared by about 60
percent over the last two years, according to labor union studies.
   Police often have allowed robbers to flee in order to save
hostages' lives.

   The surgery being performed today on Kitty
Dukakis, wife of Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis, is aimed at relieving spinal cord pressure that could
cause nerve damage and even paralysis.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 53, wife of the Democratic presidential
front-runner, has herniated discs. This is a common and, for most
victims, not very serious hazard of middle age and beyond.
   However, Mrs. Dukakis' case is more complicated and difficult.
Instead of having just one damaged disc, she has two of them. And
instead of being in the lower back, where most occur, hers are in
her neck.
   But worst of all, her discs are pushing on her spinal cord. And
this, if uncorrected, could eventually cause permanent damage and
perhaps paralysis of the lower parts of her body.
   Mrs. Dukakis had been bothered by the condition for weeks, but
in recent days it had grown worse, causing numbness and altered
sensations in both her hands and feet.
   She checked into Massachusetts General Hospital for evaluation
on Wednesday night, and by Thursday the doctors had made their
decision: Immediate surgery was necessary.
   ``In view of the fact that this condition has quite definitely
worsened in the past 24 to 48 hours, it was felt that waiting even
until next week was taking a chance,'' said Dr. James R. Lehrich, a
neurologist.
   However, he added that Mrs. Dukakis's condition appeared to have
been spotted early, and there was no sign of permanent harm to her
spine.
   The operation, which he described as major surgery, is called
cervical laminectomy.
   Mrs. Dukakis's problems result from two herniated _ or slipped _
discs in her neck. These discs serve as soft cushions between the
bony vertebrae that protect her spinal cord.
   In her case, the discs between the fourth and sixth vertebrae
below her skull were squeezed out of place so that they pressed on
the spinal cord.
   At Boston University Medical Center, Dr. Ronald Mortara said
most people with herniated discs are treated first with bed rest,
traction and pain killers. Surgery is used only as a last resort.
   ``If you keep that up for a few weeks, a great number of people
will get better and not need further treatment,'' he said. ``If
someone has any evidence of spinal cord compression, that becomes
much more serious and urgent.''
   Lehrich said disc troubles can result from an injury or occur
spontaneously, and the doctors are unsure what caused Mrs.
Dukakis's problems.
   ``We have seen no trauma, unless you consider that she has been
a dancer and moved her neck a lot,'' he said.
   Mrs. Dukakis has been a student and teacher of modern dance for
three decades.
   The goal of the operation was to remove bone from Mrs. Dukakis's
hip and use it to replace the damaged discs. Her recovery in the
hospital was expected to take one or two weeks or longer.
   Lehrich said that serious complications of the surgery are very
rare, although they can include paralysis if the spinal cord is
damaged.
   Mrs. Dukakis's condition was diagnosed in California, where her
husband, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, was campaigning for
the state's primary.

<TEXT>
   A former Franciscan monk serving an 18- to
20-year sentence for assault and battery will meet his pen pal,
Mother Teresa, on Saturday when she begins a visit to three state
prisons at his invitation.
   Donald Ouimet, who has corresponded with Mother Teresa for the
past two years, said he hopes her visit will spread ``the healing
warmth of love'' among inmates at the prison 20 miles south of
Boston.
   ``Walpole prison has been recognized as a holding pen for the
lowest of the low. But every now and then a ray of hope shines,''
Ouimet told a news conference Thursday inside Massachusetts' only
maximum-security prison. ``I hope this Saturday a ray of hope will
shine when a little nun from India comes.''
   Mother Teresa _ who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prizefor her work
with the destitute, diseased and dying _ established the Missionary
Sisters of Charity in Calcutta, India, in 1948. Today, the Roman
Catholic order operates more than 30 homes in 80 countries.
   The Yugoslavian-born nun will also visit prisons at Concord and
Framingham, traveling by helicopter, said state Department of
Correction spokeswoman Kathleen Ayres.
   At Walpole, inmates plan to present Mother Teresa with a pen
drawing of the nun in front of a comment she once made: ``We are
like a pencil in God's hands, even though the instrument is
imperfect, the writing is beautiful.''
   Ouimet said inmates were excited about her impending arrival,
and said he hoped her visit would uplift them.
   Ouimet, encouraged by a prison chaplain and a New York City nun,
began writing Mother Teresa in 1986 and first invited her to visit
last year. He has written continually, and has received four
letters from her.
   Ouimet said he has been religious all his life. After graduating
from a parochial high school in Holyoke in western Massachusetts,
he became a Capuchin Franciscan monk, joining the St. Pius X Friary
in Middletown, Conn., as a lay brother.
   After four years there, Ouimet left. He said he's still not sure
why.
   ``It was springtime and the birds were singing, and I wanted to
live the good life,'' said the gregarious Ouimet. ``Little did I
know the good life would lead to the good life behind bars.''
   In 1965, just a few years after leaving the monastery, Ouimet
was convicted of aggravated assault. He served nine years at
Walpole before his release in 1974. Ouimet returned to western
Massachusetts and worked odd jobs, mostly as a cook.
   Around 1985, he was arrested in four separate incidents of
aggravated assault, Ouimet said. He said he assaulted a man and a
woman in the incidents, but did not provide details.
   ``That's not the issue,'' he said. ``What's here and now is the
issue. I have nothing, no life in the streets. My life is in here.''
   Though Walpole is known as a tough prison, Ouimet said he
doesn't want to leave despite being eligible for parole in 10
years. He said he believed the 1985 assaults might have resulted
from an unconscious desire to return to prison.
   ``I prefer it here, there's security, I don't have to pay rent,
don't have to pay for lights,'' Ouimet said. ``I'm comfortable
here.''
   Ouimet said he plans to continue corresponding with Mother
Teresa, who he says has broadened his outlook. He hopes his fellow
inmates will have the same experience when they meet her Saturday.
   ``We are poor in spirit, poor in emotion and poor in material
possessions,'' he said, ``but in the eyes of our Father we have a
great dignity.''

<HEAD>Nicaragua Says Contras Attack Troops From Honduran Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua said rebels based in
Honduras attacked army troops inside Nicaragua and accused an
official of Nicaragua's leading business organization of running a
spy network for the CIA.
   On Wednesday, the Honduran armed forces claimed Sandinista army
soldiers attacked the San Agustin military post located six miles
inside Honduras a day before. Honduras said the Nicaraguan troops
were driven off and that an unknown number were killed.
   Nicargua's Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said Thursday the
fighting occurred in Nicaragua and that a soldier had been captured
and taken to San Agustin.
   Responding to a protest note by Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos
Lopez, D'Escoto said:
   ``The crude manipulation of the facts contained in your note
reveals the real aim of this campaign _ to try to create an
incident between Honduras and Nicaragua'' and to undermine peace
talks between the leftist government and the U.S.-supported rebels,
known as Contras.
   ``Acts that occurred in Nicaragua are being presented as if they
occurred on Honduran soil and ... the armed forces of Honduras
takes upon itself crimes that in reality have been committed by the
Contras,'' he said.
   The Contras have maintained bases in Honduras throughout the
6-year-old civil war. The two sides agreed to a temporary
cease-fire on March 23 while they continue negotiations on a
permanent truce.
   The Interior Ministry said Mario Jose Alegria Castillo, director
of the Institute of Economic and Social Research, had worked for
the CIA since 1985 and ``organized a network of informing agents in
some institutions of the Nicaraguan state.''
   Alegria Castillo was detained on Tuesday.
   In a statement released Wednesday night, the ministry said Pedro
Su Olivas of the Central Bank and Adrian Espinales of the Ministry
of Commerce also were arrested.
   Alegria Castillo and his secretary, Dora Aldana Centeno, were
``tied to the crime of stealing documents with a secret
classification by the Nicaraguan state,'' the ministry said. Mrs.
Aldana Centeno was detained briefly Tuesday and released.
   The research institute is affiliated with the Superior Council
of Private Enterprise and publishes economic information bulletins
based on official and private publications.
   In a statement issued Thursday night, the Council said Alegria
Castillo's detention was ``nothing more than another manuever of
the familiar routine'' of the government.
   It said Sandinista security agents confiscated several documents
from the offices of the council and the research institute,
including material published by the Central Bank. The agents warned
council and institute employees that ``the possession of this
material was illegal,'' the statement said.
   Enrique Bolanos, president of the council, said Wednesday the
detentions were illegal.

   Palestinian inmates complained of heat,
hunger, and humiliation to foreign journalists who toured this
prison camp for the first time since the six-month uprising began
in the occupied territories.
   This center in the Negev Desert held 2,483 Palestinians,
detained without trial. Of those, 2,061 have been sentenced to up
to six months in jail.
   Many are teachers, journalists, doctors and community leaders
imprisoned to prevent the spread of unrest, which began Dec. 8.
   The journalists talked Thursday with the prisoners, who live in
clusters of open tents.
   ``They said I was active in politics, but I believe I am here
because I am a journalist,'' said Qasem Ali, who worked part-time
for The Associated Press.
   ``I think conditions here made the people more radical and
created more hatred and this is the problem,'' said Ali, 29, who
stood behind a fence topped with barbed wire. He smoked one of five
cigarettes given to each inmate daily.
   Prisoners complained of being made to kneel, hands behind their
backs, for lengthy, twice-daily roll calls in the scorching heat at
the prison, located near the Egyptian border 20 miles south of the
occupied Gaza Strip.
   Being made to kneel was the principle complaint of Abdel Aziz
Randisi, a pediatrician from Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip who was
jailed for six months without trial on March 20.
   Randisi said prisoners who break any of the camps manifold rules
are forced to kneel.
   ``I will refuse. Really, our hearts are grieving, and we would
rather die than do this kneeling,'' he said.
   At one point, prisoners brought out Saad Dahdour, 21, of Gaza,
who had a bruise over his right eye and said he was made to stand
in a toilet and beaten after arguing with guards about treatment
for a toothache.
   Other complaints included a ban on mass gatherings that
prevented group prayers on the Moslem Sabbath, not enough water to
bathe frequently to wash off the desert dust, small portions of
food, infrequent newspapers and a ban on radio and television.
   Col. David Tzemach, the camp commander, showed reporters a
storeroom with fresh produce and large amounts of canned meat. He
also cited round-the-clock medical care and frequent visits by the
Red Cross.
   Referring to complaints that inmates were made to sit in the hot
sun for 30-minute roll calls, he snapped: ``They are liars. They
don't sit in the sun for that long. It only takes 10 minutes for a
roll call.''
   He said mass gatherings were banned after Friday prayer services
turned into political rallies with Palestinians singing nationalist
songs and, in one case, throwing stones.
   Tzemach recalled that on one occasion more than 100 prisoners
reported sick with stomach aches and fevers, but doctors found only
three to be sick.
   ``It was just a big show,'' he said.
   Prisoners also said family visits were not allowed. Tzemach said
these were suspended after a bus carrying visitors was stopped in
the occupied West Bank and burned by Arab protesters who opposed
such visits since they involved cooperating with the Israelis.
   Rejecting accusations of beatings, Tzemach said the maximum
punishment was three days in an isolation cell, a punishment
usually imposed only for those who try to incite revolt or violence
against guards.
   ``For minor offenses like refusing to come out for roll call,
prisoners are made to stand in the corner,'' the camp commander
said.
   Earlier this week the human rights group Law in the Service of
Man urged that the camp be closed, saying the conditions were
``inhumane.''
   It said prisoners were moved from the occupied territories into
Israel, in violation of the Geneva Convention governing the
treatment of civilians in occupied areas.

<HEAD>Aspirin Makers Agree With FDA In Urging Caution Over Heart-Attack
Findings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trade group representing aspirin makers agrees
with the government's caution that aspirin may do more harm than
good in some patients who want to reduce heart-attack risk, and
that more research is needed.
   Dr. Thomas Bryant, president of the Aspirin Foundation, said
Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration is ``eminently
sensible'' in its view that widescale promotion of aspirin to
reduce coronary risk would be premature.
   Taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase some
people's chances of dying of other things, especially hemorrhagic
strokes, the FDA said in a commentary in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Findings released in January indicated that taking an aspirin
every other day reduced the risk of first, non-fatal heart attacks
by 47 percent in 11,000 male doctors over five years, compared with
11,000 who took a non-aspirin substitute.
   The report helped boost nationwide aspirin sales by 41 percent
to about 190 million tablets in the first week of February,
although sales later tailed off to about the level of the previous
year, according to figures from Nielsen Marketing Research.
   The FDA persuaded aspiring manufacturers in March to hold off
advertising aspirin's effects at reducing first heart attacks, and
the Washington, D.C.-based foundation knew the FDA planned to
publish its views this week, Bryant said.
   Aspirin tends to promote bleeding by reducing the ability of
blood platelets to help form clots. Heart attacks usually occur
when clots lodge in the arteries feeding the heart and deprive the
heart muscle of blood.
   But aspirin may increase health risks for people who already
have clotting problems, or for those who have high blood pressure,
which puts them at increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes, the FDA
commentary said.
   Strokes are the result of brain damage caused by bleeding in the
brain or by blood clots. Hemorrhagic strokes are those caused by
bleeding.
   The FDA commentary pointed to 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded
among the 11,000 subjects taking aspirin in the study, compared
with two such strokes among 11,000 subjects taking the substitute.
   Overall death rates for the two groups were the same, though the
aspirin group's non-fatal heart-attack rate was much lower. There
were 104 non-fatal heart attacks among the aspirin users and 189 in
the comparison group.
   ``Physicians will, for a time, be forced to make their
professional judgments about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete
information,'' said the FDA commentary, co-written by agency
Director Dr. Frank E. Young.
   ``We agree with them completely,'' said Dr. Julie Buring, a
Harvard University researcher who participated in the aspirin study.
   She added in a telephone interview Thursday that a further
analysis of the data to try to determine which people will benefit
most is under way, and researchers expect to report to the FDA in
late fall.
   Aspirin has been known since 1985 to reduce the risk of second
heart attacks and certain kinds of heart pain.
   Dr. Robert A. Temple, co-author of the FDA commentary, said
aspirin may be very beneficial at reducing heart-attack risk in
older men, but not beneficial at all in younger women, who tend to
have low heart-attack risks to begin with.
   ``If aspirin were absolutely benign, you wouldn't worry about
this, but it isn't absolutely benign,'' he said in a telephone
interview Thursday.
   The FDA commentary noted that a British study of 5,000 male
physicians found aspirin failed to protect against heart attacks,
and that it was associated with a 2{-fold increase of disabling
strokes.

<HEAD>Artists' Diseases Blamed On Bright Colors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toxic metals in the bright colors favored by four
great artists may have given them rheumatic diseases, according to
a British medical weekly.
   Peter Paul Rubens, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Raoul Dufy and Paul
Klee, who were fond of bright yellow, red, white, green, blue and
violet paints, may have been heavily exposed to the toxic metals in
them, said two Danish doctors in the June 4 issue of The Lancet.
   They said the metals could have caused the rheumatoid arthritis
suffered by Rubens, Renoir and Dufy and the scleroderma, which
leaves the skin hard and rigid, that affected Klee.
   The doctors listed the metals as mercury, cadmium, arsenic,
lead, antimony, chromium, tin, copper, cobalt and manganese.
   ``Exposure to these metals may be of importance in the
development of inflammatory rheumatic diseases,'' said Dr. Lisbet
Pedersen and Dr. Henrik Permin of the University Hospitals in
Copenhagen.
   Rubens lived from 1577 to 1640, Renoir 1841-1919, Dufy 1877-1953
and Klee 1879-1940.
   The doctors said they reached their findings after examining
paintings by the four artists and by eight others without rheumatic
disease, who lived at the same times and who favored paler,
earthier colors containing harmless iron and carbon compounds.
   ``Impoverished artists lived, cooked, and ate in their studios
and water and food could easily have been contaminated by toxic
heavy metals from pigments,'' the doctors said.
   The doctors said that personal habits also had a role.
   Renoir was a heavy smoker of hand-rolled cigarettes so pigments
containing mercury could have been transferred to the cigarettes
from his hands. The studios of poor artists would have been heated
by a stove on which paint-soaked clothes and discarded paintings
would be burned as cheap fuel, giving off toxic metal fumes.
   Some of the artists licked their brushes and thereby ingested
mercury.
   ``Artists today use less toxic pigments, tubes of paint carry
warning labels, and artists know that they should not lick brushes
or burn colors indoors,'' the doctors said.
   ``Artists today are not so exposed, but heavy metal
contamination in food and drinking water exists and experience from
the occupational exposure of Old Masters is still relevant,'' they
said.

catastrophic health insurance bill approved Thursday by the House
and sent to the Senate for final legislative action.
   HOSPITAL _ Full coverage for 365 days a year of hospital bills
after a once-a-year deductible estimated at $564 in 1989. The
deductible is indexed to rising hospital costs. Medicare now
charges a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and
provides full payment for just 59 days a year.
   DOCTOR BILLS _ Full payment of ``reasonable and proper'' doctor
bills after a $1,370 annual cap is met. Medicare continues to pay
80 percent of charges, after a $75 deductible. Both the initial
deductible and the 20 percent patient copayment will count toward
the $1,370 cap. Patient remains responsible for that portion of
fees that exceed the amount allowed by Medicare.
   DRUGS _ Medicare pays 50 percent of outpatient drug costs, after
a $600 annual deductible, starting in 1991. Medicare pays 60
percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter,
with the deductible to be indexed to rising drug costs. Medicare
now has no across-the-board prescription drug coverage.
   COSTS _ To be paid solely by Medicare beneficiaries. Current
Part B premium of $24.80 to increase by $4 a month in 1989. By
1993, the ``catastrophic'' monthly premium is projected at $10.20,
in addition to whatever the regular Part B premium is at that time.
More than 60 percent of total program costs are to be financed by
an additional ``supplemental'' premium that is linked to federal
income tax liability. The supplemental starts at $22.50 a year per
$150 of tax liability in 1989, rising to $42 a year per $150 of tax
liability in 1993.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's human touch warmed a
friendly crowd of peace activists who came to the Kremlin to praise
his policies and offer him gifts ranging from a toy for his
granddaughter to a Chicago Bears sweatshirt.
   On a day that President Reagan left Moscow, Americans and other
Westerners talked excitedly and hugged each other after addressing
Gorbachev and walking up to the front of the Kremlin's circular
Sverdlov Hall to present him with a gift.
   The 57-year-old Soviet leader's wit and self-assurance, which
have overcome the stereotype of old and ailing Soviet leaders,
dominated Thursday's three-hour session with hundreds of peace
activists.
   He combined the style of an American politician on the stump
with the substance of Soviet policies. He defended Soviet positions
on human rights, arms control and ``perestroika'' _ his
restructuring drive.
   The activists, many of whom said they already supported a number
of Soviet policies, applauded frequently.
   Gorbachev praised them for their efforts. ``I can now see that
public initiatives are ahead of politics,'' Gorbachev said.
   Among the gifts he received were a plaque proclaiming his home a
zone of peace, a solar-powered watch, a ``peace now'' T-shirt,
posters, paintings and an American Indian peace pipe.
   ``I think we're going to have an exhibition after this
meeting,'' he said at one point. ``An exhibition of souvenirs.''
   William Sloan Coffin, Vietnam War-era chaplain at Yale
University and former senior minister at New York's Riverside
Church, told Gorbachev the United States has traditionally been
ahead in the arms race, ``but in the race to disarm, the roles
apparently are reversed.''
   ``He's the statesman we've been waiting for,'' said Marty
Coleman of Pasadena, Calif., who presented Gorbachev with a toy
from her granddaughter Amanda to give to his granddaughter Oxana.
   Gorbachev observed that a grandmothers' association existed in
the Soviet Union, but added, ``It's now necessary to create a
grandfathers' association.''
   Later he returned to the theme, addressing a woman who
represented an organization called ``Grandmothers for Peace.'' ``I
suggest the founding of a rival organization,'' he said.
   ``Man, my knees are shaking,'' said Russell Red Bear, an
American Indian representative as he returned to his seat.
   Gorbachev had just autographed a book for imprisoned former
American Indian Movement leader Leonard Peltier, whose case Soviets
often cite as an example of U.S. human rights abuses.
   As is his custom, Gorbachev opened the meeting with a lengthy
statement. Representatives of at least 32 American groups and of
peace organizations from many other countries then lined up at four
microphones spread around the hall to make statements.

<HEAD>Mohawk Indians End Tense Blockade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAHNAWAKE, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tense, 27-hour blockade by Mohawk
Indians from a reservation near Montreal has ended peacefully after
Indian leaders met with officials in Ottawa to air their grievances.
   Mohawk leaders warned however that the barricades, erected
Wednesday after police raids to stem the illegal trade of
cigarettes, might reappear.
   Mohawk Indian late Thursday cleared roadblocks set up across
Highway 132 and Mercier Bridge, which connects Montreal with
suburbs on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River.
   The blockades went up after 200 police officers raided the
reserve and arrested 17 people for selling cigarettes smuggled from
the United States.
   After the raid, Mohawks with rifles slung over their shoulders
parked an 18-wheel truck across the highway and dumped gravel on
the road, closing the major artery and bridge and causing chaos for
commuters.
   The standoff continued until late Thursday. Reporters at Mercier
Bridge said the Indians set up what looked like a machine gun.
   Late Thursday, Earl Karoniakta, a spokesman for the Mohawk
Warrior Society, said the Mercier Bridge will remain clear ``as
long as we're not being jerked around, as long as our people are
being treated like human beings.''
   In Ottawa, a Mohawk delegate to the meeting with Canadian
officials stormed out an hour after it started calling the session
pointless.
   ``Quite clearly ... the talks were not too productive or
successful,'' said Joe Norton, Mohawk grand chief, after emerging
from the meeting.
   Norton said the Mohawks failed to gain a guarantee from the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police that there wouldn't be further raids.
   Acting police commissioner Hank Jensen said after the meeting
the raids were the result of a long investigation, part of ``a
laborious task that you don't launch overnight'' and the force will
do it again when there are ``flagrant abuses'' of the law.
   The Mounties carried out the raid using search warrants and said
they seized $450,000 worth of cigarettes bought duty-free in the
United States.
   Police said the 17 people arrested would probably be charged
with smuggling.
   Canada exempts Indians from taxation but only for goods sold to
Indians. The Mohawks have been importing tax-free cigarettes from
the United States and reselling them to non-Indians. A carton that
would sell for $20 if taxed goes for about $14.50.
   Customs officials estimate the illegal cigarette trade is worth
$16 million a year at two reservations alone _ Kahnawake and the
Akwesasne reserve straddling the border between Cornwall, Ontario,
and Massena, N.Y.
   The raid and blockade came less than 24 hours after Georges
Erasmus, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, issued a
warning that frustration with the federal government's inaction on
Indian concerns could lead to violence.
   Canada's 387,000 Indians have pressed the government for three
years to negotiate constitutional guarantees on Indian self-rule.

   Although he claims to be a favorite son, a recent
newspaper poll indicates Vice President George Bush could face a
close race in Texas in this fall's general election if Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas was on the Democratic ticket headed by Michael
Dukakis.
   The Houston Chronicle poll, released Thursday, showed 48 percent
of those surveyed preferred Bush, the all-but-certain Republican
nominee, while 41 percent said they would vote for Dukakis when
voters were asked to consider only the two candidates.
   However, when the Democratic front-runner was paired with
Bentsen as his running mate, Bush led Dukakis by only two
percentage points, 43 percent to 41 percent, falling within the
poll's three-point margin of error.
   The poll surveyed 785 voters between May 13-28.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. intelligence analyst Samuel Loring
Morison will be allowed to stay out of prison at least temporarily
while he appeals his conviction for espionage and theft to the
Supreme Court.
   Morison had been scheduled to go to prison today for giving
secret satellite photographs of a Soviet ship to a British
magazine. But U.S. District Judge Joseph Young in Baltimore issued
a stay of imprisonment Thursday until June 15, said Morison
attorney Steven F. Reich and Supreme Court officials.
   Earlier Thursday, Supreme Court Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist denied Morison's emergency request asking that he be
allowed to remain free pending a formal appeal to the full court.
   ``Because Morison has not shown that his appeal is likely to
result in reversal with respect to all the counts for which
imprisonment was imposed, his application is denied,'' Rehnquist
said.
   Rehnquist said that even if there is a substantial question
about the propriety of Morison's espionage conviction, Morison
failed to raise a substantial question ``with respect to his
conviction for theft of government property.''
   When Rehnquist denied Morison's appeal, Morison made a similar
petition to Justice William J. Brennan, who referred Morison's
request to the full court, said Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy
Arberg.
   The solicitor general's office then agreed that Morison's
imprisonment should be delayed, and Judge Young issued the stay of
imprisonment. The high court is expected to consider Morison's
request on June 9, Supreme Court officials said.
   Rehnquist has authority over emergency requests from the 4th
U.S. Judicial Circuit, where Morison was convicted.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Richmond, Va.,
upheld the conviction in April, rejecting Morison's arguments that
Congress intended laws against spying to protect against the
distribution of classified material to a foreign government rather
than leaks to the press.
   Morison, grandson of the late Pulitzer Prize-winning historian
Samuel Eliot Morison, was convicted in October 1985 of giving to
Jane's Defence Weekly photographs taken by a U.S. spy satellite of
a Soviet nuclear aircraft carrier under construction.
   Morison, who worked as a civilian for the Navy, also was
convicted of the theft of the photos and government documents
describing a May 1984 explosion at the Soviet Union's Severomorsk
naval base.
   He was sentenced to two years in prison but remained free on
$100,000 bond pending appeal.
   Prosecutors said Morison's actions endangered national security
because the photos revealed how a U.S. spy satellite worked. They
also said he leaked the photos to get a full-time job with Jane's
after doing part-time work for the military journal while employed
by the Navy.
   Defense attorneys contended Morison was trying to educate the
public about a Soviet naval buildup and that the photos told the
Soviets nothing they had not learned already from a 1978 incident
in which the spy satellite's operations manual was sold to a Soviet
agent.
   The case is Morison vs. U.S., A-876.

   A powerful ``second-generation''
anti-AIDS drug could be available within a decade, say scientists
who helped identify the precise target where the AIDS virus latches
onto cells it destroys.
   The study by scientists at the California Institute of
Technology here, Ortho Pharmaceuticals in Raritan, N.J., and the
University of Alabama, Birmingham was published today in the
journal Science.
   The study's chief authors, Caltech molecular biologist Bradford
Jameson and protein chemist Stephen B.H. Kent discouraged excess
optimism that their discovery would lead to a drug to treat or cure
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which cripples the body's
disease-fighting immune system.
   ``We do not want to give people false hope,'' said Kent.
Nonetheless, he said, a drug more effective than those now being
developed could be available in 10 years.
   However, Dr. Mathilde Krim, a founder of the American Foundation
for AIDS Research, said Kent was exaggerating the time it would
take to develop a drug using the new discovery.
   ``If things go very well, I'd say two years until it would be
made available to people,'' Krim, whose organization funded the
$120,000 study, said by phone from New York City.
   ``To my knowledge, it is the first time a binding site has been
identified with such precision for any virus,'' Krim said. ``It's a
wonderful accomplishment.''
   Scientists previously knew the AIDS virus infects T4 white blood
cells and certain other cells by attaching to CD4, a ``receptor''
protein on the cells' surface. T4 cells are the main immune-system
cells destroyed by AIDS.
   Using sophisticated analyses, Jameson identified the exact part
of the CD4 protein to which the AIDS virus attaches, known as a
``binding site.''
   In the next step, crude synthetic copies of the binding site
were manufactured by Jameson, Kent and Caltech biology chairman
Leroy Hood.
   Alabama scientists found that in the test tube, the fake binding
sites acted as decoys to overwhelm AIDS virus particles so they
couldn't latch onto real binding sites on T4 cells.
   If scientists can create more sophisticated versions of the fake
binding site, those might work as a drug to treat or cure AIDS, or
to carry virus-killing drugs to the AIDS virus, Kent said.
   ``This is the first step toward a second-generation drug,'' he
said.
   The finding ``should provide information that will guide future
efforts to develop agents capable of blocking the virus,'' agreed
Dan Capon, a molecular biologist at Genentech Inc., a South San
Francisco company using a similar approach to develop anti-AIDS
drugs.
   Kent and Jameson said their findings are important in learning
how viruses infect cells, and might be use to create drugs to fight
other viruses and treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune
diseases, in which the body is attacked by its own immune system.
Such drugs could also prevent the immune system from rejecting
transplanted organs.
   A major obstacle is that either fake CD4 proteins or fake
binding sites might also prevent the immune system from doing its
job, Kent said.
   However, Krim said that risk should be much lower if fake
binding sites rather than fake CD4 proteins are used in a drug, and
that such risk would be acceptable in treating severely ill AIDS
patients.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Calls For Ban On Suzuki Utility Vehicle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Suzuki Samurai is so unstable it ``literally
trips over its own feet'' and rolls over, says the publisher of
Consumer Reports, which gave the popular sport vehicle its first
``not acceptable'' rating in 10 years.
   But the American Suzuki Motor Corp. defended the Japanese-built
Samurai as safe and said there was no justification for the
magazine publisher's claim that it should be banned because it
tends to turn over in sudden turns.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said Thursday
the Samurai is too short, too narrow, too light and has too high a
center of gravity to be safe. It asked federal regulators to recall
the more than 150,000 Samurais sold in this country and provide
refunds to owners.
   Consumers Union called the four-wheel-drive sport utility
vehicle ``wholly unsuitable for consumer use'' in a petition filed
with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
   ``That car literally trips over its own feet, and I wouldn't
want to be in it,'' said R. David Pittle, technical director of
Consumers Union, at a news conference. ``They're promoted as safe,
fun vehicles, when the fact of the matter is, they're not.''
   Consumers Union said the $8,500 Samurai was the first car out of
349 tested in the last decade to roll over during a routine
accident-avoidance test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid
an obstacle in the road.
   Consumers Union officials showed a videotape in which the
Samurai lurched onto two wheels and began to roll over when it
suddenly changed lanes at just under 40 mph. Arm-like extensions
installed to protect the test drivers prevented the car from
rolling onto its side.
   The Samurai's major competitors, the Jeep Wrangler, the Jeep
Cherokee and the Isuzu Trooper, were shown making the same maneuver
without losing stability at speeds higher than 40 mph.
   It was 10 years ago that Consumer Reports labeled the Dodge
Omni-Plymouth Horizon models ``not acceptable,'' saying they had a
dangerous steering problem. The problem was corrected the next
model year, the magazine said.
   ``We were thinking of turning it over to our older son. Now we
won't do that,'' said Edward Taylor, 41, of Cleveland Heights,
Ohio, who owns a convertible Samurai.
   ``You're driving down the road at 65 mph and a cat or dog jumps
out in front of you, you have to find out how good a driver you
are. It's something I'm not looking forward to,'' he said.
   Doug Mazza, vice president and general manager of American
Suzuki, said, ``We have absolute confidence that we are selling a
safe and stable vehicle.''
   The company said the Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety,
stability and handling before it was introduced in the United
States in November 1985. Suzuki sold 154,675 of them through April.
   ``We are not surprised that professional drivers can cause the
Samurai or other motor vehicles to roll over,'' Mazza said. ``But
the real results of the Samurai safety is proven on American roads
every day.''
   The petition from Consumers Union asked that the government
require similar vehicles to pass driving tests rather than just
meet design standards.
   The Center for Auto Safety filed a similar petition in February,
citing the Samurai's rollover problem. The center said the Samurai
had been involved in at least 32 rollover accidents, resulting in
eight deaths and 35 injuries.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said there
have been 44 reported incidents of Samurais rolling over, involving
53 injuries and 16 deaths. A spokesman for the agency, Ron DeFore,
would not comment on the Consumers Union petition. The agency has
120 days to respond.
   The company says police found serious driver error in all of the
fatal accidents.
   DeFore said he could not comment on whether the Suzuki has a
higher rollover rate than its competitors. He said utility vehicles
in general have a fatality rate that is three times that of
light-duty vehicles, such as small pickups, and that rollovers
account for two-thirds of the fatalities in utility vehicles.
   DeFore said drivers of utility vehicles tend to be younger and
more adventurous than the average driver, and are more prone to
accidents.
   Details of the tests are in a report to be published in the July
issue of Consumer Reports.

   A death row inmate died of a heart attack
a year and a half after he was convicted for the 1986 murder of a
store clerk, authorities said.
   Floyd Wilson West, 42, died Thursday at Providence Hospital,
said Hal Leslie, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections.
   West, a native of Waynesboro, Miss. had a history of heart

   American women are divided over whether the
feminist movement has benefited them, according to a new poll.
   The Lifetime Women's Pulse Poll, conducted for cable television
and released Thursday, found that half the respondents believed the
feminist movement has had no effect on their lives; 41 percent felt
it has had a positive effect; 6 percent a negative effect; and 3
percent had no answer.
   The poll also found that 47 percent of the respondents who work
full time outside the home believe feminism has benefited them,
compared with 27 percent of the homemakers.
   Age had little impact on the answer, said Dina Mirriam, one of
the pollsters.
   On another topic, 53.5 percent of the respondents said the word
``feminism'' has positive connotations; 46.5 percent thought it was
negative or neutral.
   And 59 percent viewed femininity as a positive quality, 41
percent as negative.
   The telephone survey involved 1,000 women, ages 18 to 54,
randomly selected from around the country. They were contacted Feb.
2-16 by Research and Forecasts Inc., a New York-based firm. The
margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percent.

<TEXT>
   President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq's
pledge to hold elections in 90 days initially filled many
Pakistanis with hope, although he had just fired his prime minister
and the entire National Assembly.
   Now, doubt is returning.
   Many observers of this nation's byzantine political machinery
are growing skeptical that those elections will take place as
promised. The disappointment could eventually help galvanize
opponents of Zia, who has dominated this country for more than 10
years.
   The 64-year-old general, who also holds the powerful post of
army chief of staff, dismissed civilian Prime Minister Mohammad
Khan Junejo, his 33-man Cabinet, and the 237-member Assembly on
Sunday.
   He accused the Cabinet and lawmakers of corruption, inability to
enforce Islamic laws, and failure to control lawlessness that
culminated in bloody ethnic and regional rioting.
   His pledge to hold new elections in 90 days conforms to the
nation's constitution. Junejo and all opposition parties are
demanding that the elections be held on time and that they be free
and impartial.
   However, the past few days have given rise to growing doubt in
many quarters about Zia's electoral promise.
   ``There is a growing depression over the possibility of Zia
holding elections within 90 days,'' said a Western diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Over the last four days, the diplomatic community is
developing a concern for a ... vacuum of National Assembly in the
forseeable future, not of early elections,'' the diplomat said.
   Many people who have met Zia over the last four days, including
senior diplomats, reported that the president appeared to enjoy his
return to total authority. Many are concerned the Zia plans to stay
in complete control.
   Zia seized power on July 5, 1977, by toppling Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was later executed. He imposed martial law
and ruled the country single-handedly until March 23, 1985, when he
picked Junejo as prime minister.
   However, the arrangement came to an abrupt end Sunday in the
wake of their growing differences over defense, foreign affairs,
and domestic politics.
   In his public criticism after the dismissals, Zia laid great
weight on the government's alleged failure to promote Islamic law.
   However, he made no mention of such a failure Tuesday while
addressing diplomats in Islamabad, said one participant, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   ``His stress on Islam in his public speeches may have been to
cater to domestic lobbies only,'' said the diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity. The power-sharing between an army-based
president and a civilian prime minister, which Zia himself
introduced in 1985, seems to be ending, at least between now and
the next election.
   A caretaker government, which Zia has not yet named, will remain
without a prime minister. That arrangement will amount to tilting
back to a presidential form of government, giving Zia all the power
once again.

<HEAD>Military Raids Convent to Search For Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CEBU CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military intelligence agents
raided a convent in an unsuccessful search for three Communist
rebels, military and church sources said today.
   Rev. Jose Borces, executive secretary of the Visayas Secretariat
for Social Action, said armed intelligence agents told the nuns in
Wednesday's raid at the Missionary Sisters of Mary that they were
looking for three members of the rebel's Mindanao Commission.
   The agents had a search warrant signed by a judge, according to
Borces, but he said they told the nuns they thought the convent was
a private home.
   Borces said he complained to Cardinal Ricardo Vidal, archbishop
of Cebu, about the raid in Cebu City about 300 miles south of
Manila.
   Col. Geronimo Dumadapat, chief of the area Military Intelligence
Group, said his office had information that the convent was used as
a hideout for members of the banned Communist Party of the
Philippines.
   He said the building had been under surveillance for about a
month before the raid.
   The military has charged in the past that rebels receive support
from social activist priests and nuns. Several priests in the
central Visayas islands have been identified as leaders of the
National Democratic Front, an umbrella organization of 12
underground groups controlled by the Communists.
   On Thursday, the military said religious cultists hacked to
death five Communist rebels in a surprise attack during which they
freed 15 villagers kidnapped by the guerrillas.
   The military also reported gunmen believed to be Communist
rebels shot dead five Philippine Constabulary troops as they played
basketball in Lanao del Sur province of Mindanao island.
   Lt. Col. Edgar Centino, spokesman for the army's 4th Infantry
Division, told reporters that five New People's Army guerrillas
Wednesday kidnapped the 15 villagers near Lianga in Surigao del Sur
province, about 550 miles southeast of Manila.
   Members of the Sacred Heart of Jesus religious cult caught up
with the rebels as they and their captives rested under a tree. The
cultists then attacked with machetes and killed all five rebels.
   The military frequently uses members of religious cults to fight
the rebels.
   Meanwhile, today in Manila, President Corazon Aquino proclaimed
democracy ``the natural shelter of freedom'' as she opened a
conference of 14 nations from Asia, Europe and Latin America which
have cast off dictatorship.
   Mrs. Aquino appealed to the delegates during the four-day
conference to search for ways to ensure that democracy ``retains
its guiding power'' in the world.
   The conference, proposed last year by Foreign Secretary Raul
Manglapus, brings together delegations from the Philippines,
Portugal, Uruguay, Honduras, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Guatemala, El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Greece, Spain, Argentina and the Dominican
Republic.
   Conference officials said invitations were sent to nations which
had overthrown dictatorship since 1973 and taken steps to build
democratic institutions in their wake.

   Commencement day at West Deptford
High School will span two generations for Gloria and Wilbert
Holmes, as the last two of their 18 children receive diplomas with
the first of their 36 grandchildren.
   ``It's the end and it's the beginning,'' said Mrs. Holmes, 58.
``I thank the Lord that it's over for me, but I still babysit every
morning.''
   The Holmes family will fill an entire section at the ceremony.
Only one child cannot attend: Donald, an Army sergeant stationed in
Germany.
   ``One of the most striking things about the Holmes family is
that all of the children have been polite, well-behaved
individuals,'' said William G. Stubbs, the high school's principal.
``None has ever gotten into serious trouble in school.
   ``I wish Mr. and Mrs. Holmes would market their formula for
raising children,'' he said.
   Like many mothers, Mrs. Holmes predicts she will be wiping tears
from her eyes at the June 22 ceremony. But after seeing the
children through school, her husband said he will be cheering.
   ``I'm so glad it's over,'' he said, referring to the graduations
of his two youngest children, 18-year-old Herbert and 17-year-old
Frances. ``Maybe now she (Mrs. Holmes) and I can have some time to
ourselves,'' said the 63-year-old retired maintenance man.
   Mrs. Holmes is a bit more sentimental, and pointed out that her
36 ``grannies'' are constantly at the house anyway. Wayne Young,
17, is only the first grandchild to graduate from high school.
   Mrs. Holmes admitted that over the years, her children sometimes
thought she was too strict. When dining out, for instance, she
never let them ask for seconds ``because people would think that
with so many of us, they were all starving to death. But when they
started having their own children, they began to know what I was
doing.''
   Despite her happy memories, Mrs. Holmes said she does not want
her children to have so many of their own. One son already has six
children, ``and I hope he doesn't have any more,'' she said.
   ``They all have good jobs that they shouldn't give up,'' Mrs.
Holmes said.
   Sally Jordan, a teacher who recalls most of the Holmes family,
said, ``They've been an exceptional group of kids.''
   One time, Ms. Jordan had three of the Holmes daughters on the
field hockey team she coached.
   ``They let me know that their mother made a chart and they had
chores to do and they'd just have to work field hockey around it,''
she said.
   ``I think it's a tribute to fine parents,'' Ms. Jordan said.
``Their parents expected a lot of them and cooperated with the
school system. I've often used them as great examples of the way
kids should be brought up.''

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers rejected an attempt to call an
early presidential election and allowed President Jose Sarney to
complete a five-year term ending in 1990 even though polls
indicated that voters want elections now.
   The Congress, sitting as a Constituent Assembly to rewrite the
Constitution, on Thursday voted 328 in favor of a five-year term
and 222 in favor of four years.
   Leftist lawmakers wanted the election in November this year, but
the assembly decided the country's estimated 75 million eligible
voters will go to the polls in November 1989. Brazilians have not
voted for a president since 1960.
   The voting, which began after nine hours of debate, was
interrupted repeatedly by shouts of ``elections now'' and ``Sarney
out.'' After the vote, legislators unveiled a huge sign that read:
``Five years: betrayal of the people.''
   Polls taken over the past year consistently have shown a
majority of Brazil's 143 million people want presidential elections
this year.
   The five-year term is subject to a final vote, but political
analysts say it will pass when the entire constitution is voted
chapter by chapter later this year.
   The issue has been one of the most heated of the Constituent
Assembly, which already has approved the five-year term for future
presidents. The current constitution gives presidents a six-year
mandate.
   Lawmakers elected in 1986 have been spending the last 14 months
writing a new constitution to replace the one handed down by a
military junta in 1969.
   Sarney, 57, took office in 1985 as the running mate of Tancredo
Neves, who died before taking office. Neves was a civilian selected
in an electoral college vote to pave the way for non-military rule.
The military government had ruled since a 1964 coup.
   Sarney, who was leader of the military-backed Social Democratic
Party before taking office, has often alluded to a military threat
if the assembly shortened his term. Sarney still counts the
military chiefs among his closest supporters.
   ``My duty is to leave the nation institutionalized and not allow
the climate of freedom and consolidation to turn into a Prague
spring,'' Sarney said in a recent interview with the respected
daily Gazeta Mercantil newspaper.
   Sarney was referring to the popular protests demanding
democratic reforms in Czechoslovakia 20 years ago that were crushed
by Soviet troops.
   Sarney has maintained that uncertainty over his term has kept
him from properly running the country, deprived him of a strong
political base and is a reason for Brazil's economic problems.
   Critics charge Sarney has only been concerned with his term,
allowing inflation to soar to a projected annual rate of 600
percent and investment to drop to almost zero.

   Georgia's drought is gripping farmers and
city-dwellers alike, and officials compare it with some of the
state's worst dry spells.
   ``All crops and pastures are in a stressful situation. If rain
doesn't come soon, there's a chance we'll be losing the crops,''
Jerry Midden, agricultural statistician for the Georgia Crop
Reporting Service, said Thursday.
   Row crops, such as peanuts, soybeans and corn, are in serious
trouble, Midden said. ``They're sitting in the dry soil and
withering away.''
   There was a chance of thundershowers today and early next week,
but the rain was not expected to provide significant relief, the
National Weather Service said.
   For the fourth week in a row, the Georgia crop report showed
more than half of the state's soil had less than adequate moisture.
In the Atlanta area, local governments tightened water use
restrictions already in place.
   ``This has got to be treated as a major drought, on a par with
the '50s, the 30s'' and three other major droughts dating back to
the 1840s, said State Climatologist Gayther Plummer.
   California is suffering a milder drought. In a meeting Thursday,
officials reported general success in reducing water use last month
in the San Francisco Bay area, San Jose, and Santa Clara and Marin
counties in Northern California. Rationing reduced water
consumption by 22 percent in San Francisco, said Matt Mullen of the
city water department.
   In Georgia, the northern section of the state is in the worst
shape, running 50 percent of normal rainfall for the first four
months of 1988, Plummer said. The state usually averages 50 inches
of rainfall annually, but has had only 120 inches in most areas
over the past five years, like ``almost one year of rainfall
missing,'' Plummer said.
   The latest crop report showed 30 percent of Georgia's soil had
adequate moisture, 52 percent was short and 18 percent very short.
   ``And that's the fourth consecutive week for those figures. It's
the lowest rating of the season,'' Midden said.
   Because of dry pastures, Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin
has gotten permission for farmers to graze livestock on land set
aside under the Food Security Act of 1985 that normally must lie
fallow.
   Without the additional feed, ``farmers could be forced to sell
off their herd,'' leading to a shortage of cows later this year,
Irvin said Wednesday.
   The Atlanta area is also short of water. The region is 5.4
inches, or 23 percent, short on water for the year, according to
the weather service.
   On Thursday, Lake Lanier, the area's main water source, was 2
feet below its lowest point during the 1986 drought and just 10
feet above the record low of Dec. 24, 1981.
   Water use restrictions were tightened this week in the two
counties that contain Atlanta and many suburbs.
   ``The water consumption was going up instead of going down,''
said Gus Monroe, deputy director of the DeKalb water and sewer
division. ``We have to do something to slow down water
consumption.''
   The city of Atlanta has banned outdoor watering from 7 a.m. to
11 a.m. since November.

   Suspected Sinhalese extremists today
killed two candidates in Sri Lanka's Southern province and burnt
government buildings, a day after they attempted to disrupt voting
in two other provinces.
   A police officer in Colombo said one victim belonged to the
governing United National Party and the other to a communist
alliance.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had no
further details on the killings.
   At least 75 cases of arson in the Southern province, which
electes members to local government councils on June 9, were
reported, he said. The targets were government buildings and
electricity and telephone posts, he said.
   The violence erupted hours after officials announced results of
elections held on Thursday in the Western and Central provinces.
   The United National Party won 87 of the 158 seats at stake while
a three-party communist alliance won 60 seats. The Sri Lanka Moslem
Congress clinched nine seats and two members of the Liberal Party
were also elected, the election department announced.
   The polling was marred by violence blamed on the People's
Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese group.
   At least six people, including two policemen, were killed on
Wednesday and Thursday as the front launched a wave of arson and
bombings in an attempt to disrupt voting.
   Members of the front burnt 15 government buildings, two trains
and at least six buses in the Western and Central Provinces where
polling was held, officials said.
   On Thursday, polling booths were attacked by Sinhalese radicals
with bombs and grenades, police officers in Colombo said. The
officers spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The front opposes the plan to elect provincial councils in the
nine provinces in the country, saying it gives too many
concessisons to Tamils.
   The plan is aimed at giving the minority Tamil community, which
makes up a majority of the population in the Northern and Eastern
provinces, more say in local government to quell their five-year
separtist war.
   Four of the country's provinces went to the polls on April 28 in
elections that were also won by the United National Party.
   The Southern province is to elect council members next week but
polls in the Northern and Eastern provinces have been posponed
indefinitely because Tamil rebels have renounced the peace plan and
are continuing their violent agitation for an independent homeland.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. The
rebels claim that their community is discriminated against by the
Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population and control
the government and military.
   Thursday's polls were also marked by opposition allegations of
rigging. Rajiva Wijesiwha, president of the Liberal Party, said
members of the governing party impersonated voters after driving
opposition representatives out of polling booths.
   Election Commissioner Chandrananda De Silva said the charges
were being investigated. He said 1.5 million of the 3.6 million
eligible voters participated in the polls.
   The turn-out is considered low when compared to past elections
in Sri Lanka. A Liberation Front threat to shoot voters is believed
to be the cause of the low turnout.

   The Air Force says two of its facilities
within the United States and three overseas structures have
unacceptably high levels of natural radioactive radon gas.
   The service said in a statement issued Thursday that the high
readings turned up at its academy and Peterson Air Force Base near
Colorado Springs, Colo. and at Andersen Air Base on the island of
Guam in a new testing program.
   The Air Force would not identify the other two bases outside the
country until it had notified the host country's government.
   The service said it is launching a more extensive radon testing
program and that it would take ``quick corrective action'' at the
facilities where the high gas levels have been found.
   Radon is a colorless, odorless natural product of decaying
uranium in the soil. Medical research has indicated that exposure
to high levels of radon over extended periods may increase the risk
of lung cancer.

   Freddy Partin of Williamstown was charged with second-degree

   Police said Freddy rode the bike to a nearby service station
after the shooting Wednesday, borrowed a quarter from the cashier
and called his mother, Nannie Jane Partin, to tell her what
happened.
   ``There's no rhyme or reason here,'' said state police Trooper
Jim Dolwick. ``One brother winds up killing the other over
something as trivial as a bicycle. How do you explain that?''
   The two boys were at home alone in the living room of the small
frame house rented by their mother when the shooting occurred,
police said. It was not immediately clear who owned the gun.
   Both boys attended Williamstown Elementary School, where classes
ended two weeks ago for the summer.
   Janis Fox, supervisor of instruction for the Williamstown
schools, said Ms. Partin, who is a single parent and employed at a
fast-food restaurant, ``worked a lot and I'm sure the boys were
left alone a lot because of that.''
   She said neither of the younger brothers was a discipline
problem in school, but Freddy ``is a child who had to learn to
control his temper.''
   Freddy was charged as a juvenile, and Grant County Attorney Jim
Purcell said the maximum sentence he could receive would be to be
placed in the care of the Kentucky Cabinet for Human Resources
until he is 18.
   The boy was released to the custody of his uncle, Richard Partin.

<HEAD>Indian Film Star Raj Kapoor Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raj Kapoor, India's most famous film
star, has died after a month in the hospital following an asthma
attack, state television reported. He was 64.
   Kapoor, known as ``the Charlie Chaplin of India,'' acted in 60
films and produced or directed 18 others over a career that spanned
four decades. Almost all his movies were hits in India, and he was
perhaps the most popular Indian film actor abroad, with followers
in the Soviet Union, the Middle East and China.
   Among his best-known films was ``Awara'' (The Vagabond), in
which he borrowed from Chaplin and played the part with trousers
riding high above his ankles and a perpetual forlorn look on his
face.
   A semi-biographical film, ``Mera Naam Joker'' (My Name is
Joker), filled 25 reels and allowed the audience two intermissions
in its more than four-hour showing.
   Kapoor, who died Thursday, was stricken on May 2 during a film
awards ceremony at which he was given India's highest movie honor,
the Dada Saheb Phalke Award. He was already in such weakened
physical condition that Indian President Ramaswami Venkataraman had
to come down from the stage to give him the trophy.
   The actor later was carried from the auditorium and hospitalized.
   Kapoor's father, the late Prithvi Raj Kapoor, was a stage and
screen actor and three of Kapoor's sons _ Randhir, Rishi and Rajeev
_ are popular actors. Kapoor's two younger brothers, Shammi and
Shashi, also are screen stars.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi issued a statement mourning the
death, calling Kapoor, ``a person who became a legend in his
lifetime.''
   There was no immediate word of funeral arrangements.

<HEAD>Fast Growing Fish Could Be Boon to Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELISSA CONTI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A genetically altered carp that grows 20
percent faster than natural carp could reduce fish prices and boost
fishing industry revenues, a researcher says.
   However, a critic of genetic engineering warned that havoc could
result if altered carp escape into lakes and streams and upset
nature's balance.
   Two researchers from Johns Hopkins University here and one from
Auburn University in Alabama injected the genes of rainbow trout
into carp eggs to create a fish that grows one-fifth faster than
other carp and consumes more food.
   ``The potential of doing this in other fish could mean billions
of dollars worldwide. If you can get organisms to grow faster and
improve efficiency it will bring down the price to the consumer,''
said one of the researchers, Johns Hopkins biology department
Chairman Dennis Powers.
   The technique could eventually be applied to catfish farming, a
multimillion-dollar-a-year industry for the South, Powers said. In
addition, if continuing tests on the altered carp succeed, genetic
manipulation could increase fish production in winter months, when
fish grow more slowly.
   But genetic engineering critic Jeremy Rifkin said that if the
carp escapes into nature, ``that could dramatically change and
disrupt marine life.''
   If the altered genes are transmitted to other generations ``they
could overtake the environment,'' said Rikfin, a Washington-based
lobbyist who is president of the Foundation on Economic Trends.
   Powers, however, said that because the fish need substantially
more food than normal carp they would likely starve if released
into the environment rather than being raised at a fish farm.
   Powers also said he and his colleagues have to study whether the
altered gene can be passed on to future generations of carp.
   Powers, Johns Hopkins molecular biologist Thomas Chen and Auburn
fisheries geneticist Rex Dunham have asked the U.S. Department of
Agriculture for permission to release the carp into small
experimental ponds at Auburn to see how the fish fare outdoors.
   The fish would be isolated in the holding ponds, and would not
be allowed to escape into lakes and streams in the preliminary
study, Powers said.
   Rifkin said there were not enough assurances the carp would not
escape, and is petitioning USDA to deny the application.
   The researchers injected a growth hormone-producing gene into
the just-fertilized eggs of 10,000 carp, but only 20 carp retained
the trout gene.
   Because of that, Dunham said more experiments would have to be
done before he is sure the experiment succeeded.
   Chinese scientists proved last year that genes from other
animals can change physical and chemical processes in fish.
   Scientists have successfully mixed genes from different species
in warm-blooded animals, such as rodents and livestock, and in
microbes and plants.

   Restrictions on the slaughter of 15,854 sheep in
Britain, imposed after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, have
been lifted because tests show they do not contain unsafe levels of
radiation, the Agriculture Ministry said today.
   Restrictions on the movement and slaughter of 469,000 other
sheep on 757 farms in western Britain and Northern Ireland remain
in effect, said ministry spokeswoman Coral Hill.
   Ms. Hill said that as of Wednesday, the 15,854 sheep which were
in contaminated areas between Sept. 25, 1987, and Jan. 10, 1988, no
longer had to be tested for safe radiation levels before being
slaughtered because of the ``substantial fall in radioactivity
levels.''
   Heavy rain fell in the peaty, sheep-rearing hills of
northwestern England, northern Wales, southwestern Scotland and
parts of Northern Ireland, shortly after the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant explositon in the Soviet Union on April 26, 1986. The
rain carried radioactive fallout.

   Somali rebels have warned the
United States and other foreign governments against trying to
evacuate about 160 foreigners trapped by Somalia's civil war.
   However, the anti-government guerrillas said they would agree to
a U.N.-sponsored removal of the foreigners, who were in parts of
northern Somalia that apparently fell into rebel hands earlier this
week.
   The foreigners, mostly aid workers, include Americans, Britons
and French.
   The British Foreign Office said about 25 Britons were there and
that they were not considered in immediate danger.
   There were reports Thursday that the United States and Britain
intended to remove their nationals. None of the Africa-based
diplomats for both countries contacted by The Associated Press
verified those reports.
   Saeed Yusuf, a rebel spokesman in Addis Ababa, said Thursday his
guerrilla movement would cooperate only with an evacuation
organized by the United Nations.
   ``We reject and warn against any form of intervention against
this just war of liberation,'' Yusuf said. ``We are worried that
this might be an excuse to turn the evacuation into a kind of
intervention. Our troops would have no choice but to stand against
them.''
   The United States is Somalia's most important ally, and Britain
was the former colonial ruler in northern Somalia.
   The rebels claimed they captured the main northern town of
Hargeisa on Tuesday after a nine-hour battle. However, the British
Foreign Office said Somali government officials denied the claim.
   Government officials could not be reached for comment today.
   Yusuf said government troops were trying to regain the town.
   The rebels said they took Berbera, Somalia's main seaport and
the site of a U.S. Navy construction unit, on Wednesday.
   Yusuf said the rebels controlled most of the countryside in the
north and a cluster of small towns in the center of the region.
   He said the foreigners in those areas were safe in their homes.
   ``Any danger is from the side of the government troops who are
engaged in the shelling of towns won by the SNM (rebels),'' he said.

   Insulin-dependent diabetics sustained by kidney
transplants for 10 years or more have a fair chance of being free
of complications normally associated with the disease, surgeons say.
   The paper by surgeons at the University of Minnesota was to be
presented today at the American Society of Transplant Surgeons'
annual meeting.
   Doctors elsewhere said they have succeeded in simultaneously
transplanting tiny kidneys and pancreata from children into
diabetic adults, holding out hope to some of the many diabetics
unable to be cured because of the scarcity of donor organs.
   ``It's very, very important to use all potential donors and
help'' as many diabetics as possible, said Dr. Dai D. Nghiem, a
transplant surgeon at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh.
   According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 11
million Americans suffer from diabetes, a disease caused by the
body's inability to produce or properly use insulin. Insulin, a
hormone produced by the pancreas, is needed to convert sugar,
starches and other food into energy.
   An estimated 1 million people have the more severe form of the
disease and must take daily insulin injections to stay alive.
Complications include heart and kidney disease, blindness, nerve
damage and gangrene that requires limb amputation.
   Of the 264 insulin-dependent diabetics who underwent kidney
transplants at the University of Minnesota more than 10 years ago,
100 were alive a decade after the operation, said one researcher,
Dr. John Najarian.
   A third of the 100 long-term survivors had no diabetes-related
complications, and amputations were necessary in only 20 percent.
   The long-term patients' eyesight and nerve disorders stabilized
in a majority of cases, according to Najarian.
   Kidney disease, present in the transplanted kidney tissue of all
patients, progressed in just half of those who survived a decade,
he said.
   Of the 13,000 people currently awaiting kidney transplants in
the United States, about a third are diabetics with kidney failure,
Najarian said. A transplant would get them off dialysis, but they
still would need insulin shots.
   Some diabetics with kidney failure opt for a pancreas as well as
kidney transplant so they can be free of both insulin and dialysis.
   About 150 people, all of them diabetic, currently are awaiting
pancreas transplants across the country, according to the United
Network for Organ Sharing.
   To help ease the crunch, Nghiem and other surgeons at the
University of Iowa performed seven kidney-pancreas transplants from
1984 to 1986 on diabetic adults with organs from children as young
as 4. The double transplant had never been done before with child
organs, he said.
   Seventeen similar transplants were performed with adult-size
organs during the two-year period.
   One of the patients who received adult organs and one who
received child organs died of diabetes-related complications,
Nghiem said Thursday.
   Nghiem, who's since moved to Pittsburgh, said the use of
child-size organs can help reduce the number of diabetic adults
awaiting transplants. Doctors, however, say the impact may be
minimal because so few children qualify as organ donors.

<HEAD>Most Physicians Favor Withdrawing Life Support for Hopelessly Ill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of U.S. physicians responding to a
survey say they ``favor strongly'' withdrawing life-support systems
from hopelessly ill or irreversibly comatose patients, and most say
they have faced such situations.
   ``Withdrawing treatment sounds harsh, but it can be a a
benevolent act,'' said Dr. Kenneth Vaux, a professor of ethics at
the University of Illinois Medical School in Chicago.
   The survey, conducted by the American Medical Association and
published today, asked doctors: ``Would you favor or oppose
withdrawing life-support systems, including food and water, from
hopelessly ill or irreversibly comatose patients if they or their
families request it?''
   Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed answered ``favor
strongly,'' 20 percent ``favor,'' 5 percent ``oppose,'' 10 percent
``oppose strongly'' and 7 percent ``unsure.''
   One thousand randomly selected physicians in various specialties
responded to the survey, which was published in the AMA weekly,
American Medical News.
   Of those physicians, 67 percent said they have been directly
involved in treating a patient where the issue of refusing or
withdrawing life-sustaining treatment arose.
   ``While physicians should never directly cause death, they must
always act in the best interest of their patients, and that
sometimes includes allowing them to die,'' said Dr. James H.
Sammons, executive vice president of the Chicago-based AMA.
   Dr. James Childress, a medical ethics professor at the
University of Virginia, said he perceived a shift toward
considering cost when deciding whether to continue life-sustaining
treatment.
   ``During the time of the Karen Ann Quinlan case in the
mid-1970s, there was a greater risk of overtreatment. But now with
pressures of cost containment, patients may be in danger of
undertreatment,'' Childress said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   Added Vaux, ``The danger is we'll start to do people in before
they're ready to die.''
   In the case of Miss Quinlan, who became comatose in 1975, the
New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed the individual's right to die
with dignity and permitted authorities to remove a respirator in
1976. She died in 1985.
   The survey also showed 54 percent of the physicians were
uncertain of the legal risks and responsibilities surrounding a
decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, while 43 percent
said they were certain.
   Ninety percent said doctors should initiate discussions with
patients or families on the use or withdrawal of life-support
treatment, while 7 percent said they should not.
   No margin of error was given for the survey.
   Vaux said the survey implies doctors are ``returning to a more
ancient attitude of accompanying the person to the death.''
   ``Being willing to withdraw life support when the patient asks
for it or when no further medical remedies exist _ that's an
expression of fidelity to a patient,'' he said.
   Still, physicians must not always follow a patient's request,
said Dr. Nancy Dickey, a member of the AMA's Council on Ethical and
Judicial Affairs.
   ``If medical science can correct the basic problem so that the
patient returns to a good quality of life, then it might be
inappropriate for a physician to listen to a patient who is asking
him to do nothing,'' she said.
   In a separate survey in February, the AMA polled 1,500 people
selected at random from telephone listings.
   Fifty-six percent said they had told family members their wishes
concerning the use of life-sustaining treatment if they entered a
irreversible coma. Just 15 percent said they had filled out a
living will specifying those wishes.
   The physicians surveyed, also in February, were selected
randomly from the AMA's files of all active U.S. doctors. They
included AMA members and non-members and physicians of both sexes
and various ages.

   Thousands of radical students shouting
anti-American slogans vowed today to march to North Korea next week
to force reunification of the divided Korean peninsula.
   Student leaders at a rally said they would lead the march to the
border truce site of Panmunjom on June 10 to meet with North Korean
students and work to reunify with the communist north.
   ``Let's go and meet the northern people after driving out all
foreign forces,'' a speaker said as students cheered and clapped.
   Speakers repeatedly denounced the United States, claiming that
Washington enforces the partition of the Korean peninsula and rules
the south as a colony. The campus was adorned with giant pictures
of students destroying U.S. flags and routing U.S. troops.
   ``Yankee go home'' and ``Go to Panmunjom,'' the 3,000 students
from various colleges shouted in the rally at Kyonghee University.
   South Korean authorities have warned that the students will not
be allowed to march to the border. The border is heavily
militarized, and off-limits to civilians.
   About 50 students hurling firebombs and shouting anti-American
slogans clashed very briefly with riot police at Dankook University
in Seoul before being driven back by tear gas. But the country was
reported quiet today with peaceful demonstrations on most campuses.
   The South Korean government announced earlier today that it
wanted to open new high-level talks with North Korea on the Olympic
Games and other issues dividing the two nations.
   South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae made the proposal in a
letter addressed to his North Korean counterpart, Lee Gun Mo. The
letter was read by Information Minister Chung Han-mo on radio.
   In other developments, Japanese officials said the United States
has asked the Soviet Union to urge North Korea to exercise
restraint during the Olympic Games this September.
   And authorities at Seoul's Kimpo International Aiport and Korean
Air were on the lookout today for four alleged Japanese radicals,
following a tipoff from American law enforcement officials.
   In the letter, Lee said South Korea wanted to talk to North
Korea to ``speedily dispel the mistrust that is now standing in the
way of peaceful unification.''
   But South Korean officials said North Korea refused to accept
Lee's letter.
   Radical students have been demanding immediate reunfication of
the two Koreas. Student leaders say they want North Korean students
to march to meet them June 10 and destroy the border.
   The radicals contend the United States is reponsible for the
partition of the peninsula since 1945. They have been demanding
withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-government
and anti-U.S. protests during the past three weeks with radical
students fighting riot police in Seoul and other cities.
   Most South Koreans oppose the communist north under the one-man
rule of Kim Il Sung and fear any moves by the north to take over
the south. The north invaded the south in 1950, sparking the Korean
War.
   Most South Koreans are thought to support the U.S. military
presence as a defense against the north.
   But reunification is an emotional issue for all Koreans and has
been increasingly debated in recent months. Reunification tended to
be a taboo subject in the south under past authoritarian
governments, but President Roh Tae-woo has lifted most restrictions
on discussion.
   In Tokyo, meanwhile, Japanese defense officials said the United
States had asked the Soviet Union to urge North Korea to exercise
restraint during the Olympics.
   Japanese defense officials learned of the request from U.S.
Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, who arrived in Japan for a
visit after attending the superpower summit in Moscow.
   Korean Air officials said the FBI told KAL's office in New York
on Thursday that four men linked to an alleged Japanese Red Army
member being held in New York might try to slip into South Korea to
sabotage the Games.
   They said the names of the four men were obtained by the FBI
while interrogating Yu Kikumura, 35, who was arrested April 13 in
New Jersey after police reportedly found three bombs in his car.
   The revolutionary Japanese group is suspected of links with
communist North Korea. South Korea fears the North may stage
terrorist attacks to disrupt the Games.

   Grief-stricken relatives today
undertook the painful task of identifying loved ones among the 57
miners killed in a huge gas explosion deep inside a coal mine. An
18-year-old on his first day at work was among the dead.
   Wives of dead miners burst into tears as they watched bodies
being retrieved from the coal shaft grave and taken in metal
coffins to a temporary mortuary.
   ``Many of these people were very active in our community. This
catastrophe is an enormous loss for all of us,'' said Bernd
Hessler, mayor of Borken, a town of 14,000 people 70 miles
northeast of Frankfurt.
   Flags flew at half-staff in front of Borken's city hall.
   Rescue workers continued to remove the bodies from the mine
today, and officials said the 23rd body was brought up by
mid-morning. Officials said work was progressing slowly and could
take several days.
   Crowds of grieving relatives were gathered at the site.
   ``Stop, stop, my God,'' one woman shouted at news photographers
taking pictures of the bodies being removed.
   Investigators said today they were learning more about what
killed the victims.
   ``Several of those found had such great injuries that they could
have died from those causes anyway, even without the carbon
monoxide,'' said Stefan Walscher, the local prosecutor leading the
investigation.
   Investigators also said many of the miners suffocated. Some
apparently died after their emergency breathing masks ran out of
oxygen deep underground.
   Ernst Wilke, head of Hesse state's district of Kassel, told
reporters: ``The search is being continued in every corner (of the
mine).''
   Workers were drilling two new emergency shafts to let more air
into the mine to aid rescuers retrieving bodies.
   Fifty-seven miners were trapped 330 feet underground after
Wednesday's explosion, and rescue workers say there is little hope
any will be found alive.
   Grieving families boarded buses at the mine site and were driven
to a school auditorium where the bodies were also taken.
   Among those killed in West Germany's worst mining accident in
more than 26 years was an 18-year-old on his first day at work.
   ``He'd graduated from school last Friday and wanted to earn some
money before continuing his education,'' Hessler told reporters.
   The mayor declined repeatedly to give the youth's name, out of
respect for his parents' wishes.
   At least 14 of the men trapped were Turkish immigrant workers.
   A group of Turkish women, their heads covered with white shawls
in the Moslem sign of mourning, broke into piercing wails outside
the mine gate to show their grief Thursday afternoon.
   A local official from the Social Democratic Party and the
chairman of the local Turkish-German friendship society, a Turk,
were among the missing, Mayor Hessler said.
   About 300 Turks live in Borken.
   A Hesse state official said the cause of the blast had still not
been determined, but he rejected any contention that safety
measures at the facility were inadequate.
   ``This is one of the most modern and best-equipped lignite coal
mines around,'' said Erwin Braun, head of the state mining board.
``And it has been inspected many times, including recently.''
   ZDF television network said investigators were speculating that
a short-circuit from a tool may have started a chain-reaction of
explosions inside the gas- and dust-filled mine.
   Braun said that possibility could not be discounted.
   ``Coal dust can become dangerous if it gets mixed with methane
gas and there is suddenly a spark,'' he said.
   Officials said that on a still-undetermined day next week there
will be three religious services for the victims: Roman Catholic,
Lutheran and Moslem.
   Turkish consulate representatives also were at the disaster
scene on Thursday.
   The officials, asking not to be identified by name, said some of
the Turks will be taken back to their native country for burial.
   In an interview on Hesse state radio, Governor Wallman promised
that family members of the 14 Turks killed in the accident will be
allowed to stay in West Germany if they choose to do so.
   Normally, when an immigrant worker in West Germany dies or loses
his job, the family must return home, except in cases involving
people from the European Economic Community.
   About 170 people had been employed at the coal mine owned by
Preussen Elektra of Hanover, one of the largest West German utility
companies.

<HEAD>Schlueter Ready To Present New Minority Coalition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acting Prime Minister Poul Schlueter
was reported to be close to an agreement today on a new coalition
government, ending a six-week political impasse that began with a
dispute over Denmark's links with NATO.
   Schlueter was expected to present his minority cabinet to Queen
Margrethe II later today, the conservative Berlingske Tidende
newspaper said.
   The cabinet would be made up of Schlueter's Conservative Party,
Liberals and Social-Liberals.
   The tripartite coalition would command 67 seats in the
179-member Folketing (parliament), compared with the 70 mustered by
the outgoing four-party group that has governed Denmark since 1982.
   Niels Helveg Petersen, leader of the Social-Liberals, said on
Danish radio that he had won ``crucial concessions'' on security
policy during talks with Schlueter and Liberal leader Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen.
   Petersen's small centrist party, which held the balance of power
in the outgoing parliament, helped topple Schlueter's minority
government over the nuclear arms issue.
   The Folketing passed an opposition-sponsored resolution April 14
calling on the government to remind visiting warships of Denmark's
longstanding peacetime ban on nuclear weapons.
   Following strong objections to the resolution by Denmark's NATO
allies, Schlueter called a snap election for May 10 rather than
implement the resolution.
   The ballot was inclusive, and a stalemate emerged between the
eight parties which won seats.
   The coalition agreement hammered out between Schlueter, Petersen
and Ellemann-Jensen, who is acting foreign minister, was not made
public.
   In the new cabinet Schlueter and Ellemann-Jensen would retain
their posts, as would Finance Minister Palle Simonsen. Petersen
would be appointed economic affairs minister, Berlingske Tidende
predicted.
   The leftist opposition, comprising Social Democrats and the
Socialist People's party, together have 79 seats.
   The rar-right Progress party, which made the biggest gains in
the election, has 16 seats. But it was excluded from coalition
talks because its anti-tax and anti-immigration policies are far
outside Denmark's mainstream politics.
   In order to make room for the Social-Liberals, Schlueter shed
the two junior partners from his previous coalition, the nine-seat
Center Democrat and the four-seat Christian People's parties.

   This year's valedictorian at
Bellefontaine High School is Elizabeth Hendershod _ and 13 others
who finished the academic year with perfect grades.
   The 14, who racked up 4.0 grade-point averages in their senior
year at the western Ohio high school, will be honored Sunday when
the school awards diplomas Sunday to its graduating class of 185.
   ``This is indeed a unique situation,'' said schools
Superintendent Robert W. Carter. ``I've never seen anything like in
all my 33 years in education.''
   ``It makes us look like we're grading on a very easy kind of
basis,'' said the school's principal, George Harris. ``But these
are the same standards that we've always had. This is an extremely
unusual group of kids who just happen to be in the same class.''
   Tammy Watson, a valedictorian and class secretary, credited
``tremendous unity'' within the class for the high success rate.
``We work together and help each other to reach higher goals.''
   Hendershod said intense competition was involved.
   ``The fact that there were 13 other candidates helped to
motivate us,'' she said. ``We would say to ourselves, `I'm not
gonna allow that other person to get it and leave me out. If that
person can get it, I can too.' ''

<NOTE>Eds: Top 4 grafs new to show Reagan, Takeshita meeting beginning;

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan gave Japanese Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshite a personal briefing today on the Moscow summit,
another sign that U.S.-Japanese relations had improved despite
long-simmering trade disputes.
   Reagan, posing for pictures with Takeshita, was asked if trade
was on the agenda for the meeting. It ``could be,'' he replied.
   When reporters persisted in questioning Reagan, mostly about his
summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the president
responded, ``We have to go to work. Why don't you take the rest of
the day off?''
   The two then went into Winfield House, the residence of the U.S.
ambassador, for talks.
   Before leaving Tokyo, Takeshita ruled out the possibility that
contentious trade issues would come up during the discussion. But
on Thursday, Reagan administration officials went out of there way
to praise Japan for the progress the country has made in opening up
its markets and boosting domestic demand.
   For more than two years, the administration has been pressuring
the Japanese to adopt policies that will stimulate domestic demand
instead of relying on export-led growth.
   Domestic demand has accelerated in Japan this year, helping to
push the nation's jobless rate down to 2.6 percent in April.
   Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, said
Thursday that Japan had done a remarkable job of modifying its
economic policies in the past year.
   ``I can't see how you could be unhappy with the very sharp
acceleration in domestic demand. I think everyone has been very
pleasantly surprised at what has happened over there in the past
year on that front,'' he said in an interview with reporters.
   Sprinkel said the administration would continue to push for
further progress by the Japanese in opening their markets to
foreign goods.
   ``The important point is that the direction of change is highly
favorable,'' he said. ``They have made major progress in
deregulating their financial system, but there are still some areas
where we think further progress is needed.''
   U.S. and Japanese officials spent three days in Washington this
week locked in disagreement on one of those issues, a prolonged
dispute between the two countries over opening Japanese markets to
more imports of American beef and oranges.
   The discussions between Assistant U.S. Trade Representative
Michael Smith and Japanese Deputy Agriculture Minister Hidero Maki
ended Thursday with no agreement in sight. The Japanese are hoping
to reach a settlement of the dispute before the Toronto economic
summit begins on June 19, but the American side is less certain the
differences can be bridged by that time.
   The United States has been demanding total removal of the beef
and citrus import quotas that it had accepted in a 1984 agreement
that expired in March.
   Part of reason for the easing of tensions between the two
nations has been favorable news on the American trade deficit. It
fell to a three-year low of $9.7 billion in March, bolstering the
president's hand in his current fight with Congress over the
omnibus trade bill.
   Reagan's veto of the measure is expected to be upheld by the
Senate, an event that would be viewed favorably by the Japanese,
who felt singled out by the measure. One Japanese politician
branded it ``racially discriminatory.''
   The reason much of Congress' ire has been focused on Japan is
that the country has accounted for a large share of the deficit,
which hit a record $171.2 billion last year. Over one-third of that
amount, $59.8 billion, reflected the imbalance with Japan.
   But the dollar's 50 percent depreciation versus the Japanese yen
appears to be making headway finally in lowering the deficit,
although analysts remain cautious in predicting major improvements.
   David Wyss, economist with Data Resources Inc., said the U.S.
trade deficit would likely fall by about 10 percent this year to
around $155 billion, but he said much of that improvement would
occur because of a pickup in sales to European countries, not Japan.
   ``The problem is that to a large extent we just don't make the
kinds of goods that the Japanese want to buy and a lot of areas
where we can compete, such as agriculture, are politically very
sensitive within Japan,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Maureen O'Connor is cruising to election
day next week in a mayoral contest that the news media in the
nation's seventh-largest city have virtually ignored because even
insiders find it dull.
   ``To even say the race has been boring is too generous _ it
hasn't been that exciting,'' political consultant Nick Johnson
said. ``It seems like Maureen O'Connor is on a perpetual honeymoon
and the rest of San Diego is on the Love Boat.''
   O'Connor, who won the seat in a special 1986 race called after
former Mayor Roger Hedgecock's felony conviction, has been an
overwhelming favorite in Tuesday's non-partisan primary since the
race's outset.
   She has waged a low-key, low-budget campaign against City
Councilman Floyd Morrow and three minor candidates: semi-retired
public relations official John Kelley, City Hall gadfly Rose Lynne
and businessman Charles Ulmschneider.
   The race _ the city's fourth mayoral contest in five years _ has
drawn only cursory attention from the city's 875,000 residents and
its news media.
   Radio ads have been scarce and television commercials rarer. A
series of debates that marked recent mayoral campaigns fell flat
this year when O'Connor refused to participate.
   The candidates' only major joint appearance will be a one-hour
debate to be broadcast on local television Saturday night.
   ``There wasn't a need for a lot of (debates) because we've all
run for office before and the public already knows who we are and
where we stand,'' said O'Connor, the city's first female mayor.
``This is kind of like a reunion.''
   By race's end, the candidates' combined expenditures may barely
top $100,000.
   O'Connor had spent only $48,839 by May 21, about $220,000 less
than she spent gaining the seat in 1986. In her unsuccessful 1983
bid, O'Connor _ wife of Robert O. Peterson, founder of Jack in the
Box restaurants _ spent $780,000 and was accused of trying to buy
the election.
   O'Connor, 41, maintains that her somnolent campaign is in
keeping with San Diegans' attitude toward the contest.
   ``We've had so many mayor's races lately that most people are
just tired of it,'' she said.
   But Morrow, a 55-year-old lawyer who finished third in the 1986
race behind O'Connor and City Councilman Bill Cleator, has accused
O'Connor of behaving like royalty, not an elected official.
   ``Local government is supposed to be the level of government
closest to the people, but you couldn't prove that by Maureen,''
said Morrow, who says the mayor views the campaign ``more like a
coronation than an election.''
   There are few differences between O'Connor and Morrow _ both
Democrats _ on most citywide issues.
   Recent polls indicated O'Connor has a 2-1 lead over Morrow. She
needs to win more than 50 percent of the vote to forgo a November
runoff. Should she receive less, the top two finishers will face
each other in November.
   O'Connor says she has restored stability to City Hall after
Hedgecock's forced resignation and other scandals, enhanced the
average citizen's access to the mayor's office and strengthened
growth-management policies.
   Hedgecock was forced to resign from his four-year term after he
was convicted of perjury and conspiracy stemming from allegations
that he plotted with political backers to illegally finance his
1983 mayoral campaign.

   President Reagan, after being asked several times
this week why he seemed tired, turned the tables on reporters in
London today, suggesting that his interrogators ``take the rest of
the day off.''
   Reagan, who seemed fatigued and who walked with an apparent limp
on occasion during his five-day summit with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, was barraged with questions while posing for pictures
with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   The rapid-fire questioning came toward the end of a week in
which Reagan was asked whether he was tired and whether he was
sleeping well.
   Reagan said ``I wasn't tired,'' and White House chief of staff
Howard Baker said ``we're all tired.''
   So today, when Reagan was commencing his talks with Takeshita,
the president interrupted reporters, saying:
   ``We have to go to work. Why don't you take the rest of the day
off?''

   Dresses which graced royal occasions between the
two world wars were snapped up on Thursday led by a Japanese museum
which paid up to five times the estimated value for some items.
   Auctioneers Phillips said the Fashion Foundation Museum of Tokyo
bought the eight best lots among the 600 dresses.
   The museum paid $6,120 for a Coco Chanel brown chiffon dress and
$3,660 for a 1920s black silk dress by Madeleine Vionnet.
   Molineux, Worth and Lanvin were among the designer labels on the
dresses, many of which had been worn by ladies-in-waiting at
Buckingham Palace. They were passed on to Ellen Wallis who ran a
discreet second-hand dress service.
   When her business closed in 1937, Mrs. Wallis left the dresses
to her daughter, Robina. After Robina's death last year, the
dresses were found in crates in the stables of her manor house in
Cornwall.
   ``What was found was a time-capsule of superb French haute
couture,'' said Phillips's costume specialist, Anne-Marie Benson.
   The auction totaled nearly $94,000.

   Iran's new acting commander-in-chief
today told Iranians they must take the war with Iraq more seriously
following recent battle defeats.
   Addressing a Moslem prayer congregation in Tehran, Hashemi
Rafsanjani said there should be ``no compromise, no submission, and
no backing down from our rights'' in the war, the Islamic Republic
News Agency said.
   ``We should take the situation more seriously,'' Rafsanjani told
the worshipers.
   Iran has suffered two recent major defeats at the war front.
   Iraqi forces on April 18 retook the southern Iraqi Faw
peninsula, which had been captured by Iran in February 1986. Then
on May 25, Iraqi troops retook arge chunks of Iraqi land east of
Basra.
   The twin defeats for Iran, along with a series of naval clashes
with the United States in mid-April, apparently have jolted the
Tehran rulers into making the leadership changes.
   The official news agency referred to the 53-year-old politician
as the ``temporary speaker'' of parliament. He was elected
temporary speaker during a parliament session May 29.
   According to parliamentary rules, a permanent speaker cannot be
chosen until the credentials of new deputies to the parliament have
been approved, a process which has not been completed following
recent elections.
   The agency reported that Rafsanjani sent a cable to the
87-year-old Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini thanking the patriarch for
appointing him acting commander-in-chief on Thursday.
   In his cable to Khomeini, Rafsanjani expressed hope that he
would succeed in carrying out his new duties ``with divine
dispensations and through the all-out cooperation of the people and
the armed forces,'' the news agency reported.

   A searing heat wave in northern India
has left nearly 400 people dead in the past six days, the United
News of India reported.
   The temperature in parts of Punjab state exceeded 113 degrees.
New Delhi registered a high of 111 degrees.
   An effort to invoke rain through a Hindu fire ritual, called a
yagna, apparently failed, the news agency said Thursday.
   The yagna was performed last week in the town of Mathura in
Uttar Pradesh state, with meteorologists allowed to monitor
potential weather changes, UNI said.
   The scientists reported Thursday that despite the sacred flames,
no rain has fallen on Mathura or surrounding areas.
   The desert state of Rajasthan continued to be hardest hit, with
45 more people dead Thursday of sunstroke and other heat-related
illnesses, the news agency said.
   Since the heat wave began last week, 336 deaths have been
reported in the state. The total includes 15 in Madhya Pradesh
state, 11 in Orissa, six in Uttar Pradesh state and two in
Maharashtra, UNI said.
   At least 27 deaths have been reported in New Delhi. The United
News of India said that 40 people were hospitalized Thursday with
heat-related problems.

<TEXT>
   Nine inmates accused of participating in
a prison riot last month have sued the state, claiming they are
being held improperly at Oklahoma's maximum-security prison and are
forced to live in unsanitary conditions.
   The suit, filed by mail this week, claims the inmates have been
``forced to wear nothing but their underwear'' since arriving at
the Oklahoma State Penitentiary here.
   Shortly after the riot last month, corrections officials said
inmates believed to be directly involved in the uprising were being
clothed only in underwear for security reasons. Spokesman Jerry
Massie said Thursday he was not certain if the inmates had been
given clothes since.
   The nine are being held at the McAlester prison with about 40
inmates accused of involvement in the three-day riot at the
medium-security Mack Alford Correctional Center in Stringtown.
   Sixteen other convicts accused of involvement in the riot, which
ended May 16, pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges during initial
appearances in Atoka County.
   Preliminary hearings in the riot cases are set to begin next
Tuesday at the Atoka County Courthouse. Prosecutors said their
investigation is continuing and more charges could be filed.
   In the lawsuit filed through the mail this week in McAlester,
inmate Brad Allen Smith claims the convicts are not allowed to wear
anything but underwear while being held in the special cells at the
McAlester prison unit called ``the rock.''
   The unit was closed by a federal court order in the early 1980s,
but was reopened after the riot. Most of the inmates in the unit
are accused of being the ringleaders or main participants in the
uprising, authorities said.
   Smith alleges the inmates are being forced to live in dirty,
unhealthy conditions and are denied the right to exercise and to
use the prison law library.
   He also claims inmates have not been allowed to shower and have
been denied clean underwear and basic hygiene items. The suit
claims the cells have no electricity or ventilation systems.
   Other inmates allege in the suit that prison officials did not
follow proper Department of Corrections policies in placing them in
the special unit.
   Another 400 inmates from Mack Alford who authorities said did
not participate in the riot are housed in the East and West units
at the state prison here, which were reopened after court-ordered
closings to accomodate the large influx of inmates.
   Two inmates in those units also filed a lawsuit claiming their
rights have been violated. They allege their living conditions are
substandard, that raw sewage leaks into their cells and that they
are not allowed to exercise or use the law library.

   An 18-year-old woman walked into the city
police station and handed over a bag containing 87 vials of crack,
saying she was tired of dealing drugs and wanted to turn herself in.
   Rosezine Jones, charged with possession of the potent form of
cocaine and possession with intent to distribute, did not enter a
plea during her arraignment Thursday, said municipal court clerk
Princess Reaves.
   A plea will be entered at a probable cause hearing scheduled
June 14, Ms. Reaves said. Ms. Jones did not yet have an attorney
and was returned to Passaic County Jail, where she has been held on
$35,000 bail since her arrest Wednesday morning, Ms. Reaves said.
   Detective Andrew Murray said Ms. Jones, who is less than 5 feet
tall and weighs barely 100 pounds, told him she operated alone,
traveling to Harlem in New York City a few times a week to purchase
crack.
   She sold it around Paterson, including at a playground two
blocks from a parochial school, police said.
   ``She just said she didn't want to do it anymore,'' Murray said.
   He added he didn't think Ms. Jones told police the whole story.
   ``I don't think she could get away with doing that,'' he said.
``I'm pretty sure she was working for someone.''
   Police also speculated she may have taken the drug from someone
and turned herself in out of fear for her safety.
   The crack she turned over to police has an estimated street
value of $1,600, Murray said.
   Regardless of why Ms. Jones acted, Murray said, he does not
expect others to follow her lead.
   ``There's a lot of money to be made,'' he said. ``They're not
giving themselves up.''

<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old student was suspended for
tossing condoms into a junior high school talent-show audience,
saying he wanted to encourage safe sex.
   The parents of James A. Dowdy have filed a lawsuit seeking their
son's reinstatement.
   John H. Bothwell III, attorney for Cindy and Andy Jablonsky,
filed the suit Wednesday. He said he reached a tentative agreement
later that day with Hillsborough County School Board attorney W.
Crosby Few to drop the suit if school officials provide Dowdy with
study materials and set up an appointment with the parents.
   The parents are seeking a court order to end the suspension
imposed last month in favor of some other punishment, contending
that James might have to repeat ninth grade if he is not allowed to
return to Adams Junior High School to prepare for final exams.
   If the suspension stands and James fails ninth grade, he would
be ``irreparably harmed'' and would experience trauma,
embarrassment, anguish and stigma, the lawsuit said.
   James and three other Adams students, Josh Banks, 13, James
Noble, 14, and Gabe Freedman, 15, were suspended after they
distributed the condoms at the end of a May 17 talent show in the
school cafeteria.
   The boys said they wanted to encourage safe sex.
   The suspensions began May 20 and are to continue until Monday.
   The Jablonskys contend that they have tried without success to
persuade school officials to impose sanctions other than removing
their son from school at a ``critical time.''
   Andy Jablonsky, James' stepfather, attended a May 24 School
Board meeting and said Principal Ken Adum incorrectly told the
board the students had been warned not to disrupt the show.
   Bothwell said James was not among the students who received the
admonishment.
   A copy of a May 20 letter from school officials to the
Jablonskys was attached to the suit.
   The letter lists ``distribution of condoms to students'' and
``disruption of a school function with a vulgar and obscene act''
as reasons for the suspension.

<HEAD>First Chinese Auction of Antiques Finds Few Bidders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beijing's first large-scale auction of antiques
ended Friday with overpriced items going once, going twice and gone
back to the warehouse.
   Of 33 antiques valued at $270,000 put on sale, only three of the
cheapest items, bought by a Japanese businessman and his friends
for $2,168, were bid on.
   ``We'd buy if the prices were reasonable,'' said a Hong Kong
businessman who left before the show ended. ``But the prices are
way too high. They don't know how to auction. They're starting far
too high.''
   More than 400 people, including about 40 foreigners, attended
the auction sponsored by the Beijing Auction Market, a state-run
organization obtaining most of its goods from antique stores.
   The auction market debuted last month with a little-publicized
sale of less expensive items that garnered $27,400.
   Today's auction, which the sponsors said was the capital's first
large-scale official sale of antiques, attracted more attention,
bringing in diplomats, foreign businessmen and their spouses
looking for bargains.
   The only bargain was the entry fee, a modest $2.70.
   Many of the most expensive items were antique copies of older
pieces, such as a 17th century reproduction of a Song Dynasty
(960-1126) scroll which had a starting bid price of $81,000.
   An original 19th century scroll with a starting price of $27,000
was ignored by bidders, as were several vases and bowls going for
$8,100 and up.
   The Japanese businessman finally broke the no-bid ice on the
17th item when he paid $622 for the cheapest item on the list, a
pottery figure dating back to the Sui Dynasty (581-618).
   ``I thought it was worth it because it is so old,'' he said.
``Most of the things here are too expensive.''
   The businessman and his companions also purchased a Song Dynasty
bowl for $868 and a Tang Dynasty (618-907) bronze mirror for $678.
   Most of the Chinese in the audience were reporters and their
friends. The average Chinese worker earns a little more than $270 a
year, and all purchases had to be paid for in foreign exchange
certificates, a currency used for foreign transactions which few
Chinese have access to.
   The Beijing Auction Market is the fifth to open in China. The
official media has praised the markets as another means to speed up

   An open letter by an Iranian opposition politician
that criticizes the policies of leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
has led to numerous arrests in Iran, according to reports reaching
Paris.
   It was not immediately known if Mehdi Bazargan, author of the
letter and head of the tiny Freedom Movement, Iran's only legal
opposition group, was among those in jail.
   In the letter, Bazargan accused Khomeini of following an
``erroneous policy'' in the war with Iraq, isolating Iran and
making it a symbol of hate around the world. Excerpts from the
letter were printed in today's edition of Le Monde newspaper.
   An Iranian exile source in Paris, who obtained a copy of the
letter, said Thursday it was 33 pages long and distributed in
numerous Iranian cities about 10 days ago.
   Another, shorter letter by a group sympathizing with Bazargan
also was distributed in Iran, the source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The letters and the subsequent arrests came on the heels of
several major Iranian defeats in its war with Iraq. In mid-April,
Iraq recaptured the Faw Peninsula from Iran. In late May, Iran lost
its bridgehead in the southern Iraqi port city of Basra following
an Iraqi assault.
   Bazargan also denounced aid allegedly furnished by Iran to
terrorist groups such as the Islamic Jihad, which claims to be
holding Western hostages in Lebanon.
   ``In truth, for seven years Iran and Islam have become
synonymous in the world with hate and malice,'' Le Monde quoted the
letter as saying. ``It is a shame and not an honor.''
   ``When are you going to stop making commerce with the blood of
our martyrs?''
   Bazargan, an opposition politician under former Shah Mohammed
Reza Pahlavi, was appointed prime minister shortly after Khomeini's
return from exile. He stepped down in mid-November 1979, objecting
to Khomeini's support for the detention of American hostages.
Bazargan also served in the nation's parliament.
   Le Monde said it appeared that several dozen people were
arrested in Tehran, the Iranian capital, and provincial cities such
as Tabriz, in Azerbaijan, and Isfahan, south of the capital.
   Among those arrested, Le Monde said, were Ali Ardalan, former
finance minister; and Husseini Shah Hussein, who was president of
the welcome committee when the exiled Khomeini returned to Iran in
1980.
   Police forces this week occupied the Tehran headquarters of the
Freedom Movement, making more arrests, according to Le Monde, which
did not give sources for the report. It said they were apparently
searching for Bazargan but did not say whether he was among those
arrested.
   ``Yesterday at 2 a.m., they went to his place, but we don't know
yet if he was arrested or not,'' said Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, exiled
first president of the post-Shah Islamic Republic, in a telephone
interview on Thursday. Bani-Sadr now lives outside Paris.
   In the letter, Le Monde quoted Bazargan as saying that none of
Iran's war goals had been achieved and that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, whom Iran has vowed to topple, remains in place.
   ``You have, besides, proclaimed the continuation of the war
until the destruction of Israel, but you have arrived at a policy
of compromise and collaboration with Israel,'' an apparent
reference to the Iran-Contra imbroglio in which Israel reportedly
acted as a conduit for U.S. arms sales to Iran.
   ``You have denounced the policies of the United States and now
the latter are solidly installed at our door in the Persian Gulf.
You spoke of the failure of Iraq and the bursting of its regime,
but with your erroneous policy, Iraq has reinforced itself ... and
it is we who are on the edge of bankruptcy.''
   Bazargan has in the past called for an end to the Iran-Iraq war,
now in its eighth year, but observers described the letter as his
strongest such protest.
   For the first time, he denounced alleged Iranian ties to
terrorist groups. Naming the Islamic Jihad, he wrote that ``by its
terrorist action, it has filled the world with hate toward our
country.
   ``You have thus isolated the Islamic Republic, and the youth who
made our revolution are today traumatized, repressed and
desperate.''
   On Thursday, Khomeini appointed Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani acting commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, Iran's
official media reported.
   Bani-Sadr said Rafsanjani was appointed because the Iranian
goverment fears it may lose the war.

   Palestinian protesters virtually shut down the
occupied territories today in a general strike viewed as a test of
the six-month Arab uprising. One Palestinian was shot and killed
and seven were injured during demonstrations in the West Bank.
   The army put 190,000 Palestinians under restrictions to prevent
violence on the opening day of the three-day strike called to
protest a new Middle East visit by Secretary of State George P.
Shultz. A leaflet calling for the strike said Shultz was trying to
quell the uprising.
   Shultz returns to the Middle East today for the fourth time in
five months to win support for a U.S. plan that calls for an
international conference to launch peace talks.
   In the West Bank village of Shuykh, Israeli soldiers fatally
shot 20-year-old Mustafa Ahmed Halaika in the chest, officials at
the Alia Hospital in nearby Hebron said.
   They said two other Arabs were wounded in the legs or arms, and
four suffered beating injuries or the effects of tear gas when a
protest broke out in the village.
   Hospital officials also said that a 15-year-old Palestinian was
wounded in his left arm during clashes with Israeli soldiers in the
nearby village of Siir.
   The army command said it was checking the reports. One military
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said reports from
the village said Halaika was killed by civilians, but the reason
for his death was not clear.
   In Jerusalem's walled Old City, a group of youths demonstrated
on the sacred Temple Mount after today's Moslem prayers, raising
the outlawed Palestinian flag, police said.
   In the Gaza Strip, nearly all shops were closed, public transit
was shut down, and streets were still. Similar reports came from
cities and towns in the West Bank.
   In Bethlehem on the West Bank, outlawed Palestinian flags flew
from electricity poles, and normally crowded Manger Square was
deserted.
   ``Observe the strike, or we are going to burn,'' read a slogan
painted on a wall.
   Few of the 110,000 Palestinians who work in Israel reported to
their jobs, according to Arab and Israeli media reports.
   Today's strike contrasted sharply with one on Monday, when
thousands of Arab workers defied orders issued in a leaflet from
the underground United National Leadership of the Uprising.
   Monday's strike supported Israeli officials' view that the
uprising was waning, and political analysts said the new three-day
protest would be a test for the uprising.
   ``This is very important for the image of the leadership'' said
Clinton Bailey, an Arab affairs expert at Tel Aviv University.
   Saib Erakat, a Palestinian political science professor,
predicted full compliance. ``The Israelis have been saying since
December that the uprising is dying down,'' said Erakat, who
teaches at the West Bank's An-Najah University.
   He said Monday's partial failure came from confusion over dates,
not fatigue among Palestinians.
   In addition to Shultz's visit, the strike call also coincides
with the sixth anniversary of Israel's invasion of Lebanon on
Monday, and Sunday's 21st anniversary of the 1967 Middle East war
in which Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip from its Arab
neighbors.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in remarks broadcast today by
the army radio that he saw signs the uprising was waning, but he
added:
   ``Unfortunately, there are also things that prevent this from
happening, including all kinds of undesirable intervention by Jews
and Israelis.''
   Curfews were clamped today on the Shati and Jabaliya refugee
camps in Gaza and the towns of Shuweika, Jamain and Qalqiliya in
the West Bank, an army spokesman said. Eight other areas were
declared closed, preventing people from coming and going.
   Nearly 170,000 people in the Gaza Strip and another 20,000 in
the West Bank were affected by the restrictions.
   According to U.N. figures, 199 Palestinians have been killed in
the uprising. Two Israelis also have died.
   The army on Thursday retracted figures it released earlier this
week which put the Arab death toll at 207. The army said it had
changed how it compiles the deaths, and spokesman Col. Raanan
Gissin said the army was certain of only 152 deaths, all at the
hands of soldiers.

   An elevated train bumped into another train on
the city's South Side today, sending at least 20 people to
hospitals for treatment of minor injuries, authorities said.
   The train was traveling about 5 mph when it hit a work train
carrying five Chicago Transit Authority repairmen, supervisor Joe
Daquilante said.
   Electric power was temporarily cut so rescue crews could get to
the trains, but traffic resumed shortly after the incident,
Daquilante said.
   Three hospitals reported 20 people in their emergency rooms.
   ``They had whiplash, just minor stuff,'' said Nellie Davis, a
nursing supervisor at Chicago Osteopathic Medical Center, where 12
people were checked and released.
   Another half dozen were treated and released at Holy Cross
Hospital, and Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center was
treating two people with neck and back pain.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Horace A. Hildreth, who also
served as U.S. ambassador to Pakistan and president of Bucknell
University, has died. He was 85.
   Hildreth suffered a fatal heart attack Thursday at Maine Medical
Center, where he was being examined for a blood pressure problem,
said his son, Horace Jr.
   In Augusta, Gov. John R. McKernan issued a statement saying he
was ``deeply saddened'' by the death of his fellow Republican, who
had served as governor from 1945 to 1949.
   ``The state has lost a great friend, public servant and true
patron. He will be sorely missed,'' McKernan said.
   Hildreth, a lawyer, also was a broadcasting executive. He served
as president of Bucknell from 1949 to 1953 after leading Maine
through reconversion to a peacetime economy following World War II.
   In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower named Hildreth
ambassador to Pakistan, the Moslem country carved out of British
India in 1947.
   Hildreth's two terms as governor included one of the state's
worst economic disasters, a 1947 forest fires that blackened more
than 200,000 acres, killed 16 people and destroyed almost 1,100
homes.
   In 1948, Hildreth tried to win a U.S. Senate seat, but ran
second to Sen. Margaret Chase Smith in a four-way GOP primary
contest. Ten years later he failed in a bid for a third term as
governor.
   A Gardiner native, Hildreth was a graduate of Bowdoin College
and Harvard Law School. He practiced law in Portland and began the
Hildreth Network of Maine radio and television stations before
going into politics in 1940 as a state lawmaker.
   The Hildreth Network included the state's first commercial radio
station, Bangor's WABI. Other stations were WABI-TV in Bangor and
WAGM-TV in Presque Isle.
   In 1977 he and W. Russell Brace of Belfast combined the
broadcasting network with Brace's newspaper and book publishing
interests in a company known as Diversified Communications Inc.
   Hildreth is survived by his wife, the former Katherine Wing, and
four children.

   The owners of a hog farm set up to protest
zoning in downtown Hygiene have decided to call it quits.
   ``We hope to be gone before the snow flies,'' said Jerry Swart,
who managed the hog farm for the owner, Houston Downs. ``We hate
this county so bad, we never wanted to come here in the first
place.''
   Downs wanted to use the property as a covered parking facility
for recreational vehicles and said if his land was not rezoned to
commercial, he would install a hog farm. And he did.
   ``I am not for wall-to-wall growth, but then I am not for
government taking something away without compensation,'' said
Swart. ``That can't be democracy.''
   But nobody really seemed to care if there was a hog farm in the
middle of this small northern Colorado community. In the end, Swart
and Downs lost between $4,000 and $5,000 on the venture.
   ``The only thing we didn't have happen to us was swine
cholera,'' Swart said. ``With that you go out one morning and find
all of them dead.''
   And so, the Hygiene Hog Farm is for sale.

   Here is a transcript of British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's address Friday to the Royal Institute of
International Affairs at Guildhall.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   My Lord Mayor, Mr. President, Your Excellencies, My Lords,
Aldermen, Sheriffs, Ladies and Gentlemen.
   We've been privileged, Mr. President, to hear you deliver this
first report of your historic summit meeting with General Secretary
Gorbachev in Moscow.
   It was an honor for us and fitting that you choose to do so here
in London in this ancient, on honor for us because of our
friendship with United States of America, of friendship which is
indissoluble. And fitting because this city of London and all that
it stands for are part of your heritage as well ours.
   We warmly congratulate you and General Secretary Gorbachev for a
very successful summit, one which will influence the course of
history for years to come. It is the result of months, indeed
years, of hard work by you, by Secretary Shultz and countless
others. And we should like to say thank you to Mrs. Reagan, too,
for the splendid support which she always gives.
   The summit has brought us closer to the more stable relations
between East and West that we all want to see. Indeed, I believe
there is now more hope between East and West than ever before in
the lifetime of most of here.
   It was so characteristic of you, Mr. President, not to flinch
from taking the fight for fundamental human rights to the very
heart of the Soviet Union. Your words in Moscow will have shone
like a beacon of hope for all those wherever they are who are
denied their basic freedoms.
   But as I listened to you, Mr. President, I couldn't help
thinking of your achievements as president, achievements over
nearly eight years which have made possible this summit and so much
else besides.
   Your leadership has made America strong and confident again, and
we in Britain should like to say thank you for being such a staunch
and loyal ally to this country and to Europe.
   I recall what Winston Churchill once wrote, ``Where we are able
to stand together and work together for righteous causes, we shall
always be thankful and the world will always be free.''
   You, Mr. President, have successfully negotiated the first
reductions in nuclear weapons. You changed attitudes and
perceptions about what is possible, the most difficult thing of all
in politics. And you've done it, now by bowing to the wishes and
whims of others, but by standing firm in your own beliefs as we
heard once again today.
   It's as if you had said at the beginning of your life in
politics, ``This I believe, this I act upon. This I will always
believe, this I will always act upon.'' And thank goodness you have.
   From that strong fortress of convictions, you set out to enlarge
freedom the world over. Your personal coverage, your gentle humor
and your spirit of optimism are all part of a special quality which
you have brought to the presidency. Above all, and in this you have
done the greatest possible service not only your own people but to
free people everywhere, you have restored faith in the American
dream, a dream of boundless opportunity, built on enterprise,
individual effort and personal generosity.
   When we compare the mood of confidence and optimism in the West
today with the mood when you took office in 1980 we know that a
greater change has taken place than ever we could have imagined.
Mr. President, you spoke of seeking a newer world. You are doing so
with all the qualities of which Tennyson spoke in that verse,
``Strong in will to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield.''
   My Lord Mayor, I believe everyone present in this Guildhall will
join me in saying, ``Thank you Mr. President. Thank you for the
summit. Thank you for your presidency. Thank you for your testament
of belief. And God bless America.''

<HEAD>Sakharov Says Gorbachev Deserves Benefit Of Doubt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov told
reporters today that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev must be
given the benefit of the doubt to implement his reforms and improve
human rights.
   In a scene that would have been unthinkable in the past,
Sakharov spoke to reporters for almost two hours at the Foreign
Ministry press center.
   Sakharov said the fact that he was appearing at the press center
``reflects a change in the situation in this country and it's not a
matter of me changing my position.''
   One of the Soviet Union's leading physicists, Sakharo was a
founder of the Soviet dissident movement and was confined for
nearly seven years to the closed city of Gorky for his criticism of
the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   ``I believe sizeable changes have taken place of late. Of
course, they are not exhaustive and do not ensure the full
implementation of human rights,'' Sakharov said.
   He said he has ``a lot of apprehensions'' about the future of
Gorbachev's reforms for Soviet society but believes they ultimately
will succeed because they are a historic necessity.
   ``We should give it an advance measure of trust,'' he said. ``An
expression of trust in perestroika at this time would only
encourage it, and improve the human rights situation.''
   Perestroika, which means ``restructuring,'' refers to
Gorbachev's efforts to reform the economy and society.
   Sakharov praised this week's Moscow summit meeting, but said the
Americans and Soviets could have made more progress on nuclear
weapons talks.
   ``The specific results of the summit were not as impressive as
the Washington summit,'' he said.
   Sakharov urged the two sides to work for more progress on a
treaty to halve their long-range nuclear missiles, saying they can
work around their disputes over Reagan's planned Strategic Defense
Initiative _ the ``Star Wars'' space-based nuclear shield _ and
verification.
   ``I am sure that talking about the 50 percent cuts an agreement
is possible even without any connection to the SDI program,'' he
said. Settling of verification problems is possible if the two
sides decide politically to do it, he said.
   Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, bitterly criticized a reporter
for asking whether Sakharov had made an agreement with authorities
not to talk about certain topics at the unusual news conference.
   She said Sakharov held the news conference because reporters in
Moscow for the summit meeting between President Reagan and
Gorbachev had called ``from morning to night,'' asking for
interviews.
   Sakharov, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the
1950s, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his human rights work.
   In January 1980, he was banished to the closed city of Gorky for
criticizing the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan and
remained there until December 1986, when Gorbachev allowed him to
return to Moscow.
   He has since returned to his scientific work and has become
increasingly reluctant to talk to reporters. Instead, he has
expressed his opinions in several letters published in the official
Soviet press.
   He said he was told late last year by President Gury Marchuk of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences that he may not leave the country
because of secret information to which he had access until 1968.
   ``Personally, I believe it's not a matter of my former access to
secret information. It's a matter of confidence in me,'' he said.

   An advertisement for a swank shopping
mall that used the term ``bag lady'' to describe a well-dressed
shopper has been pulled after city officials called it offensive.
   Officials at Newport Centre, a new mall on the Jersey City
waterfront across from Manhattan, apologized and withdrew the
newspaper spots.
   The ads asked, ``What you do call a typical shopper at Newport
Centre?''
   ``Bag Lady,'' is the answer, next to a picture of a woman
dressed to the nines and holding a Newport Centre shopping bag.
   Barbara Willis, a spokeswoman for Newport, said the ad campaign
was developed around the theme of shopping bags, and the reference
to bag lady was ``just one of those things that got by us.''
   She said the shopping center had received several telephone
calls complaining the ads were insensitive to homeless people who
must carry around their belongings in shopping bags.
   Mayor Anthony R. Cucci said: ``Bag lady has a very special
meaning in Jersey City, and it is not this. They should know
better.''
   City Council President Glenn Cunningham said: ``I'm sure it
wasn't meant to be tasteless, but it sure ended up being tasteless.
Housing the homeless is a major problem here.''

<HEAD>Watkins Sees Little Room For Debate Over AIDS Recommendations</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops with 6 grafs of new Watkins comments; picks up 4th graf,
`The AIDS'
^By JERRY ESTILL</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the White House AIDS
commission said today he sees little room for debate over his
strong recommendations, which are getting rave reviews from public
figures active in the battle against the disease.
   As affected groups challenged President Reagan to follow through
on the recommendations made public Thursday, commission chairman
James D. Watkins stressed his call for strong federal
anti-discrimination protection of AIDS victims. He said on NBC-TV's
``Today'' show that without such protection, fear among victims
will make the fatal disease ``very difficult to control.''
   The administration is on record _ through Health and Human
Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen _ as opposing federal legislation,
saying the issue should be addressed at the state and local level.
   Watkins, a retired Navy admiral, said there could still be
debate on the commission before the recommendations, which now
number 579, go to the president. But he said, in his opinion, there
is little room for debate.
   ``I believe we're there, and it's certainly, in my opinion, from
the nearly 600 recommendations, a kind of indictment on all of us
that we haven't done the job in being responsive to this
epidemic,'' Watkins said.
   Response to the report from members of Congress, gay rights
groups and health officials was enthusiastic.
   ``The AIDS commission is giving us sound recommendations,'' said
Rep.
   Henry Waxman, D-Calif. ``I hope the president will follow his
own commission's advice.''
   Waxman is among several members of Congress pushing for
anti-discrimination legislation.
   Tim Sweeney, deputy executive director of the New York-based Gay
Men's Health Crisis, termed the report ``courageous, aggressive and
compassionate.''
   ``We challenge the president, Congress and presidential
candidates to respond to this report by implementing its
recommendations,'' said Sweeney.
   Paul Kawata, director of the National AIDS Network, applauded
most of the report, particularly the sections calling for more
financial support for community-based AIDS groups. The National
AIDS Network is an umbrella organization covering more than 450
such local education and service agencies.
   Bailus Walker Jr., the former Massachusetts health commissioner
who heads the American Public Health Association, a private
organization of health professionals, said the recommendations
``are a rational, intelligent and compassionate response to the
epidemic'' and should ``serve as a blueprint for a coordinated
federal, state and local program designed to address the full scope
of the problem.''
   Most of the 269-page draft recommendations Watkins issued
Thursday are expected to be adopted with little substantive change
by the full commission and become its final report to the White
House on June 24.
   Watkins told reporters the proposals represent ``my estimate of
consensus within the commission,'' with the exception of a final
chapter which was not discussed in advance with other commissioners.
   In that chapter, Watkins calls for legislation giving the
surgeon general sweeping powers to deal with future national
medical emergencies that would be declared by a president.
   The report went on to call for ``federal legislation which
clearly provides comprehensive anti-discrimination protection for
HIV-infected individuals.''
   ``HIV-related discrimination is impairing this nation's ability
to limit the spread of the epidemic,'' Watkins' report said. ``As
long as discrimination occurs, and no strong national policy with
rapid and effective remedies against discrimination is established,
individuals who are infected with the HIV (the AIDS virus) will be
reluctant to come forward for testing, counseling and care.''
   Watkins said implementing all his recommendations probably would
call for spending about $3 billion a year more than is now being
budgeted for AIDS. About half that would be for expanded drug
treatment programs, a cornerstone of the commission's interim
report.
   Among the major Watkins recommendations:
   _Strong new laws on confidentiality, with sanctions to protect
the identity of those who test positive for the AIDS virus.
   _Greater state-federal financing of innovative methods of care
for people with AIDS.
   _Establishment of effective state partner-notification programs
targeted at those who have had sex with someone known by health
authorities to be infected with the virus.
   _Viewing the scope of the epidemic in terms of the number of
people infected with the virus _ perhaps as many as 1.4 million
Americans _ rather than the number who have so far developed AIDS,
less than 70,000. Scientists believe almost all of those infected
will eventually develop the disease itself.
   _Implementation of a comprehensive health education curriculum
in American schools, covering kindergarten through 12th grade, to
be in place by the year 2000. The curriculum _ including the point
at which AIDS should be discussed _ would be determined at the
local level.
   Under Watkins' plan, the surgeon general would take charge in
national health emergencies and be authorized to ``waive `business
as usual' procedures which impede emergency responsiveness.''
   Watkins says the present federal health bureaucracy has ``not
been successful in facilitating a response to a public health
emergency and resulted in a slow, halting and uneven response.''

<HEAD>PLO Leader Says Shultz `Moving Round in Vicious Circle'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat
said Secretary of State George Shultz will not succeed in reaching
peace in the Middle East unless his plan includes the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Arafat said Shultz, who headed to Egypt today to start his third
shuttle to promote a regional peace plan, is ``moving round in a
vicious circle.''
   In an interview with Abu Dhabi television broadcast late
Thursday, Arafat said the plan Shultz is promoting ``excludes the
Palestinian nation and its legitimate representative, the PLO.''
   ``He will not succeed with his plan because it runs counter to
the U.N. resolutions that recognize the Palestinian nation's right
to an independent state on its national soil,'' Arafat said.
   The PLO leader said the Shultz mission was designed ``to protect
Israel from the earthquake caused by the uprising and the
steadfastness in south Lebanon.''
   Arafat was referring to the uprising by Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that began Dec. 8.
Palestinians in south Lebanon, which borders Israel, mount
operations against the Israelis.
   Arafat gave the interview during a two-day visit to the United
Arab Emirates. He is touring Arab capitals before an Arab summit
June 7 in Algiers, Algeria, on the Palestinian uprising.
   The PLO has rejected the Shultz plan because it reportedly
envisages only a limited self-rule on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
in an initial phase and does not recognize the PLO, which is
fighting a guerrilla war for a Palestinian homeland, as the leader
of the Palestinians.
   The plan calls for an international peace conference and
negotiations on an Palestinian homeland.

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's address
Friday to the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Guildhall.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I wonder if you can imagine what it is for an American to stand
in this place. Back in the States we're terribly proud of anything
more than a few hundred years old. Some even see my election to the
presidency as America's attempt to show our European cousins that
we too have a regard for antiquity.
   Guild Hall has been here since the 15th Century, and while it is
comforting at my age to be near anything that much older than
myself, the venerable age of this institution is hardly all that
impresses. Who could come here and not think upon the moments these
walls have seen. Many times the people of this city and nation have
gathered here in national crisis or national triumph.
   In the darkest hours of the last world war, when the tense drama
of Edward R. Murrow's opening: ``This is London'' was enough to
impress on millions of Americans the mettle of the British people.
How many times in those days did proceedings continue here _ a
testimony to the cause of civilization for which you stood? From
the Marne to El Alamein to Arnhem to the Falklands, you have in
this century so often remained stedfast for what is right and
against what is wrong.
   You are a brave people, and this land truly is as your majestic
moving hymn proclaims, a land of hope and glory. Tht's why Nancy
and I, in the closing days of this historic trip, are glad to be in
England once again. After a long journey, we feel among friends,
and with all our hearts, we thank you for having us here. Such
feelings are, of course, especially appropriate to this occasion.
   I have come from Moscow to report to you, for truly the
relationship between the United States and Great Britain has been
critical to NATO's success in the cause of freedom. This hardly
means that we've always had a perfect understanding. When I first
visited Mrs. Thatcher at the British Embassy in 1981, she
mischievously reminded me that the huge portrait dominating the
grand staircase was none other than that of George III, though she
did graciously concede that today most of her countrymen would
agree with Jefferson that a little rebellion now and then is a good
thing. So, there has always been, as there should be among friends,
an element of fun about our differences. But let me assure you, it
is how much we have in common and the depth of our friendship that
truly matters.
   I have often mentioned this in the States, but I've never had an
opportunity to tell a British audience how, during my first visit
here 40 years ago, I was, like most Americans, anxious to see some
of the sites and those 400-year-old inns I'd been told abount in
this country. Well, the driver took me and a couple of other people
to an old inn, a pub really, in what America we would call a Mom
and Pop place.
   This elderly lady was waiting on us and finally, hearing us talk
to one another, she said, ``You're Americans, aren't you,'' and we
said we were. ``Oh,'' she said, ``there were a lot of your chaps
stationed down the road during the war.'' And she added, ``They
used to come in here in the evening and they'd have a songfest.
They called me Mom and they called the old man Pop.''
   And then the mood changed, and she said, ``It was Christmas eve,
and you know we were all alone and feeling a bit down, and suddenly
they burst through the door, and they had presents for me and
Pop.'' And by this time she wasn't looking at us anymore. She was
looking off into the distance into memory and with tears in her
eyes. And then she said, ``Big strappin' lads they was, from a
place called `Ioway.''
   Well, from a place called `Ioway' and Oregon, California, Texas,
New Jersey, Georgia, here with other young men from Lancaster,
Hampshire, Glasgow and Dorset, all of them caught up in the
terrible paradoxes of that time _ that young men must wage war to
end war and die for freedom so that freedom itself might live.
   And it is those same two causes for which they fought and died _
the cause of peace, the cause of freedom for all humanity, that
still brings us, British and American, together. For these causes
the people of Great Britain, the United States and other Allied
nations have for 44 years made enormous sacrifices to keep our
alliance strong and our military ready.
   For them, we embark in this decade on a new postwar strategy, a
forward strategy of freedom, a strategy of public candor about the
moral and fundamental differences between statism and democracy,
but also a strategy of vigorous diplomatic engagement _ a policy
that rejects both the inevitability of war or the permanence of
totalitarian rule, a policy based on realism that seeks not just
treaties for treaties' sake but the recognition and resolution of
fundamental differences with our adversaries.
   Pursuit of this policy has just now taken me to Moscow, and let
me say, I believe this policy is bearing fruit. Quite possibly,
we're beginning to break down the barriers of the postwar era.
Quite possibly, we are entering an era in history, a time of
lasting change in the Soviet Union. We will have to see. But, if
so, it's because of the stedfastness of the Allies, the
democracies, for more than 40 years, and especially in this decade.
   The history of our time will undoubtedly include a footnote
about how, during this decade and the last, the voices of retreat
and hopelessness reached a crescendo in the West, insisting the
only way to peace was unilateral disarmament, proposing nuclear
freezes, opposing deployment of counterbalancing weapons such as
intermediate-range missiles or the more recent concept of strategic
defense systems. These same voices ridiculed the notion of going
beyond arms control, the hope of doing something more than merely
establishing artificial limits within which arms buildups could
continue all but unabated.
   Arms reduction would never work, they said. And when the Soviets
left the negotiating in Geneva for 15 months, they proclaimed
disaster. And yet, it was our double-zero option, much maligned
when first proposed, that provided the basis for the INF treaty,
the first treaty ever that did not just control offensive weapons,
but reduced them. And yes, actually eliminated an entire class of
U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles.
   This treaty, last month's development in Afghanistan, the
changes we see in the Soviet Union, these are momentous events. Not
conclusive, but momentous. And that's why although history will
duly note that we, too, heard voices of denial and doubt, it is
those who spoke with hope and strength who will be best remembered.

   About 2,000 students from China's most
prestigious university took to the streets today to protest the
death of a fellow student in a brawl.
   The students at Beijing University put up posters angrily
demanding speedy punishment of local youths who killed the student
and tighter security around campus.
   Foreign sources said the illegal demonstration began
spontaneously at about 11 p.m. Thursday after students read a
poster on campus describing how Chai Qingfeng, a 22-year-old
geophysics student, had been attacked and killed.
   No participants were arrested.
   Officials said today that three people suspected in Chai's
slaying were detained and others were being sought.
   The demonstration was the largest since massive pro-democracy
rallies in December 1986 and January 1987. Those demonstrations led
to shakeups in the government and a conservative backlash against
``bourgeois liberalization.''
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
students arrived at Tiananmen Square, the large plaza in central
Beijing, shortly before dawn and passed through the square before
stopping at the Ministry of Public Security where they presented a
list of demands.
   About 700 students completed the 10-mile walk from the campus in
northwest Beijing to the square.
   During the march they linked arms and shouted for ``justice and
human rights.'' One banner read ``Pay back the blood debt.''
   Police monitored the march but did not interfere, said one
18-year-old marcher.
   The group marched around Tiananmen and then went to the nearby
Public Security Ministry, where ``the officials saidthey understood
us but that it is not a good idea to take to the streets,'' said
the woman marcher, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The students presented eight demands, including the speedy
arrest and punishment of the killers, then got on buses and
returned quietly to campus.
   Students said Chai was beaten to death by ``hooligans'' when he
was buying liquor at a store outside the campus. Campus officials
said the attack took place Wednesday night, and Chai died Thursday.
   The Beijing Daily reported today that Chai, a graduate student,
was among three students from the geophysics department who were
attacked by thugs outside a small restaurant near the campus. It
did not say whether the other two were injured.
   The daily quoted city officials as saying that such acts of
violence will not be tolerated in the capital and that they had
asked police to deal quickly and severely with the assailants.
   The students also demanded full media coverage of the slaying, a
memorial service on campus for Chai, government compensation for
his family and tighter campus security.
   One poster called for a boycott of classes until the killers
were arrested, but students said most students attended classes.
   Last December about 1,000 students from the University of
Foreign Economic Relations in Beijing demonstrated over a similar
incident when a student was knifed to death by hoodlums.
   One of the attackers in that incident, a 22-year-old man, was
executed.

<HEAD>60 Percent of Doctors in Survey Say Euthanasia May Be Justified</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty percent of doctors responding to a survey
said they have had patients for whom they thought euthanasia would
be justified if legal, and 59 percent of those said they would have
administered a lethal drug if permitted.
   The survey, conducted by the Center for Health Ethics and Policy
at the University of Colorado at Denver, was intended to spark
discussion on questions of death and dying, said Dr. Frederick
Abrams, associate director of the center.
   Questionnaires were mailed to 7,095 doctors in Colorado, and
2,218 responded by the January deadline.
   ``In one form or another, euthanasia is being practiced by
decent professionals and supported by the affected patients. Yet it
is opposed by large numbers of people. We must develop consensus in
Colorado concerning legal and ethical ground rules,'' Abrams said.
   Thirty-seven percent of the doctors responding to the
questionnaire said said they had given pain medication even though
it would hasten the patient's death.
   And 4 percent of the doctors said they had helped patients
stockpile lethal doses of medication, knowing that the drugs might
be used to commit suicide.
   Euthanasia is defined in Webster's New World Dictionary as
``causing death painlessly so as to end suffering; advocated by
some as a way to deal with persons dying of incurable, painful
diseases.''
   On the question of prolonging life, 90 percent of the doctors
said quality of life should be a consideration when deciding
whether or not someone is to be treated with critical-care
technology.
   A strong majority _ 88 percent _ said Colorado's living will law
should be changed to allow the patient to decline food or fluid.
And 85 percent thought the law that denies the patient the option
to refuse food and fluid is unsatisfactory.
   Colorado's living will law allows competent adults to direct
future withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining procedures
should they become unconscious or incompetent to decide on medical
treatment.

   And here I want to say that through all the troubles of the last
decade, one such firm eloquent voice, a voice that proclaimed
proudly the cause of the Western Alliance and human freedom, has
been heard. A voice that never sacrificed its anti-communist
credentials or its realistic appraisal of change in the Soviet
Union, but because it came from the longest serving leader in the
alliance, it did become one of the first to suggest that we could
do business with Mr. Gorbachev.
   So let me discharge my first official duty here today. Prime
Minister, the achievements of the Moscow summit as well as the
Geneva and Washington summits, say much about your valor and
strength, and by virtue of the office you hold, that of the British
people. So let me say simply, at this hour in history, Prime
Minister, the entire world salutes you and your gallant people and
gallant nation.
   And while your leadership and the vision of the British people
have been an inspiration, not just to my own people but to all of
those love freedom and yearn for peace, I know you join me in a
deep sense of gratitude toward the leaders and peoples of all the
democratic allies. Whether deploying crucial weapons of deterrence,
standing fast in the Persian Gulf, combating terrorism and
aggression by outlaw regions or helping freedom fighters around the
globe, rarely in history has any alliance of free nations acted
with such firmness and dispatch, and on so many fronts.
   In the process, reaching back as far as the founding NATO and
the Common Market, the house of Western Europe, together with the
United States, Canada, Japan and others, this house of democracy
engaged in an active diplomacy while sparking a startling growth of
democratic institutions and free markets all across the globe. In
short, an expansion of the frontiers of freedom and a lessening of
the chances of war.
   And so it is within this context that I report now on events in
Moscow.
   On Wednesday at 8:20 Greenwich time, Mr. Gorbachev and I
exchanged the instruments of ratification of the INF treaty. So,
too, we made tangible progress toward the START treaty on strategic
weapons. Such a treaty, with all its implications is, I believe,
now within our grasp. But part of the realism and candor we were
determined to bring to negotiations with the Soviets meant refusing
to put all the weight of these negotiations and our bilateral
relationship on the single issue of arms control.
   As I never tire of saying, nations do not distrust each other
because they are armed. They are armed because they distrust each
other. So equally important items on the agenda dealt with critical
issues like regional conflicts, human rights and bilateral
exchanges.
   With regard to regional conflicts, here, too, we are in the
third week of the pullout of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The
importance of this step should not be underestimated. Our third
area of discussion was bilateral contacts between our peoples, an
expanding program of student exchanges, of the opening of cultural
centers, progress toward a broader understanding of each other.
   And finally, on the issue of human rights, granting people the
right to speak, write, travel and worship freely, there are signs
of greater individual freedom.
   Now, originally I was going to give you just an accounting on
these items. But you know on my first day in Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev
used a Russian saying, `Better to see something once than to hear
about it a hundred times.'
   So if I might go beyond our four-part agenda today and offer
just a moment or too of personal reflection on the country I saw
for the first time. In all aspects of Soviet life, the talk is of
progress toward democratic reform. In the economy, in political
institutions, in religious, social and artistic life, it is called
glasnost, openness. It is perestroika, restructuring.
   Mr. Gorbachev and I discussed his upcoming party conference
where many of these reforms will be debated and perhaps adopted.
Such things as official accountability, limitations on length of
service in office, an independent judiciary, revisions of the
criminal law and lowering the taxes on cooperatives. In short,
giving individuals more freedom to run their own affairs, to
control their own destinies.

   To those of us familiar with the postwar era, all of this is
cause for shaking the head in wonder. Imagine, the president of the
United States and the general secretary of the Soviet Union walking
together in Red Square, talking about a growing personal friendship
and meeting together average citizens, realizing how much our
people have in common. It was a special moment in a week of special
moments.
   My personal impression of Mr. Gorbachev is that he is a serious
man, seeking serious reform. I pray that the hand of the Lord will
be on the Soviet people, the people who faces Nancy and I saw
everywhere we went. Believe me, there was one thing about those
faces that we will never forget. They were the faces of hope, the
hope of a new era in human history and hopefully an era of peace
and freedom for all.
   And yet, while the Moscow summit showed great promise and the
response of the Soviet people was heartening, let me interject here
a note of caution and, I hope, prudence. It has never been disputes
between free peoples and the peoples of the Soviet Union that have
been at the heart of post-war tensions and conflicts. Moral
disputes among governments over the pursuit of statism and
expansionism have been central points in our difficulties.
   But now that the allies are strong and expansionism is receding
around the world and the Soviet Union, there is hope, and we look
for this trend to continue. We must do all we can to assist it, and
this means openly acknowledging positive change and crediting it.
But let us also remember the strategy that we have adopted is one
that provides for setbacks along the way as well as progress. Let
us embrace honest change when it occurs, but let us also be wary.
Let us stay strong. And let us be confident too.
   Prime Minister, perhaps you remember that upon accepting your
gracious invitation to address the members of the Parliament in
1982, I suggested then that the world could well be at a turning
point when the two great threats to life in this century _ nuclear
war and totalitarian rule _ might now be overcome.
   In an accounting of what might lie ahead for the rest of the
alliance, I suggested that the hard evidence of the totalitarian
experiment was now in, and that this evidence had led to an
uprising of the intellect and will, one that reaffirmed the dignity
of the individual in the face of the modern state. I suggested,
too, that in a way, Marx was right when he said the political order
would come into conflict with the economic order, only he was wrong
in predicting which part of the world this would occur in.
   For the crisis came not in the capitalist West but in the
communist East. Noting the economic difficulties reaching the
critical stage in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe, I said
that at other times in history, the ruling elites have faced such
situations and when they encountered resolve and determination from
free nations, decided to loosen their grip. It was then I suggested
that the tides of history were running in the cause of liberty, but
only if we as free men and women joined together in a worldwide
movement toward democracy, a crusade for freedom, a crusade that
would be not so much a struggle of armed might, not so much a test
of bombs and rockets, as a test of faith and will.
   Well, that crusade for freedom, that crusade for peace, is well
under way. We have found the will. We have held fast to the faith.
And whatever happens, whatever triumphs or disappointments ahead,
we must keep to this strategy of strength and candor, this strategy
of hope _ hope in the eventual triumph of freedom.
   But as we move forward, let us not fail to note the lessons
we've learned along the way in developing our strategy. We have
learned the first objective of the adversaries of freedom is to
make free nations question their own faith in freedom, to make us
think that adhering to our principles and speaking out against
human rights abuses or foreign aggression, is somehow an act of
belligerence. Well over the long run, such inhibitions make free
peoples silent and ultimately halfhearted about their cause. This
is the first and most important defeat free nations can ever suffer.

   Hailed by trumpet fanfares and cheering crowds,
President Reagan today savored London's pageantry-filled tribute to
his performance at the Moscow summit and a toast from Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher as ``one of the greatest U.S.
presidents.''
   The president rode triumphantly through the streets of the
British capital near the end of a two-day stopover en route home
from Moscow. Londoners waved at his motorcade from along the River
Thames, from the tops of doubledecker buses and from boats in Hyde
Park's Serpentine Lake.
   Flanked by bewigged, scarlet-robed city fathers at Guildhall,
the 12th century seat of London's lord mayor, Reagan was welcomed
as a peacemaker and won a standing ovation for an emotional speech
on East-West relations, laced with jibes at the anti-nuclear lobby
and jokes about his age.
   Lord Mayor Sir Greville Spratt invoked the names of Ulysses S.
Grant and Woodrow Wilson, past U.S. presidents who have spoken at
Guildhall, and reached to Milton and Shakespeare for words to
describe his admiration for Reagan.
   Not to be outdone, Mrs. Thatcher quoted Tennyson's line,
``Strong in will, to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield.''
Turning to Reagan, she said:
   ``Thank you Mr. President, thank you for the summit, thank you
for your presidency, thank you for your testament of belief and God
bless America.''
   The only visible dissent came from actress Julie Christie and
eight other British show business personalities who picketed
Guildhall during Reagan's speech to protest U.S. involvement in
Nicaragua. They waved placards reading, ``U.S. Out of Central
America'' and distributed leaflets urging withdrawal of support for
the Contra rebels.
   ``The president saw a more open society in Red Square than here
in London,'' Miss Christie said, complaining that police kept the
demonstrators out of sight of the president's motorcade.
   Mrs. Thatcher hailed Reagan's summit talks as ``a tremendous
success.''
   Reagan returned the compliment, paying a special tribute to his
close friend and ally. The president noted that Mrs. Thatcher had
been among the first to suggest the West could ``do business'' with
Gorbachev.
   ``At this hour in history, prime minister, the entire world
salutes you and your gallant people and gallant nation,'' he said.
   Most of Reagan's 26-hour visit was ceremonial, including
parades, tea with Queen Elizabeth II, and dinner at Mrs. Thatcher's
residence at 10 Downing St.
   The prime minister said she was especially pleased with Reagan's
strong stance on human rights and his street encounters with
Muscovites because ``the Russian people would find it difficult now
to see the United States as a threat in the future.''
   Reagan told her he felt Gorbachev was ``vigorous and determined
to carry out'' his reform program, officials said.
   Reagan invited Mrs. Thatcher to Washington in November after the
presidential election to see him before he leaves office. She
immediately accepted, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said she presumably would also meet the president-elect.
   Unlike U.S. presidents, who are limited to two terms, British
prime ministers can serve for an indefinite period. Mrs. Thatcher,
having been elected three times, has indicated she wants to lead
her Conservative Party to a fourth victory.
   Mrs. Thatcher, a firm believer in nuclear deterrence, is wary of
sweeping arms cuts. A British official speaking on condition of
anonymity said Reagan told Mrs. Thatcher he would not be rushed
into an agreement to halve the superpowers' long-range nuclear
missiles.
   ``We don't have any reservations about the position of the
United States on this,'' the British official said.
   But when a reporter asked Reagan to comment on Gorbachev's claim
that arms negotiations were going too slowly, he replied: ``I'd
like to speed them up.''
   Shortly after their arrival Thursday, the President and Mrs.
Reagan drove to Buckingham Palace, where there were waves and
cheers from some 1,500 spectators as they drove through the ornate
black-and-gold gates of the 285-year-old palace. They were greeted
by Queen Elizabeth II.
   ``Nice to see you again. How are you Mr. President?'' said the
queen, entering the marble-columned main hall wearing a
sapphire-blue dress.
   A reporter asked Reagan if he was glad to be out of Moscow and
in London. Reagan replied diplomatically: ``Let me put it very
simply: I'm very happy to be in London.''
   Elizabeth received the Reagans alone, since her husband Prince
Philip was out of town. Her son and heir Prince Charles later
called on Mrs. Reagan at the ambassador's home.
   From the palace, Reagan drove to nearby Whitehall to inspect an
honor guard in the graceful, columned quadrangle of the Foreign
Office.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 62, whose nine years in office have paralleled

   The Moscow summit eased tensions between
the United States and the Soviet Union, but U.S. intransigence
prevented progress on nuclear disarmament, news reports in
communist Eastern Europe said today.
   ``Some shady aspects of President Reagan's visit cannot
overshadow the fact that the summit turned into a significant
political event blazing the trail toward the 21st century,''
Otechestven Front, a Bulgarian daily said.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev met in Moscow from
Sunday to Thursday. It was their fourth meeting.
   An editorial in the Czechoslovak Communist Party newspaper Rude
Pravo said the Soviet-U.S. dialogue had reached ``a new higher
level after several `icy' years.'' But it added: The United States
has gone a considerable part of the way but does not want to go to
the end of this road.''
   Rude Pravo said, ``U.S. politicians cherish an illusion that
nuclear weapons `protect peace' ... and that is why they are
necessary for U.S. security. They also claim that space weapons
protect against nuclear weapons.''
   The daily criticized the United States for ``stubbornly trying
to gain unilateral advantages ... mainly in ... talks on a 50
percent reduction of strategic weapons and in such an important
question as the SDI program.''
   The Soviet Union also has called on the United States to scrap
the proposed Space Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars.'''
   In Hungary, Magyar Nemzet, the daily of the Communist-led
Patriotic People's Front, commented: ``One can already feel the
beneficial effect of an international crisis-settling mechanism in
motion and ... a compromise-oriented approach on the part of both
superpowers seems to be taking shape.''
   The Hungarian trade union daily Nepszava said: ``Even if there
have been some less heartening moments at this summit, like
Reagan's meeting with dissenters, his meetings with the Soviet
people took place in an atmopshere that washed away the memory of
such moments.''
   It added, ``Naturally, we would have simply loved to read in the
joint communique a reference to `a great leap forward' toward the
next missile treaty ... We regret that instead of a leap only a
modest step has been taken.''
   The East German Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland said:
   ``It is with great satisfaction that all those who are committed
toward securing peace have also accepted the fact that now there is
a joint draft of a text for a treaty on reducing and limiting
strategic offensive weapons.''
   The Polish Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu said: ``One cannot
shake the impression that the American side did not rid itself of
the deeply rooted prejudices and inhibitions.''
   ``All smiles, but what is inside it?'' said one Polish
journalist, who was asked for his reaction.
   ``We are satisfied,'' Stefan Staniszewski, a spokesman for the
Polish Foreign Ministry, said. ``We think that the summit was
successful. ... Not (only) as a summit but as a process which will
be continued in the future.''
   The summit shows the Soviet and U.S. governments see each other
as partners ``in a way in which they were not always able to see
themselves in the past,'' said Warsaw's Zycie Warszawy daily. ``It
warrants the presumption that the change of the U.S. presidency
should not alter the practice now adopted.''

   Hailed by trumpet fanfares and cheering crowds,
President Reagan today savored London's pageantry-filled tribute to
his performance at the Moscow summit and a toast from Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher as ``one of the greatest U.S.
presidents.''
   The president rode triumphantly through the streets of the
British capital near the end of a two-day stopover en route home
from Moscow. Londoners waved at his motorcade from along the River
Thames, from the tops of double-decker buses and from boats in Hyde
Park's Serpentine Lake.
   Flanked by bewigged, scarlet-robed city fathers at Guildhall,
the 12th century seat of London's lord mayor, Reagan was welcomed
as a peacemaker and won a standing ovation for an emotional speech
on East-West relations, laced with jibes at the anti-nuclear lobby
and jokes about his age.
   Lord Mayor Sir Greville Spratt invoked the names of Ulysses S.
Grant and Woodrow Wilson, past U.S. presidents who have spoken at
Guildhall, and reached to Milton and Shakespeare for words to
describe his admiration for Reagan.
   Not to be outdone, Mrs. Thatcher quoted Tennyson's line,
``Strong in will, to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield.''
Turning to Reagan, she said:
   ``Thank you Mr. President, thank you for the summit, thank you
for your presidency, thank you for your testament of belief and God
bless America.''
   The only visible dissent came from actress Julie Christie and
eight other British show business personalities who picketed
Guildhall during Reagan's speech to protest U.S. involvement in
Nicaragua. They waved placards reading, ``U.S. Out of Central
America'' and distributed leaflets urging withdrawal of support for
the Contra rebels.
   ``The president saw a more open society in Red Square than here
in London,'' Miss Christie said, complaining that police kept the
demonstrators out of sight of the president's motorcade.
   Mrs. Thatcher hailed Reagan's summit talks as ``a tremendous
success.''
   Reagan returned the compliment, paying a special tribute to his
close friend and ally. The president noted that Mrs. Thatcher had
been among the first to suggest the West could ``do business'' with
Gorbachev.
   ``At this hour in history, prime minister, the entire world
salutes you and your gallant people and gallant nation,'' he said.
   Most of Reagan's 26-hour visit was ceremonial, including
parades, tea with Queen Elizabeth II, and dinner at Mrs. Thatcher's
residence at 10 Downing St.
   The prime minister said she was especially pleased with Reagan's
strong stance on human rights and his street encounters with
Muscovites because ``the Russian people would find it difficult now
to see the United States as a threat in the future.''
   Reagan told her he felt Gorbachev was ``vigorous and determined
to carry out'' his reform program, officials said.
   Reagan invited Mrs. Thatcher to Washington in November after the
presidential election to see him before he leaves office. She
immediately accepted, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said she presumably would also meet the president-elect.
   Unlike U.S. presidents, who are limited to two terms, British
prime ministers can serve for an indefinite period. Mrs. Thatcher,
having been elected three times, has indicated she wants to lead
her Conservative Party to a fourth victory.
   Mrs. Thatcher, a firm believer in nuclear deterrence, is wary of
sweeping arms cuts. A British official speaking on condition of
anonymity said Reagan told Mrs. Thatcher he would not be rushed
into an agreement to halve the superpowers' long-range nuclear
missiles.
   ``We don't have any reservations about the position of the
United States on this,'' the British official said.
   But when a reporter asked Reagan to comment on Gorbachev's claim
that arms negotiations were going too slowly, he replied: ``I'd
like to speed them up.''
   Shortly after their arrival Thursday, the President and Mrs.
Reagan drove to Buckingham Palace, where there were waves and
cheers from some 1,500 spectators as they drove through the ornate
black-and-gold gates of the 285-year-old palace. They were greeted
by Queen Elizabeth II.
   ``Nice to see you again. How are you Mr. President?'' said the
queen, entering the marble-columned main hall wearing a
sapphire-blue dress.
   A reporter asked Reagan if he was glad to be out of Moscow and
in London. Reagan replied diplomatically: ``Let me put it very
simply: I'm very happy to be in London.''
   Elizabeth received the Reagans alone, since her husband Prince
Philip was out of town. Her son and heir Prince Charles later
called on Mrs. Reagan at the ambassador's home.
   From the palace, Reagan drove to nearby Whitehall to inspect an
honor guard in the graceful, columned quadrangle of the Foreign
Office.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 62, whose nine years in office have paralleled
the Reagan tenure and forged close ties, received him with a warm
embrace of clasped elbows.
   The Welsh Guards in their scarlet tunics and tall black bearskin
hats played the American anthem and two Irving Berlin hits.
   Then Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher walked next door to 10 Downing St.
for talks, and Mrs. Reagan arrived later for a dinner of lobster
mousse, chicken with pate de fois gras and raspberries.
   After dinner Mrs. Thatcher and Reagan watched from a window as
horsemen and a band performed the ceremony of Beating Retreat, one
of the rituals leading up to the queen's birthday.

<HEAD>LONDON: ever suffer.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For when free peoples cease telling the truth about and to their
adversaries, they cease telling the truth to themselves. In matters
of state, unless the truth be spoken, it ceases to exist. It is in
this sense that the best indicator of how much we care about
freedom is what we say about freedom. It is in this sense that
words truly are actions. And there is one added and quite
extraordinary benefit to this sort of realism and public candor:
This is also the best way to avoid war or conflict.
   Too often in the past, the adversaries of freedom forgot the
reserves of strength and resolve among free peoples. Too often they
interpreted conciliatory words as weakness and too often they
miscalculated and underestimated the willingness of free men and
women to resist to the end. Words of freedom remind them otherwise.
   This is the lesson we've learned, the lesson of the last war,
yes, the lesson of Munich. But it is also the lesson taught us by
Sir Winston, by London in the Blitz, by the enduring pride and
faith of the British people.
   Just a few years ago, Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth, and I stood
at the Normandy beaches to commemorate the selflessness that comes
from such pride and faith. It is well we recall the lessons of our
alliance.
   And I wonder if you might permit me to recall one other this
morning _ Operation Market Garden, it was called three months after
Overlord and the rescue of Europe began, a plan to suddenly drop
British and American airborne divisions on the Netherlands and open
up a drive into the heart of Germany.
   A battalion of British paratroopers was given the great task of
seizing the bridge deep in enemy territory at Arnhem. For the
terrible 10 days, they held out. Some years ago, a reunion of those
magnificent veterans, British, Americans and others of our allies,
was held in New York City.
   From the dispatch by The New York Times, reporter Maurice
Carroll, there was this paragraph. `Look at him,' said Henry Knapp,
an Amsterdam newspaper man who headed the Dutch underground's
intelligence operation in Arnhem. He gestured toward Gen. John
Frost, a bluff Britainer who had committed the battalion that held
the bridge. `Look at him, still with that black mustache. If you
put him at the end of a bridge today and said, `Keep it,' he'd keep
it.' The story mentioned the wife of Cornelius Ryan, the American
writer who memorialized Market Garden in his book, `A Bridge Too
Far.'
   He told the reporter just as Mr. Ryan was finishing his book,
writing the final paragraphs about Gen. Frost's valiant stand at
Arnhem, about how in his eyes, his men would always be undefeated.
Her husband burst into tears. That was quite unlike him. And Mrs.
Ryan, alarmed, rushed to him. The writer could only look up and say
of Gen. Frost, `Honestly, what that man went through.'
   A few days ago, seated there in Spaso House with Soviet
dissidents, I had that same thought and asked myself, what won't
men suffer for freedom.
   The dispatch about the Arnhem veteran concluded with this quote
from Gen. Frost about his visits to that bridge.
   `We've been going back ever since. Every year we have a, what's
the word, reunion? Now there's a word.'
   He turned to his wife. `Dear, what's the word for going to
Arnhem.'
   `Reunion,' she said. `No,' he said. `There's a special word.'
   She pondered. `Pilgrimage,' she said. `Yes, pilgrimage,' Gen.
Frost said.
   As those veterans of Arnhem view their time, so too, we must
view ours. Ours is also a pilgrimage _ a pilgrimage toward those
things we honor and love. Human dignity. The hope of freedom for
all peoples and for all nations.
   And I've always cherished the belief that all of history is such
a pilgrimage and that our Maker, while never denying us free will,
does over time guide us with a wise and provident hand, giving
direction to history and slowly bringing it good from evil, leading
us ever so slowly, but ever so relentlessly and lovingly, to a
moment when the will of man and God are as one again.

<TEXT>
   I cherish, too, the hope that what we have done together
throughout this decade and in Moscow this week has helped bring
mankind along the road of that pilgrimage. If this be so, prayerful
recognition of what we're about as a civilization and a people, has
played its part. I mean, of course, the great civilized ideas that
comprise so much of your heritage. The development of law embodied
by your constitutional traditions, the idea of restraint on
centralized power and individual rights, as established in your
Magna Carta. The idea of representative government as embodied by
the mother of all Parliaments.
   But we go beyond even this. Your own Evelyn Waugh, who reminded
us that civilization _ and by this I do not mean talking cinemas
and tinned food nor even soldiery and hygenic houses _ but the
whole moral and artistic organization of Europe, has not in itself
the power of survival. It came into being, he said, through the
Judeo-Christian tradition, and without it, has no significance or
power to command allegiance. It is no longer possible, he wrote, to
accept the benefits of civilization and at the same time deny the
supernatural basis on which it rests.
   And so it is first things we must consider. And here it is a
story _ one last story _ that can remind us best of what we're
about. It's a story that a few years ago came in the guise of that
art form for which I had an understandable affection, the cinema.
It's a story about the 1920 Olympics and two British athletes _
Harold Abrahams, a young Jew whose victory, as his immigrant
Arab-Italian coach put it, was a triumph for all those who have
come from distant lands and found freedom and refuge here in
England.
   And Eric Lidell, a young Scotsman who would not sacrifice
religious conviction for fame. In one unforgettable scene, Eric
Lidell reads the words of Isaiah. `He giveth power to the faint and
to them that have no might, he increased their strength. But they
that waiteth on the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall
mount up, with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary.'
   Here, then, is our formula for completing our crusade for
freedom. Here, the strength of our civilization and our belief in
the rights of humanity. Our faith is in a higher law. Yes, we
believe in prayer and its power. And like the founding fathers of
both our lands, we hold that humanity was meant not to be
dishonored by the all-powerful state, but to live in image and
likeness of Him who made us.
   More than five decades ago when an American president told his
generation that they had a rendezvous with destiny, at almost the
same moment, a prime minister asked the British people for their
finest hour. This rendezvous, this finest hour, is still upon us.
Let us seek to do His will in all things, to stand for freedom, to
speak for humanity. Come my friends, as it was said of old by
Tennyson, it is not too late to seek a newer world.
   Thank you.

<HEAD>Fain Ordered to Stand Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Killer-rapist William Archie Fain, whose
release caused a public outcry, has been ordered to stand trial on
charges of attempting to rape a preschool teacher and slashing her
face.
   The ruling came Thursday from Municipal Court Judge Peggy Hora
after a six-week preliminary hearing in which she twice threatened
one of Fain's attorneys with contempt.
   Fain, 42, was ordered to appear in Alameda County Superior Court
in Oakland June 17, when a trial date will be set.
   Fain was paroled in 1983 after serving 16 years in prison for
murdering a 17-year-old boy and raping two 16-year-old girls near
the Stanislaus County town of Oakdale.
   Public outcry followed news of his scheduled release and the
state parole board canceled it. State courts ruled the action
illegal and ordered him freed. Gov. George Deukmejian then tried to
block his parole, but the courts ruled against the governor.
   Fain, who remains in custody without bail, is charged in a Jan.
22 attack on Jean Marie James at the Montessori Children's Center.
   He is accused of breaking into the school, throwing the
20-year-old woman to the ground, straddling her and slashing her
from the upper lip to the nose.
   Fain has pleaded innocent to charges of burglary, assault,
attempted rape, assault with intent to commit rape and being armed
wih a deadly weapon while committing the other crimes.
   Fain's lawyers, Robert Bell and Ralph Lopez, were ordered to
come back to Hora's court July 12, when a hearing will be set to
determine if the two should be fined up to $1,500 each for
allegedly causing unnecessary delays.
   Hora twice threatened to cite Bell for contempt, saying he was
not prepared and was wasting the court's time. Bell said he will
seek a change of venue for Fain's trial.
   Since his release, Fain has been acquitted of failing to
register as a sex offender in California and Arizona, and convicted
and sentenced to jail for loitering in San Jose and drunken driving
in Santa Cruz and Fremont.

<HEAD>Iraq Says Iranian Plane Tried To Bomb President's Residence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-built Iranian plane today tried to
bomb Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's residence north of Baghdad,
but ground defenses chased the aircraft away, the Iraqi military
command announced.
   In a statement carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency, the
military command said the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber attempted to
attack the residence at 5:55 a.m.
   While maneuvering to evade the ground fire, the plane dropped
its load of explosives in an area close to the president's home in
the village of Ouja, the report said. No one was hurt in the
incident, it said.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Hussein chaired a meeting
of the country's ruling Revolutionary Command Council just after
the attempt.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980. The two
sides have periodically bombed each other's cities in what has been
called ``the war of the cities,'' which began in 1984.
   The statement did not say if Saddam was at the residence, just
south of his hometown of Tikrit, during the attempt.
   It did not explain how the plane flew undetected all the way
from the border, 110 miles to the east. Tikrit is about 100 miles
northwest of Baghdad.
   But military analysts say, flying at ground level, an F-4 could
evade radar nets.
   On Thursday, Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, appointed the powerful parliament speaker, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, acting commander-in-chief. The post had been held by
Khomeini himself since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   Addrssing a Moslem prayer congregation at Tehran University,
Rafsanjani said today that Iranians must take the war with Iraq
``more seriously,'' especially after recent defeats on the war
fronts.
   Iraqi troops have recaptured territories in two major offensives
in recent weeks. They retook the southern Faw peninsula in April
and dislodged the Iranians from Shalamchah, a startegic area east
of the southern city of Basra, last month.

<HEAD>Two City Officials Reconsidering Smoking Ban After Tobacco Co.
Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least two of the five city directors in
this tobacco market center are reconsidering their support of a
smoking ban following objections from a local tobacco company.
   A policy banning smoking in the main lobby of City Hall, City
Commission chambers, the city bus station and a handful of other
places took effect Wednesday over protests from Pinkerton Tobacco
Co., Daviess County's largest industrial employer.
   Owensboro is a major tobacco sales center for western Kentucky
burley. The Daviess County Farm Bureau estimates that area tobacco
sales topped $25 million last year.
   Pinkerton, in a letter dated May 20, notified Mayor David
Adkisson that it will reconsider plans to expand in the county
because of the ban.
   ``If, as it appears, your recent enactment of a ban on our
products is indicative of this community's attitude toward the
tobacco industry, our company and our products, then the time has
come for us to begin rethinking our plans for the future,'' Luther
Pittman, executive vice president of Pinkerton, wrote.
   Pinkerton, which employs 504 people at its Daviess County plant,
is the nation's leading manufacturer of loose leaf and plug chewing
tobaccos, Pittman said. The company also makes smoking tobacco
products.
   Pittman said his letter does not mean the company is planning to
pull out of Daviess County.
   But Pinkerton is in the process of acquiring smoking tobacco
brands from The American Tobacco Company in Richmond, Va., he said,
and had planned to move manufacturing and distribution operations
linked to such an acquisition to Owensboro.
   Adkisson said he did not consider Pittman's letter a threat by
the company to leave town. The smoking ban passed unanimously and
Adkisson said he still supports it.
   But Commissioner Jack Ross, who voted with the three other
commissioners and the mayor to approve the policy, said Thursday
the board overreacted.
   And Commissioner Waymond Morris, principal of Daviess County
High School, said he ``probably will vote to rescind'' the policy.
   He said the policy ``is doing something we didn't intend to
do,'' namely, offending tobacco interests.
   Another commissioner, Alan Braden, said he is still weighing the
policy's benefits against its effects on tobacco interests.
   Adkisson said that in the past Pinkerton has produced mostly
smokeless tobacco, and he didn't think about the company being
adversely affected.

<HEAD>Fire-Ravaged Skyscraper To Upgrade Fire Alarms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fire-ravaged First Interstate Bank tower
will get an upgraded fire alarm system and a $3-million sprinkler
system as part of a deal to reopen the 62-story downtown high-rise,
fire officials said.
   The skyscraper that is California's tallest building has been
closed since May 4, when a fire gutted 4{ floors, killing one man
and injuring about 40 other people.
   City fire officials announced Thursday that a partnership of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society and UCB Realty Corp. was agreeable
to upgrading its alarm system beyond what is required by law.
   The upgrades will include additional smoke detectors, fire doors
to enclose elevator vestibules and a third water pump for the
sprinkler and water standpipes.
   The improvements don't have to be completed before tenants
return as long as the existing system is working properly, said
city Fire Department Battalion Chief Kenneth Johnson.
   Tower owners have verbally agreed to the upgrading, although the
exact timetable and specifications are still being negotiated,
Johnson said.
   ``We are obviously going to work hand in hand with fire
officials. It's obviously in our best interests and the best
interests of our tenants,'' said Jerry Poppink, a spokesman for the
Equitable-UCB partnership, which owns the building.
   When the May 4 fire broke out, the building's sprinkler system
was nearly 90 percent complete but not operational. A building
spokesman said owners expect to restore the existing fire alarm
system and activate the sprinklers by next month.
   Sprinklers weren't mandatory for the high-rise because it was
built a year before a law requiring sprinklers took effect in 1974.
   Meanwhile, the Fire Department is continuing to investigate
whether to seek misdemeanor charges in the case in connection with
possible fire code violations, said Capt. John Scherrei.
   ``Was there a delayed alarm? Were the security people informed
of what to do? Were they notified to call the Fire Department? Were
there code violations?'' Scherrei said, listing the key questions
in the Fire Department's investigation.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women should not throw out their thyroid
prescriptions even though a commonly prescribed hormone may cause
some long-term thinning of the bones, a doctor says.
   The most commonly prescribed thyroid hormone, L-thyroxine,
previously had been considered safe when taken over a number of
years, says a study in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   But 31 young women treated with L-thyroxine for at least five
years were found to have 10 percent to 13 percent less bone density
in their hips than 31 women in a comparison group matched for age
and weight, the study said.
   Loss of bone mass, also called osteoporosis, is usually most
serious in women after menopause and is largely to blame for the
hip fractures that afflict one-third of women who reach age 90, the
study said.
   But one of the authors cautioned that the study is only
preliminary and ``we don't know, and we are not suggesting, that
these very small changes in hip will be associated with an
increased fracture rate.''
   ``We are not saying thyroid hormone should not be used because
it causes bone loss,'' said the co-author, Dr. Lewis E. Braverman
of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.
   ``We are saying the dose of L-thyroxine should be carefully
adjusted to the individual need of the patient, which can now be
done with sensitive new assays,'' he added in a telephone interview
Thursday.
   Before new tests were developed about two years ago to measure
precise blood levels of L-thyroxine, marketed as Levothroid and
Synthroid, doctors were more likely to prescribe excess levels,
Braverman said.
   Most of the millions of patients who take it must take it
indefinitely to counteract the hormone deficiency created by an
underactive thyroid gland, thyroid cancer or a condition known as
goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid that leads to a swelling of
the neck.
   Hypothyroidism causes body functions to slow down and, if
untreated, can lead to a deterioration in the person's physical and
mental health. The problem can become so severe that simple mental
tasks, such as adding up a bill, take longer.
   ``One of the risks in something (a finding) like this is you
have people say, `I'm going to stop taking my thyroid so I won't
get osteoporosis.' That's disastrous,'' Braverman said.
   But an editorial accompanying the study in the journal suggested
that doctors may need to rethink their approach to treating thyroid
hormone deficiencies.
   ``Is it appropriate to treat a benign thyroid problem with a
medication that potentially could cause osteoporosis?'' asked the
editorial, by Dr. David S. Cooper of Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine in Baltimore.
   ``The whole concept of suppression therapy for benign thyroid
disease may need re-evaluation, especially in older women, whose
skeletons are the most likely to be in jeopardy,'' he said.
   The study found no loss of bone mass in the spine, the doctors
said. Spinal bone loss can cause the reduction in height and back
curvature that mark advanced cases of osteoporosis.

<DATELINE>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ended almost two
decades of judicial supervision of the Oxford Municipal School
District, ruling that it now complies with desegregation
regulations.
   The district ``has become fully unitary in all aspects ... 19
years has certainly been more than a reasonable time to continue
under supervision of a federal court,'' U.S. District Judge William
C. Keady said in an an order filed here Thursday.
   The school system had been under court order since it was
ordered desegregated in 1969 following a complaint filed by blacks
in 1968.
   The district sought to have the order lifted and the issue was
argued in a two-day hearing in May.
   Blacks, represented by lawyer and local NAACP president Alvin
Chambliss, argued that the system was still discriminatory in
achievement grouping, employment, activities and discipline.
   The district has about 2,700 students in two elementary schools
and a junior and senior high school. About half are white and half
are black.
   Keady said the system has been supported by the community and
``white flight to a nearby academy has been minimal.''
   Under the court order, the district had been required to submit
lengthy reports on its activities to the court twice a year, said
Superintendent Bob McCord.
   McCord said the district was pleased more with what the ruling
said than its lifting of the paperwork.
   ``I think what this says is the school district has done more
than an adequate job of running a fair system,'' McCord said. ``I
think it speaks well of the system, the board and the community.''

<TEXT>
   Opponents of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms are
trying to block leading reformers from attending an upcoming
Communist Party conference, a key supporter of the Soviet leader
said today.
   Sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya, a main author of Gorbachev's
reform campaign, spoke about the party battles as Gorbachev
attended a meeting of the leaders of Moscow's Communist Party to
choose delegates for the conference.
   The official news agency Tass said Gorbachev addressed the
meeting, which was opened and closed by Politburo member and Moscow
party head Lev N. Zaikov.
   Details of the speeches or any other debate were not immediately
available. Tass said 319 delegates were chosen to represent the
almost 1 million Communists of Moscow at the conference.
   Zaslavskaya said at a news conference that ``the most pronounced
advocates of `perestroika' were not selected'' in initial elections
for party conference delegates. But Vitaly Korotich, editor of the
weekly Ogonyok, said this week the initial selections might be
revised at today's meeting.
   Tass said all 319 delegates chosen had ``recommended themselves
with concrete deeds as champions of perestroika,'' but did not
mention any names.
   Leading reformers such as Zaslavskaya, economist Abel
Aganbegyan, historian Yuri Afanaseyev, sociologist Fyodor Burlatsky
and economist Gavril Popov received the most votes from party
organizations at their places of work, but were stricken from the
list of potential candidates at the next level, equivalent to
precincts.
   ``Rank and file communists were somehow screened from the
process,'' Zaslavskaya told foreign and Soviet journalists at a
news conference sponsored by the Foreign Ministry.
   Other reformers have told Western reporters this week in Moscow
that they were trying to get their names resinstated at the city
party meeting.
   Similar developments have been reported in other Soviet cities
and regions, although the reports have not been as detailed as for
Moscow.
   Zaslavskaya said opposition to reform came from middle-level
party officials and managers who felt that their power was being
threatened.
   And she denied reports that Politburo member Yegor Ligachev was
leading the conservative movement and would be asked to resign.
   ``Of course the views of Ligachev are not as radical as those of
Gorbachev. But there are no grounds for thinking that he should be
dismissed,'' she said.
   The party conference, which opens on June 28, will be the 19th
of its kind in party history, but the first since 1941.
   The English-language service of Radio Moscow said the conference
of 5,000 delegates ``will discuss the process of perestroika and
ways of promoting it and will map out measures to further
democratize the party and society.''
   Perestroika refers to Gorbachev's efforts to reform the Soviet
economy and society.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Klaus Barbie, the Gestapo chief sentenced to life
in prison for the deportation of French Jews during World War II,
today lost an appeal of his conviction of crimes against humanity.
   Barbie, 74, known as the ``Butcher of Lyon,'' was convicted July
4, 1987 in the southeastern city of Lyon. He was sentenced to life
imprisonment, the maximum possible sentence.
   Defense attorneys had presented 14 separate arguments in their
appeal, but all were rejected by the Criminal Chamber of the
Appeals Court, France's highest court.
   The court followed the recommendation of Advocate General Emile
Robert, who had said that despite two ``regrettable errors'' in the
trial _ both technical _the appeal should be rejected.
   Barbie was found guilty of the roundup and deportation of French
Jews - including 44 children _ to concentration camps in Germany.
He was responsible for deporting the last convoy of 600 people to
leave Lyon in August 1944.
   The appeals court ruling ends five years of legal proceedings
against Barbie that began in February 1983, when he was expelled
from Bolivia, where he was exiled, and brought to France.
   Barbie previously had been convicted of war crimes in absentia
during trials in 1952 and 1952 and was sentenced to death. But the
statute of limitations had run out on those sentences and he was
brought to trial again on charges of crimes against humanity, for
which there is no statute of limitations.
   Barbie is to spend the rest of his life at Lyon's St. Joseph
Prison, unless he is eventually given a pardon for medical reasons.

<TEXT>
   Workers using cutting torches, bulldozers and
a dog resumed their search today for a workman missing since a
2,000-foot television tower collapsed in a heap, killing two other
workers.
   The three employees of Structural System Technology Inc. of
McLean, Va., were working to reinforce the tower, described as one
of the nation's tallest, when it collapsed in calm weather
Thursday, authorities said.
   The first body was found clear of the wreckage immediately after
the accident and the second was pulled out about 7{ hours later,
said Knox County Sheriff Harold Foreman. The search for the third
man was centered in the area where the second body was discovered.
   ``Some of the material is solid steel _ five inches in
diameter,'' said Foreman, who added that investigators had no
indication why the structure fell. ``It's quite heavy.''
   Workers searched until about 3 a.m., using a bloodhound, and
were back at the scene at 9 a.m. An investigator for the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration was at the site.
   The tower, which belonged to KTVO-TV in Kirksville, was erected
in September at a cost of $2.5 million. It was twice as tall as
France's Eiffel Tower, which is 984 feet high.
   A fourth worker, crew foreman Rick Walton, was on the ground
when the structure collapsed.
   ``I saw the whole tower coming down,'' said Walton, who was not
injured. ``It sounded like the worst thunderstorm you ever heard
only a hundred times worse.''
   The structure did not strike any homes in the mainly rural area
of Colony, about 200 miles northwest of St. Louis.
   Jerry Heilman, KTVO's general manager, said the workers had been
replacing structural braces at about the 500-foot level. He said
the station hopes to be back on the air by Saturday or Sunday using
its old transmission tower in Lancaster.
   Heilman said he could not comment on why the tower, less than a
year old, might have needed reinforcement.
   The tower's height, the maximum permitted under Federal Aviation
Administration rules, increased KTVO's potential audience from
40,000 households to about 120,000, said Kurt Sweeney, the
station's news director.
   A 1,909-foot television tower near Coweta, Okla., collapsed
during a severe ice storm Dec. 26. No one was hurt in that
collapse, which engineers said was caused by 500,000 pounds of ice
on the tower.

<TEXT>
   A special committee of the 1.7 million-member
United Church of Christ announced today that it will recommend the
church move its national headquarters from New York to Cleveland.
   More than a year ago the executive council of the United Church
suggested that headquarters be moved to St. Louis, but changed its
recommendation and said only that the headquarters be moved out of
New York by 1991.
   The recommendation came a year after the church's 16th General
Synod delayed selection of a site and decided that a special
committee should resolve the issue.
   The decision won't become final until the church's next synod in
Fort Worth, Tex., in 1989, said public relations coordinator Martha
Gotwals.
   In a news release today, the 12-member committee said many
factors led to the choice of Cleveland, ``including the mission of
the church and its priorities, the continuing commitment to
ecumenical relationship, stewardship and cost factors, the strong
and diverse presence of the United Church of Christ, quality of
life issues and demographics.''
   The move could mean as many as 310 new jobs for Cleveland, and
some members of the New York staff are expected to transfer, Ms.
Gotwals said. Some of the church's leases in New York expire in
1989, she said.
   Ms. Gotwals said the church hasn't selected a specific location
for the new headquarters but that a site will be chosen before the
synod meets June 29, 1989.
   The church's executive council had considered Cleveland,
Chicago, Louisville, Ky., Indianapolis, New York and St. Louis.

<HEAD>Jackson Calls for Outlawing AIDS Discrimination</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 6 grafs with Jackson comments on AIDS, picking

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson called today for immediate
federal action to stop discrimination against victims of the deadly
disease AIDS.
   Jackson, in a campaign statement distributed to reporters,
praised a draft report issued Thursday by the chairman of the White
House AIDS commission, and he said the government should quickly
heed the report's recommendation of strong federal
anti-discrimination protection.
   ``The Reagan-Bush administration must act now to stop
discrimination against people with AIDS in all areas, including
employment, housing and insurance,'' Jackson said.
   ``The president must take every available step, including an
executive order, to stop discrimination now, and the Congress must
legislate strong new laws to protect confidentiality and rights.''
   ``We cannot wait to commit more resources,'' he said. ``All
presidential candidates must agree that we need to spend what is
necessary to meet the challenge. We cannot wait to lead our nation
away from discrimination and fear-mongering. All leaders must speak
out now.''
   Jackson's comments were released just before he left for a
one-day foray into New Mexico and Montana today before returning to
California for the finale of his Democratic presidential campaign.
His campaign manager insisted: ``We're gaining.''
   The two small states and New Jersey join California in closing
out the Democratic primary season with elections on Tuesday.
   After spending much of Thursday talking to gang members and
urging local authorities to address the root problems of gang
violence, Jackson took his upbeat message to a housing project in
heavily Hispanic East Los Angeles, and then headed to a peace rally
in Los Angeles.
   Along the way, he picked up some words of praise _ but not an
official endorsement _ from Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who said
he would keep his voting preference in the privacy of the voting
booth.
   Jackson appeared relaxed and jovial despite the growing
inevitability that he will lose the nomination to front-runner
Michael Dukakis.
   Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, acknowledged Thursday
that Jackson faces an uphill battle to win Californoa's primary on
Tuesday, a fact reflected in polls showing Dukakis with an
overwhelming lead in the state.
   But Austin said he believes Jackson has ``some momentum now,''
adding: ``We're gaining.''
   ``But we've got a long ways to go,'' Austin admitted. ``We've
got our job cut our for us to turn our people out'' to vote.
   That goal has been reflected in Jackson's speeches here as he
tells supporters that their votes do count and that they should not
be swayed by reports that Dukakis all but has the nomination
wrapped up.
   His campaign has begun a $700,000 television advertising blitz
for the final days of the California campaign, which will include a
$150,000, half-hour broadcast at 8 p.m. on Monday, election eve.
   The show will be not only an appeal for votes but also a
``closing statement for the campaign,'' that will feature an upbeat
``celebration of the year'' of campaigning, Austin said.
   It will feature footage of Jackson's campaign, and an interview
with the candidate by a yet-unnamed celebrity, he said. Jackson
also will make a closing statement to viewers.
   Jackson and Bradley met privately at City Hall and then convened
a meeting with six gang members and various representatives of city
and county agencies.
   The meeting at City Hall was added to Jackson's schedule after
Dukakis canceled a scheduled debate in the Los Angeles suburb of
Torrance because his wife was having delicate spinal surgery today.
   Bradley said that Jackson's meeting with gang members that
morning in a Watts housing project _ where Jackson also had spent
the night _ provided ``one more item of impetus'' to city efforts
against gang problems.
   ``I will commit to bring together resources ... to deal with
what is an urgent problem in our society and our city,'' the mayor
said.
   Without officially endorsing his fellow black politican, Bradley
said Jackson had run a ``thoroughly remarkable campaign,'' and had
``energized millions of people'' across the country.
   ``I commend you for what you have done in showing what is
possible for this country,'' the mayor told Jackson.

<TEXT>
   A 5-year-old boy returned to school today
and resumed shouting Bible verses, drawing yet another suspension
on the last day of classes for preaching and refusing to enter
school.
   Matthew Strode was on campus at Eastfield Elementary School for
about 20 minutes before he was suspended, said Assistant Principal
Shirley Ramsey.
   The boy's brother, Duffey, 11, whose own suspension ran through
today, stood outside the school gate, joining Matthew in his
preaching.
   On Thursday, school officials had breathed a sigh of relief when
Matthew and his sister failed to return to school after their
latest 10-day suspension.
   ``It was good to have a nice quiet morning,'' David Ricketts,
superintendent of McDowell County Schools, said Thursday.
   Before today, Matthew and his sister, Pepper, 6, had been
suspended four times for defying school authorities and breaking
school rules by preaching, or in Pepper's case standing, outside
Eastfield Elementary after being asked to enter the building.
   Today's suspension, on the last day of school, was for one day.
   The children's father, David Strode, had said Thursday that he
saw no need to send his children to school because arrangements had
been made for them to take their final tests today.
   ``My father in heaven will take care of us,'' Strode said.
   When Strode took Duffey back to school May 27, there were two
altercations with protesting parents. The parents gave him with a
petition of 474 signatures calling for him to stop his children
from preaching.
   Duffey told reporters Thursday he expects to preach somewhere
during the summer. ``I just like preaching the daily word,'' he
said.
   ``The children have had enough preaching in two months to fill
their bellies for a lifetime,'' Strode said. ``The people who have
rejected it have sealed their doom to an everlasting fire.''
   School officials Thursday positioned sheriff's deputies at the
top of the driveway and instructed parents to drop off their
children and leave the campus immediately. Reporters also were
restricted to certain areas of the grounds.
   School officials have said the preaching is in reaction to
Duffey's suspension in April after a scuffle with some other
children.
   ``I think Mr. Strode had an ax to grind with the school
system,'' Ricketts said. ``He chose this way to do it.''
   Strode has said he is building a house on the west side of town,
so the children probably will go to a different school when classes
resume in August. The Strodes claim a constitutional right to
preach on school grounds.

<TEXT>
   A bomb hidden in a trash bin
exploded today outside a bank, killing four people and injuring 19,
police said. It was the deadliest bombing in South Africa in more
than a year.
   The lunch-hour blast went off at 1:30 p.m. outside a branch of
the Standard Bank in Roodepoort, a city bordering the west side of
Johannesburg. Three black men and a white woman were killed.
   The explosion followed four other bombings in the past two weeks
which authorities have blamed on the African National Congress
guerrilla movement.
   The ANC had no immediate comment on the bombing, but issued a
statement from its headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, saying the month
of June ``must be a period of united and decisive popular
offensive'' against the government.
   The statement endorsed a three-day, anti-apartheid protest
scheduled to start on Monday, saying South Africa's economy ``must
grind to a halt'' on those days.
   A Roodepoort police spokesman, Maj. Tiene Halgryn, said eight
people were seriously injured in the explosion, including two
whites and six blacks. He said 11 other people suffered lesser
injuries.
   Police said most of the victims apparently were waiting at a
street corner for a traffic light to change when the explosion
occurred.
   The blast shattered at least a dozen windows in the bank, as
well as windows in nearby stores, and glass was strewn across a
nearby intersection in Roodepoort's central business district.
Police said the explosive device was a small limpet mine, which can
be attached to another object, and they conducted a search for
other bombs after cordoning off the area.
   A majority of the bombings blamed on the ANC have involved
limpet mines. Posters in government buildings around the country
show pictures of these devices and encourage members of the public
to be on the lookout for them.
   The death toll from today's explosion was the highest from a
bombing in South Africa since four white policemen were killed by a
car bomb outside a Johannesburg courthouse in May 1987.
   It was the fifth bombing reported in the Johannesburg-Pretoria
area in a nine-day span. Only one of the other blasts caused
injuries _ a mine placed in a flower box in Pretoria which exploded
May 26, injuring four white women.
   Police have blamed the blasts on the outlawed ANC, which has
waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 as part of its
efforts to topple the white-controlled government. The ANC has
neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the recent bombings.
   Today's ANC statement said the group had distributed leaflets in
South Africa endorsing the nationwide protest planned Monday
through Wednesday by anti-apartheid labor unions, church groups and
other activists.
   The groups organizing the protest in South Africa are prohibited
by law from promoting a general strike, but it is expected that the
protest will take that form. Government officials and employers
have warned that workers who participate face dismissal or legal
action.
   The protest is intended to oppose the bannings of major
anti-apartheid organizations and other government moves against
opposition trade unions, newspapers and individual activists.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Fire leveled the main hangar and
destroyed six planes today at Shafter Airport, the site of man's
first human-powered flight more than a decade ago.
   The planes, including one antique, were worth an estimated $2
million, Kern County Fire Capt. Geoff Willford said. The dollar
amount of damage to the hangar itself had not been determined.
   Shafter Airport, surrounded by farms in the fertile San Joaquin
Valley 125 miles north of Los Angeles, was the scene in 1977 of the
first successful attempt to fly a human-powered plane around a
mile-long figure eight course.
   The pedal-powered plane, dubbed the Gossamer Condor, was
designed by Paul McCready of Pasadena and piloted by Bryan Allen of
Tulare. Their effort won an $87,500 prize from the Royal
Aeronautical Society of London.
   The fire broke out about 5 a.m., sending up a cloud of smoke
that could be seen for 20 miles.
   Willford said the roof of the main hangar collapsed, leaving
only smoldering rubble. No injuries were reported.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater played
tourist Friday at President Reagan's final stop in Britain, donning
a black derby hat adorned with a band of Union Jacks and the word
``London.''
   ``This tops them all,'' Fitzwater told reporters as he briefly
modeled the hat at Winfield House, the residence of U.S. Ambassador
Charles H. Price II, just before Reagan addressed a crowd of
several hundred embassy employees and their families.
   The derby was a present from Tom Griscom, the White House
communications director, who pulled it out of a shopping bag and
laughed as Fitzwater put it on.
   Didn't they have a bigger one, shouted one of the reporters,
noting the somewhat tight fit on portly Fitzwater's bald pate.
   ``That was the largest _ he'll have to shrink his head,''
retorted Griscom.
   Was the derby a symbol of the new Anglo-American relationship?
   ``That's right,'' laughed Fitzwater, ``we'll go to any lengths.''

   The number of AIDS cases reported to the World
Health Organization stood at 96,433 by May 31, including 7,387 new
cases registered in 75 countries since the beginning of the year.
   Updated reports from the United States, France, Italy, Canada
and Haiti accounted for 78 percent of the recorded 1988 increase,
according to figures released this week.
   The U.S. AIDS total stood at 61,580 cases, including 4,348 new
victims from January through April.
   France trailed the United States as the country with the second
highest number of cases, 3,628. They included 555 new cases during
the first quarter of the year.
   Brazil had the third highest overall total with 2,956 cases.
Brazil reported 206 new cases from January through April. That
compared with 1,361 new cases in all of 1987.
   Other countries that showed disproportionately high increases
included Haiti, with 231 new cases through April. In all of last
year, Haiti reported just 331 cases. Italy recorded 387 new cases,
and Canada had 232.
   The United States had the highest case rate among all
industrialized countries with 8.5 AIDS victims per 100,000 people.
France had a rate of 3.3, Australia, 2.1, and Canada 1.9.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   It said the boat ``Susan,'' flying a Honduran flag, was seized
Thursday close to the Israeli shore.
   Police detained all six sailors aboard, nationals of Turkey,
Somalia, Honduras, Sudan and Lebanon, for questioning.
   The Israeli news agency Itim reported that about 100 automobile

<HEAD>Herpes Kill Seals and Algae Choke Fish: Pollution Suspected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK POWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An epidemic of a herpes virus has
killed hundreds of seals in Danish and German waters, and
researchers believe it may be linked to pollution.
   Pollution also may be behind an explosive growth of algea that
has choked tons of Norwegian fish, according to researchers.
   Biologists diagnosed the herpes virus in the dead harp seals on
Wednesday. They had been baffled for two weeks by the mysterious
deaths of seal pups and by spontaneous abortions.
   ``We are relieved that it turned out to be an epidemic, but
worried because there might be environmental causes behind it,''
Peder Agger, head of the state Forestry and Nature Agency, said
Thursday.
   ``We fear that the seal kill was caused by pollution. And if
that is the case, then our picture of generally deplorable
conditions is backed up,'' Agger was quoted as saying in the
Jyllands-Posten newspaper.
   No source of the pollution has been pinpointed to explain the
sudden increase in casualties of marine life. About 400 dead seals
have been found in Danish waters and another 50 on West Germany's
North Sea coastline.
   In addition, an increasing number of dab fish have been found
suffering from canker sores. Up to every fifth dab examined was
diseased, according to the Jyllands-Posten report.
   ``All signs point to a breakdown in the ecological balance in
Danish waters,'' said Jens Kampmann, head of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   At a special meeting of the West German parliament Wednesday,
Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer called for international action
to help cut waste dumping in the seas because of ``strong
suspicions'' it is threatening marine life.
   Experts have warned for 10 years of a ``creeping sea death'' as
a result of steadily growing emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus
from public sewage plants, industry and farms along the coast.
   ``The Germans are worried that environmental complications may
lie behind the seal kills. And for good reason, since there is a
lot of heavy industry in the area,'' Agger said.
   Kampmann said no certain link has been made between the seal
epidemic and the blanket of yellow algae that has spread southward
from the western coasts of Norway and Sweden toward the Baltic.
   Norwegian farmers who breed salmon and trout in seaside pens
lost hundreds of tons of fish as the algae clogged the fish gills
and suffocated them. The algae are harmless to humans.
   Some major fish farms in western Norway towed their pens away
from coastal areas into Norway's deep, cool fiords to avoid the
threat. Denmark's rich fishing grounds so far have been unaffected.
   Norwegian and Danish biologists who were dispatched to North Sea
and Baltic waters recently reported algae concentrations were
dropping significantly.
   The mass of single-celled algae was moving toward the Baltic.
Experts said the upper level of the sea was not salty enough for
the algae to thrive, but they might seek deeper waters and threaten
marine life on the bottom.

<HEAD>Restorer To Smash And Reassemble 2,000-Year-Old Vase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who looks after the pottery and porcelain in
the British Museum is going to break a prize exhibit _ the
2,000-year-old Portland Vase from ancient Rome.
   Art dealers estimate the value of the vase at around $21
million. The 10-inch-high, four-pound glass artifact is regarded as
one of the finest pieces of early Roman glass.
   Nigel Williams, the museum's chief conservator of ceramics, said
the vase must be broken and reassembled because the glue holding
the blue and white cameo-glass pieces together after two earlier
breakages has become yellow and extremely brittle.
   ``It is the most difficult restoration I have attempted in 27
years,'' Williams told reporters at a news conference Wednesday.
   He said he expects the task to occupy about 40 percent of his
time for the rest of this year. He hopes to have the vase back on
display by the end of December.
   It was made by a sculptor named Dioscourides and depicts men and
women in a leafy glade _ probably the courtship of Peleus and the
sea-goddess Thetis, who became the parents of the mythical Greek
warrior, Achilles.
   ``It is one of the very few surviving Roman cameo vases and has
always been the subject of great academic debate as to who is
represented on it,'' said museum spokesman Andrew Hamilton.
   The vase was formed by inserting a gob of cobalt blue glass into
a cup of opaque white glass and then blowing both together. The
white outer layer was then carved to produce the white cameo relief
on a blue background.
   The vase is believed to have belonged to the Emperor Augustus
and was discovered in 1582 in a tomb near Rome.
   It came to Britain in the 18th century via Sir William Hamilton,
the British envoy in Naples and husband of Lady Emma Hamilton,
later the mistress of Adm. Horatio Nelson.
   In 1785, the vase was sold to the wealthy Portland family for
roughly the equivalent of $1,875 dollars in today's money _ a vast
sum in those days. The Duke of Portland loaned it to the British
Museum in 1810.
   While on display in a showcase at the museum, the vase was
deliberately smashed into about 200 pieces on Feb. 7, 1845 by
William Lloyd, an Irishman who had been drinking heavily for a week.
   ``I have no doubt that the man who broke the vase, whoever he
is, is mad,'' the duke replied when the museum wrote to him to
express regret.
   The vase was glued together by the museum's restorer, John
Doubleday, and put on display again.
   Doubleday's glue had become so weak and discolored after a
century that in 1948 the vase was dismantled and rebuilt by
conservator James Axtell, who also incorporated three of the 37
small chips that Doubleday had found too difficult to replace.
   ``I will be using more advanced techniques than were available
to Axtell, including epoxy resin fused by ultraviolet light,'' said
Williams.
   He also intends to replace the 34 glass chips Axtell left out.
   ``The vase should hold together comfortably for another 200
years after that,'' Williams said.

   The Air Force
successfully launched an unarmed Minuteman 3 missile today in a
test of its ability to deliver multiple nuclear warheads to distant
targets, officials said.
   The intercontinental ballistic missile was launched at 6:28
a.m., aimed at Kwajalein Atoll near the Marshall Islands in the
western Pacific Ocean, said Airman 1st Class Ann-Marie Townsend.
   ``The purpose of the launch is to test and evaluate how well the
missile operates,'' said Master Sgt. Bruce Zielsdorf.
   The missile's payload landed on the atoll target about 4,200
miles away roughly 30 minutes after launch, Zielsdorf said.
   It was the 132nd such launch in a series of Strategic Air
Command tests of the Minuteman 3, and the 469th Minuteman launch
overall, Zielsdorf said.

   Violent thunderstorms lashed much of the South and Midwest today
with wind up to 85 mph after a day of stormy weather that included
several tornadoes and large hail.
   Thunderstorms that began Thursday night stretched this morning
from Texas to north-central Oklahoma, from southeast Arkansas to
Mississippi and from Louisiana into Florida, southeast Alabama and
eastern North Carolina.
   Near the southern tip of Texas, a squall line hit South Padre
Island with wind up to 85 mph about 6 a.m., overturning some
trailers, causing minor injuries and blowing roofs off some
buildings there and in Brownsville, the National Weather Service
said.
   Also at Brownsville, wind up to 62 mph overturned some small
airplanes at the airport, and power lines were downed at Skidmore,
the weather service said.
   In the six hours up to 7 a.m., 1.24 inches of rain fell at the
Navy air station at Corpus Christi, Texas, and 1.87 inches was
reported at Port Isabel.
   High wind also blew today in the Northwest, with gusts to 70 mph
on parts of the Oregon coast, as a new storm system approached.
Showers were scattered from northern Idaho to northern California.
   On Thursday, tornadoes touched down in Texas near Cottonwood and
Austin during the afternoon and evening while wind gusted to 70 mph
at Abilene.
   In Spring Lake, N.C., thunderstorm wind gusts blew over signs
and scattered debris across roads.
   Hail up to golf ball size pelted Zephyr and Kelleen, Texas, as
well as Newton Grove, N.C.
   Thursday's violent weather included four tornadoes, five storms
with possible tornadoes, 63 reports of dime-size or larger hail and
19 reports of wind damage or winds of more than 60 mph. While many
of the reports came from Oklahoma and Texas, the list included
North Carolina, Arkansas Mississippi, Alabama, Kansas and Virginia.
There were no reports of injury or major damage.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the southern Plains to the lower Missisippi Valley, the
Tennessee Valley, northern sections of the central Gulf Coast
states and Georgia, and the Carolinas; and scattered rain from the
central Appalachians to the upper Ohio Valley and the lower Great
Lakes, and from northern California to the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s and 80s across much
of the nation; in the 60s from northern Wisconsin to the Ohio
Valley and the mid- Atlantic states; in the 50s from much of New
England into southern New York and northern Pennsylvania; into the
90s from the central Gulf Coast to northern Florida, from the
Southern California valleys and southern Nevada into the Rio Grande
Valley; and between 100 and 110 degrees across the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 32

<HEAD>South Korea Proposes New Talks With North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government proposed new talks with
communist North Korea, and thousands of radical students declared
Friday they will march to the demilitarized zone in an effort to
force unification of the peninsula.
   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae wrote a letter to North Korea
proposing discussions, possibly this month, about the Olympic Games
scheduled for Seoul in September and other pending issues. It was
read on the radio Friday.
   Later in the day, 3,000 students from 18 schools held a campus
rally in Seoul in support of a march next Friday to the village of
Panmunjom to meet with North Korean students on national
reunification.
   ``Let's go and meet the northern people after driving out all
foreign forces!'' a speaker told the rally at Kyonghee University
in eastern Seoul. Students cheered and applauded.
   Officials said they would not permit the march because it was a
violation of the National Security Law and would be propaganda for
North Korea.
   Panmunjom is 35 miles north of Seoul, in the 2{-mile-wide
demilitarized zone that separates the Koreas, and is off-limits to
civilians.
   Lee Jong-nam, the prosecutor general, warned against
``left-leaning'' student activism and ordered a crackdown on
illegal campus activity favoring the North.
   At the rally, students shouted ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Let's
go to Panmunjom!''
   Giant posters showed students destroying U.S. flags and routing
U.S. troops. The United States has 42,000 soldiers in South Korea.
   Most campus rallies reported Friday were peaceful, but one at
Dankook University in Seoul turned violent when 50 students fought
police, hurling firebombs and rocks. Riot squads countered with
tear gas.
   Lee, the prime minister, wrote the letter proposing talks to
Premier Lee Gun Mo of North Korea. Chung Han-mo, the culture and
information minister, read it on radio.
   ``I respectfully propose talks between high-level authorities of
South and the North Korea to speedily dispel the mistrust that is
now standing in the way of peaceful unification,'' it said.
   South Korean officials said they told the North on Tuesday they
would deliver the letter to Panmunjom on Friday, but the North
Koreans refused to receive it.
   Korea has been divided since in 1945 and there has been a sharp
rise recently in public support for reunification, spurred by
President Roh Tae-woo's promise of full democracy.
   Radical students have demanded that North Korea be made co-host
of the Olympics and that the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea
withdraw. They claim the United States is reponsible for partition.
   South Koreans generally mistrust the North Korean regime of Kim
Il Sung, however, and support the U.S. military presence. They fear
another North Korean invasion like the one in 1950 that started a
three-year war.
   Lee's letter said the talks could be held either in Seoul or
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and should occur ``at an early
date, preferably within June.'' Delegations sides would consist of
about five officials each and be led by a Cabinet minister, he said.
   If held, the talks would would be the first contact since North
Korea suspended dialogue in the spring of 1986, citing joint
U.S.-South Korea military exercises.
   Among topics Lee suggested were North Korean participation in
the Olympics, exchanges of people and reactivating channels of
dialogue suspended in 1986.
   North Korea has promoted its own proposal for political talks,
to be attended by 50 politicians from each side. South Korea has
called that an ``unrealistic political offensive.''
   Opposition leaders have urged Roh's government to make
concessions as a means of persuading the North Koreans to
participate in the Olympics.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the games unless it is
co-host. The International Olympic Committee and South Korea
rejected the demand.

<TEXT>
   Local officials are balking at sending a
woman whose daughter killed three people and wounded seven others
in a shooting rampage to a national convention for families of
mentally ill people.
   The decision by the Delaware County Office of Mental Health has
upset the local chapter of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill, which
wants $800 to send Ruth Seegrist to its national gathering in
Boulder, Colo., over the July Fourth weekend. The alliance is a
self-help group for families of the mentally ill.
   Mrs. Seegrist's daughter, Sylvia, was convicted in the October
1985 shootings at Springfield Mall in this Philadelphia suburb.
Sylvia Seegrist has a history of mental illness.
   County Mental Health Director Diane Bricker said Thursday the
expenditure would be difficult to justify because she believes Mrs.
Seegrist could afford to pay her own way.
   Mrs. Seegrist, or anyone else the alliance would want to send,
would have to pass a screening for financial need before the county
would spend the money, Ms. Bricker said.
   ``I have already told my own staff they can't go because the
system is too impoverished,'' Ms. Bricker said. ``I could name you
a hundred people who would like to go to that conference, many of
whom are willing to pay their own way.''
   County AMI President Joy McCoy claims the county is
discriminating against Mrs. Seegrist. She said Mrs. Seegrist's
finances shouldn't be a factor in the decision.
   Ms. McCoy said Philadelphia, Montgomery and Chester counties are
sending four AMI representatives each to the conference.

   A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee concluded today that it does not have enough evidence to
determine whether a relatively new and popular type of birth
control pill causes more non-cancerous cysts than older,
single-dose pills.
   However, the FDA's fertility and maternal health drugs panel
said it supported the post-market studies that the agency has
already instructed the three makers of the new pills to undertake.
   Dr. Ridgely C. Bennett of the FDA said the agency will work with
the companies on those studies and is also planning a larger study
of the pills involving California Medicaid recipients.
   The Los Angeles physician whose chemical observations played a
major role in prompting today's advisory committee meeting declined
to comment specifically on the panel's action.
   But Dr. James C. Caillouette said he remains personally
convinced that the single-dose pills are safer than the triphasic
versions, which come in three different colors denoting their
different dose levels. A woman taking such a prescription would
take one color pill on certain days of the month and the other
colors on other days.
   ``I still have strong feelings that we have pills that in my
experience are safer than the multiphasics,'' said Caillouette.
   Technically, the multiphasics include some products that mix two
dosage levels rather than three, but Caillouette said he is mainly
concerned with the ``triphasics'' rather than the ``biphasics.''
   The FDA instructed the three companies to conduct so-called
Phase 4 studies in letters sent out last December. There is no
indication when they will be completed.
   Concern that the multiphasics could be contributing to cysts has
bubbled to the surface since Caillouette noticed a rash of the
growths on his patients a little over two years ago.
   ``This absolutely blew my mind,'' he said in a recent interview.
``I thought something awful was happening to me. Every time I went
into an examining room, I had a patient with ovarian cyst.''
   Eventually, he concluded there must be a connection between the
outbreak of cysts and the new birth control pills he had been
prescribing for the women.
   Sold by three of the six major U.S. pharmaceutical companies
that make birth control pills, the multiphasic pills went on the
market in 1984. They were not new chemical formulations, but rather
new combinations of existing drugs in various strengths.
   Caillouette said introduction of the pills was accompanied by an
aggressive marketing program. By 1987, he said, nine of every 10
new birth control prescriptions were for multiphasics.
   The rationale given by drug companies for developing the
multiphasic pills was to minimize any side-effects by providing the
lowest total dosage possible consistent with effective birth
control.
   But Caillouette, who was presenting his views to the FDA today,
says he believes the decision was driven by business considerations.
   He says the companies' patents on the single-dose pills were
about to expire and that less expensive, generic versions were
about to become available. He believes the companies were looking
for products just different enough to win new patents so they could
push sales of those ``new'' products rather than compete with the
cheaper generics.
   Representatives for the three companies _ Ortho Pharmaceutical
Corp., Wyeth Laboratories Inc. and Syntex Corp. _ all denied in
separate telephone interviews any improprieties and said they were
cooperating with FDA-ordered reviews.
   Studies involving thousands of women have led experts to
conclude that taking birth control pills actually reduces the
chances of a woman developing ovarian cysts.
   That is why Caillouette was so surprised when it dawned on him
in early 1986 that each of seven patients who had developed cysts
during the previous four months had been taking multiphasic pills.
   When he put them back on single-dosage birth control pills, he
said, ``the cysts went away and I thought, `This is what is
supposed to happen.' But something is going on with these phasic
pills.''
   Caillouette, who also is a professor at the University of
Southern California School of Medicine, presented seven case
studies during a West Coast medical meeting ``and following my
presentation, physicians got up from the audience and presented an
additional 11 cases.''
   He published his findings in a medical journal last summer and
began getting still more calls and letters from other physicians
and patients having similar experiences.
   Caillouette said he now knows of 68 cases in which there is a
potential link between multiphasic pills and functional cysts.

<HEAD>Woman Charged in Child Abuse Death Reportedly Has Brain Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The longtime lover of a lawyer charged with
beating to death the couple's 6-year-old ward has suffered brain
damage from repeated beatings, New York Newsday reported Friday.
   Prosecutors building a murder case against Joel Steinberg said
they doubt they will call Hedda Nussbaum, who lived with Steinberg
for 17 years, to testify against him, even though she is willing,
the newspaper said.
   They are concerned that even if she is capable of appearing in
court, she she would fall under Steinberg's influence again, the
newspaper quoted law enforcement sources as saying.
   ``It's not clear how she will react when she sees Steinberg
again,'' one source said. ``She believed he had supernatural
powers.''
   Prosecutors interviewed Ms. Nussbaum last month at a private
psychiatric hospital.
   Ms. Nussbaum, who also was arrested but not indicted in the
death of Lisa Steinberg, has undergone plastic surgery to repair
the visible damage of repeated beatings.
   ``She did suffer brain damage. So far, it is limited to her
being unable to come up with some words when she's talking. She
forgets certain words or names,'' a source close to the case told
the newspaper.
   Her attorney, Barry Scheck, said recently that his client is
willing to testify against Steinberg, but refused to detail what
she would say. Scheck declined comment Thursday.
   Steinberg's attorney, Ira D. London, said he may call Ms.
Nussbaum as a witness if she isn't called for the prosecution.
   Sources also told the newspaper that Ms. Nussbaum, 45, probably
will not be prosecuted for Lisa's death.
   Ms. Nussbaum and Steinberg were arrested Nov. 2 after police
found Lisa unconscious in their Greenwich Village apartment. The
child died a short time later of a head injury.
   A grand jury indicted Steinberg, 47, on charges of second-degree
murder, first-degree manslaughter and two counts of endangering the
welfare of a minor, along with drug and weapon charges. He is in
jail at Rikers Island.

<HEAD>Napping Reptile Goes Unnoticed at Plant Entrance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE MARY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of workers walked past a snoozing,
7-foot alligator into a factory before people inside finally
noticed it through a window and called for help.
   ``No one outside even noticed it was there,'' said Steve Morgan
of Stromberg-Carlson Corp., which makes telephone switching
equipment in this Orlando suburb.
   The alligator, who either walked from a retention pond neaby or
from Lake Mary about two miles away, chose a flower bed next to the
plant entrance for his nap Thursday. About 600 employees used an
alternate entrance for about 1{ hours while a state wildlife
officer tried to rope the reptile.
   Dayton Hudson finally roped the beast and taped its mouth shut.
The alligator then was shipped to a trapper, who killed it for its
meat and hide. Under state regulations, an alligator that shows no
fear of humans is considered a threat and must be destroyed.

   Fingers are snapping but feet are
staying firmly planted on the ground in Nicholasville, where police
are enforcing an ordinance that bans public dancing without a
license.
   ``I stood there and cried,'' said Boots Nelson, a patron at the
Next Door Saloon who wasn't allowed to dance when a band played her
favorite song. ``The band was playing their hearts out, but people
were afraid to tap their feet for fear the law would come in.''
   Handmade ``No Dancing'' signs were posted in the bar after
police last week cited owner Billy Davis for violating the
ordinance. Officials said it was apparently the first time the
ordinance had been enforced.
   ``This is not a point where the city is trying to stop
dancing,'' Police Chief Carl Perkins said Friday. ``We're living in
the '80s like everyone else does.''
   But officials say the ordinance applies to dancing everywhere,
including parking lots and playgrounds.
   Last weekend, some square dancers who wanted to kick up their
heels to a band playing in a restaurant parking lot were asked to
refrain.
   And three clog dancers who appeared at a city commission budget
meeting Thursday to ask permission to clog next weekend were told
they would have to wait for a meeting of the full commission later
this month.
   Mayor James Mason told the cloggers the commission was ``boxed
in'' by the ordinance. ``I think it is sad, but we cannot vote on
it,'' he said.
   Commissioner Joe Daugherty said he thought the law was unfair
and that the commission would vote to change it.
   Perkins said police have begun enforcing the law in the city of
10,000 people because bars that have live bands may not meet city
and state fire codes. He said the intent of the ordinance was
safety.
   Davis is to appear in court June 13.

   A 20-year-old man wounded when a
babysitter went on a shooting spree said today he talked the woman
into giving up one of her guns after she broke into his home, but
then she shot him in the chest with another pistol.
   Philip Andrew described for the first time what happened in his
parents Winnetka home when Laurie Dann burst in two weeks ago after
she killed one child and wounded five others at a nearby elementary
school.
   Andrew spoke at a news conference at Highland Park Hospital,
where he has been a patient since the shooting on May 20.
   ``This was a sick individual. You can't make sense of it _
that's how you make sense of it. The rest of the people who come
into my house aren't going to be shooting at me. It was a freak
incident,'' Andrew said.
   When Ms. Dann burst into the Andrew home the morning of May 20
after opening fire at Hubbard Woods Elementary School, she told
Andrew and his mother she had been sexually assaulted and had shot
her assailant.
   Andrew said he and his mother tried to calm Ms. Dann and
encouraged her to call the police. He said his mother left to warn
her daughters to stay out of the house and that he persuaded Ms.
Dann to give him one of her two pistols.
   But, he said, she clung to the other, a .32-caliber. She grew
fearful that police were approaching, suddenly turned and shot him
in the chest, Andrew said. He staggered out of the house and
collapsed in the driveway.
   Later, as police surrounded his family's house in the posh
suburb, Ms. Dann killed herself.
   Although Andrew and another of Ms. Dann's shooting victims
remain hospitalized, a third victim, Peter Munro, 8, was released
Thursday night from Highland Park Hospital, said spokeswoman Sue
Masaraccia.
   Police are continuing to investigate Ms. Dann's background and
say that an experimental drug she was using can cause suicidal
depression and is not approved for sale in this country.
   Ms. Dann obtained clomipramine, also known as Anafrail, from a
Canadian pharmacy using a Chicago psychiatrist's prescription,
Winnetka Police Lt. Joe Sumner said Thursday.
   Blood tests taken in an autopsy on Ms. Dann showed traces of the
drug, used to control some behavior problems.
   High dosages of Anafrail can cause suicidal depression in some
patients, said Dr. Robert DeVito, a pyschiatrist at Loyola
University Medical Center in suburban Maywood.
   However, DeVito said that he didn't think the drug caused Ms.
Dann's behavior. ``It is not a homicidal drug by any means,'' he
said.
   Ms. Dann, 30, was seeing Dr. John Griest, a psychiatrist in
Madison, Wis., where she once lived. He is authorized to dispense
Anafrail on a trial basis, but police said he only prescribed
lithium carbonate, a drug commonly used for treatment of
manic-depressive disorders, for Ms. Dann.
   Griest cannot comment on Ms. Dann's case due to doctor-patient
confidentiality, said Lauren Cnare, a spokesman at the Madison
clinic. ``We are involved in clinical trials of Anafrail,'' Ms.
Cnare said.
   Winnetka police apparently know the psychiatrist who supplied
Ms. Dann with Anafrail, but have not yet interviewed him, the
Chicago Tribune reported today.
   Officials at the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation
also were investigating how she got the drug, spokesman Steve
Waters said.
   Ciba-Geigy Corp., which makes Anafrail, has been selling the
drug outside the United States for the treatment of people
suffering from ``obsessive-compulsive disorders,'' company
spokeswoman Gloria Martini said.
   The drug also is used to check ``repetitive thoughts of random
violence,'' she said.
   Ms. Dann exhibited various symptoms of the disorder. Residents
of an apartment complex in Madison where she once lived said she
often rode the elevator for hours.
   Tests of the drug are being conducted in the United States with
government approval on 1,300 adult patients at 21 sites around the
country.

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday freed
seven people, including two opposition members of Parliament, who
were held in prison without trial for seven months.
   The freed legislators were Tan Seng Giaw, vice chairman of the
opposition Democratic Action Party and Vethamuthu David, a party
Central Committee member, party member Madhavan Nair told The
Associated Press.
   Nair, who is a state Assembly member, identified the other five
as: Suhaimi Said, legal adviser to the opposition Pan-Malaysian
Islamic Party; Christian church worker Cecilia Ng; Lim Chin Chin, a
lecturer at a local university; and two Chinese educators, Lim Fong
Seng and Seng Maw Yu.
   The seven were among 109 people detained in October and November
of 1987 under the federal Internal Security Act, which allows the
government to imprison people indefinitely without bringing them to
trial.
   The 109 were taken into custody after Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad accused them of raising issues that could stir racial
tensions.
   The government cited the same reason for closing the
English-language Star daily newspaper, the Chinese-language Sin
Chew Jit Poh daily, and the Malay biweekly Watan in October 1987.
They were allowed to reopen earlier this year.
   The prime minister said at the time that he wanted to prevent
riots between Malays and Chinese such as those in 1969 that left
500 people dead. About 50 percent of the population is Malay and 30
percent Chinese.
   The government began releasing some of the 109 detainees on Nov.
20, 1987. No reason was given for the latest release, which left
about 30 of the original 109 still in prison.
   During past releases, the government has said the detainees it
was freeing no longer posed a threat to national security.

<HEAD>Decision To Hire Male YWCA Director Sparks National Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision by the YWCA's Tacoma chapter to
hire a male executive director in defiance of national organization
rules has set off debate over the future of the 133-year-old
organization.
   Last month, Alan Tiger, 36, of Eugene, Ore., was hired as
executive director. By definition, an executive director must be a
full voting member of the YWCA, but the organization's constitution
allows men only as associate, non-voting members.
   Tiger's hiring could result in the national organization
terminating its affiliation with the Tacoma chapter. And the
decision will set a precedent for the YWCA, said Marilynne Keyser,
a YWCA national board member.
   On Thursday, she and national Executive Director Gwendolyn
Calvert Baker fly to Tacoma to meet with chapter leaders to discuss
the issue.
   ``I think _ this is pure conjecture _ that the national has
simply lost touch with what's happening on a local level,'' said
Pene Modahl, president of the Tacoma board of directors.
   ``We believe here in Tacoma that men and women can work
together. We don't believe we're going to lose our focus by hiring
the best possible candidate, who happened to be a man,'' she said.
   Tiger said the Tacoma YWCA will remain committed to the battered
women's shelter, the job training programs and the other services
aimed primarily at women.
   ``We have to ask ourselves, when in the women's movement do we
stop talking about men and women and start to talk about
humanity,'' he said.
   However, some members say accepting men as full members may
shift the YWCA's focus away from women's concerns.
   ``We are working to reverse previous years of discrimination. We
are an organization to promote women, and provide a place for women
to learn to be powerful,'' said Barbara Dixon, executive secretary
of the Salem, Ore., YWCA. In that chapter, five of 35 board members
quit in May when the board denied membership to a man.
   While the YMCA focuses on health and fitness and allows both
sexes to join, the YWCA plays largely a social service and
political role, Ms. Keyser said.
   She said the Tacoma chapter's action is sure to be a subject of
debate at the national YWCA convention later this month in Chicago.
   ``We believe there is a need to reaffirm the commitment as an
autonomous women's organization,'' Ms. Keyser said.
   Some members say many of the 400 local chapters are under
pressure to allow men to join, partly because of the recent
inclusion of women in formerly all-male clubs such as Rotary.
   ``To me, it's a natural evolution. It's come to a point in the
1980s that we have to lay aside this us-against-them thing and
start to work together,'' said Gay Littleton, executive director of
the Ogden, Utah, YWCA.
   A few months ago, the Ogden chapter became the first in the
country to be disaffiliated from the national group because it
allowed men to join. Disaffiliation means the Ogden group may be
barred from using the YWCA name or symbol. No final decision on
that issue has been made, said Ms. Littleton.

   Mayor W. Wilson Goode today named deputy
commissioner Willie Williams as the city's new police commissioner,
putting him in charge of a department still recovering from
corruption probes and a confrontation with a radical group.
   Williams, the first black to lead the 6,700 member department,
will replace Kevin Tucker, who resigned last week after 2{ years on
the job.
   Williams, 44, has been a police officer for 24 years, starting
his career as a Fairmount Park guard. Goode said he chose Williams
from among seven candidates suggested by Tucker.
   ``The tenure of Kevin Tucker has represented the turning-around
of this department and the appointment of Willie Williams
represents a continuation of the reform of the department,'' Goode
said at a noon news conference.
   There has been speculation that because of budget cuts, there
would be some layoffs in the police department, and Williams told
reporters ``the patrol force on the street will not be cut. That is
our first priority.''
   Both Williams and Goode said the major task facing the police
department is the fight against drugs.
   Tucker, 47, quit May 26, effective June 10, citing a need to
spend more time with his family. Tucker is former head of the local
Secret Service office.
   Tucker took over a morale-shattered department reeling from
extortion convictions against 34 officers or former officers,
including a deputy commissioner.
   Tucker succeeded Gregore Sambor, who resigned after a fatal May
1985 confrontation between police and MOVE in which the radical
group's building was bombed by a police helicopter. The bombing
sparked a fire that destroyed dozens of houses.
   Goode has praised Tucker's work as commissioner, saying he
``turned the department around and it is now going in the right
direction. The job of the next police commissioner will be made
much easier by the job he has done.''
   Goode, asked if appointing a black police commissioner would
help the image of police in the black community, responded that
``race was never a factor in this appointment. ... I only sought to
find the very best person.''
   He said, however, that Williams will be able to turn around
negative views of police in the black community, which comprises
about 40 percent of the city's population.

   President Karoly Nemeth, who recently

the state news agency MTI reported Friday.
   The agency said Nemeth has been on sick leave since Wednesday
and his duties will be performed by Vice President Rezsoe
Trautmann. It did not give any further details.
   At the end of the Communist Party conference May 20-22, Nemeth
was dropped from the Communist Party's 108-member Central
Committee. He later lost his post in the ruling Politburo when it
shrank from 13 to 11 members.
   Nemeth, 66, was named president in June 1987.

   A man who police estimated snatched 1,000

   District Judge John Mendoza sentenced Willie Ormond, 34, of Las
Vegas to the maximum 10 years in prison Thursday on a grand larceny
charge. He ordered that the sentence run consecutive to another
10-year term imposed a day earlier by District Judge Robert Rose in
another grand larceny case.
   Officers estimate Ormond stole more than 1,000 purses a year at
casinos.
   ``According to a reliable informant, Willie averages three to
four purse snatches a night, five nights a week,'' Metro Police Lt.
Steve Raeder said.
   Ormond's arrest sheet shows 58 felony and 88 misdemeanor
arrests. Police said he has spent 6.8 years in prison on 36

   John Demjanjuk, who was sentenced to death by
an Israeli court for being a brutal Nazi guard, has been charged by
an Italian court with committing war crimes in Italy, an Israeli
attorney said.
   The retired Ohio autoworker was advised of the Italian charge in
an official letter sent to him at his maximum security jail cell in
the Ayalon Prison near Tel Aviv, attorney Doron Beckerman said in
an interview Thursday.
   The letter said Demjanjuk had been charged with ``voluntary and
continuous aggravated homicide'' in Trieste, Italy, during the
years 1943-1945. It was signed by the Criminal Examination Office
in Trieste.
   On April 18, a three-judge panel convicted Demjanjuk, 68, of
being the brutal Nazi guard ``Ivan the Terrible,'' who operated gas
chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in
Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942 and 1943. He was sentenced to hang.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker who lived in
the Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills before being extradited to
Israel, claims he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity. He
said he will appeal the conviction.
   During the yearlong trial in Israel, testimony was submitted
that Demjanjuk was posted to Trieste after Treblinka was closed
down in August 1943.
   The Israeli weekly Haolom Haze published a copy of the Italian
letter and said Demjanjuk turned it over to his Israeli attorney,
Yoram Sheftel.
   Beckerman, Sheftel's law partner, said Sheftel could not be
reached because he was out of the country.
   A prosecutor in Trieste declined to comment Friday.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush spent a half-hour
today with Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who is
hospitalized at Walter Reed Army Medical Center with stomach and
liver cancer.
   Bush ``wished Duarte well and expressed his gratitude for what
Duarte's done for democracy,'' a spokeswoman for the vice
president, Kristin Taylor, said.
   Bush arrived at Andrews Air Force Base late this morning,
following a week's stay at his Maine vacation home, and then
immediately boarded a helicopter for the short trip to Walter Reed.
   Duarte, one of the United States' staunchest allies in Latin
America, remains in guarded but stable condition as his doctors
review test results to determine how best to treat the stomach and
liver cancer, the hospital said in a statement today.
   The hospital said that doctors at Walter Reed and Duarte's
personal physician would look at all the test results and ``present
treatment alternatives to the president and his family.'' The
hospital added that ``no decision on treatment is expected or
required today'' and did not specify when a decision would be made.
   Duarte, 62, entered Walter Reed on Tuesday night. He visited a
special clinic on Thursday for magnetic resonance imaging tests to
determine the extent of his cancer.
   On his return to Walter Reed on Thursday, he spoke briefly with
reporters, telling them, ``I feel well.''
   He later added, ``One thing is assured. I'll fight it out
because I believe in God.''
   In a statement Thursday, Walter Reed said Duarte has a malignant
gastric ulcer and that preliminary tests showed ``some liver
involvement,'' but that no further spread of the cancer had been
detected.
   Duarte's personal physician, Benjamin Interiano, who is from El
Salvador, said Thursday that he is optimistic for Duarte even
though ``it's a very difficult situation, medically speaking. If a
person has decided to fight, I have all hopes.''
   Interiano said he did not know how long the Salvadoran president
would remain hospitalized in the United States. But he described
Duarte's condition as ``very guarded.''
   The magnetic resonance imaging tests, or MRI, were done at the
offices of Magnetic Imaging of Washington. The company uses MRI to
take three-dimensional pictures of soft tissue. The tests can
detect differences in the magnetic fields of tissues that cannot be
seen by X-rays and is useful in detecting cancers.
   Duarte spoke in Spanish and English, with his Spanish remarks
interpreted by Ambassador Ernesto Rivas-Gallont.
   One comment he made in Spanish but did not repeat in English
was: ``I leave a message for my country that they should never lose
the liberty they have now.''
   Duarte's son, Alejandro Duarte, said he did not have any
immediate concerns about the political stability of El Salvador
during his father's absence.
   ``The government is a team,'' he said in remarks translated into
English by the ambassador. ``A team is together, united. Obviously,
fundamental policies won't change.
   ``We still don't know how long the president will be away.
Therefore, we cannot say how his absence will affect the
(long-term) conduct of government.''
   Duarte is in the final year of his five-year term.

   A 12-year-old girl staged a second
sit-down strike to protest Little League orders that she move up to
a higher league, but tearfully gave up her spot on the pitcher's
mound when threatened with arrest.
   As 100 spectators watched, Felicia Lewis, wearing the uniform of
the Allingtown Volunteer Fire Department, was led away by her
parents after local police warned she would be charged with
disturbing the peace if she didn't let the all-girls softball game
resume.
   West Haven Little League officials reiterated Tuesday that
Felicia must move up because she is too old and talented for the
Allingtown Volunteer Fire Department team, where she was assigned
in April at the beginning of her rookie season.
   Felicia, who forced cancellation of a game last week with a
similar protest, says she wants to stay on the Allingtown team,
which is made up of 8- to 12-year-olds, because she has made
friends.
   ``I like my team. I want to play,'' she said Thursday.
   Felicia arrived at the Morse Park ballfield shortly before
Allingtown's game against Brian Place and was greeted by television
crews and a large crowd of parents and children.
   She went to the outfield to shag a few flies with teammates
before the game and went out to the mound and sat down soon after
the game began.
   League officials were prepared for the protest and submitted a
written complaint to police, who ordered Felicia off the field, and
the game was resumed.
   Felicia was drafted by a team in a higher league because she was
such a good player, and under league rules she has to go to that
team.
   The dispute has pitted parents who say the league has gotten too
competitive against parents who say a violation of the rules will
ruin the league for everyone else.
   ``I think you have to take a stand sometime in your life. For
Felicia, this is it. This kid needs all the support she can get,''
said Jean Gollinger, who carried a sign reading, ``I Support
Felicia.''
   Ronald Lewis, Felicia's father, said his daughter has decided to
continue protesting at the four remaining games of the season and
he is considering taking legal action.

   President Junius R. Jayewardene's
party was declared the winner Friday in two regional elections
marred by violence, and Sinhalese extremists killed two candidates
in another election scheduled next week.
   India moved 2,000 more troops to Mullaitivu, a port town in
northeastern Sri Lanka, in a 12-day-old campaign against Tamil
rebel hideouts, military officials said.
   The elections were required under an agreement that India and
Sri Lanka signed last July in hopes of ending a Tamil separatist
war that has taken about 8,000 lives since 1983. India has more
than 50,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka to enforce the pact, which the
largest rebel group rejected.
   Extremists in the Sinhalese ethnic majority say the agreement
makes too many concessions to Tamils and have vowed to kill anyone
who supports it.
   Jayewardene's United National Party won 87 of the 158 seats at
stake in elections Thursday for district councils in western and
central regions, the government Election Department said.
   A three-party Communist alliance won 60 seats, the Moslem
Congress nine and the Liberal Party two, it reported.
   Sinhalese extremists killed two candidates for the the district
council election scheduled for next Thursdy in the southern region
of this tea and spice island off the tip of India.
   One represented Jayewardene's party and the other was from the
Communist alliance, police said.
   Authorities also blamed Sinhalese radicals for at least 75 cases
of arson in the southern province, including five fires set at
government buildings and around telephone and electricity poles.
   At least six people were reported killed Wednesday and Thursday,
among them two policemen and an election worker.
   The attacks are blamed on the People's Liberation Front, a
radical Sinhalese group that has gained strength in southern Sri
Lanka in the past several years.
   Also Friday, the United News of India said the Indian government
reported 18 Indian soldiers killed last Sunday when Tamil fighters
detonated a mine under their truck.
   It said the report of the bombing, one of the deadliest attacks
on Indian forces, apparently was withheld because of a three-day
visit to Sri Lanka by Defense Minister K.C. Pant that ended Tuesday.
   Nine district councils are to be created under the peace
agreement, and the government party won elections for four held in
April. No election dates have been set in the Tamil-dominated north
and east because of the insurgency.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and claim discrimination by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   India became involved in trying to end the war because 60
million Tamils live in its southern Tamil Nadu state.
   The main target of the Indian military campaign is the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which is the largest rebel group
and has not put down its arms.
   At least 480 Indian soldiers have been killed since their
peacekeeping mission began July 30, 1987.

<HEAD>Democratic Front-Runner Dukakis' Wife Kitty Undergoes Surgery</HEAD>

   Surgeons operated for more than five hours today
to relieve dangerous pressure on the spinal column of Kitty
Dukakis, wife of Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis who canceled campaign plans to be with her at the hospital.
   ``Preliminary indications look good,'' hospital spokesman Martin
Bander said after the surgery.
   Dukakis spent the night on an extra bed in his wife's room,
according to spokesman James Dorsey. He spent about 15 minutes this
morning talking to the chief surgeon, Dr. Nicholas T. Zervas,
before the operation began at 7:30 a.m. EDT.
   ``The governor is going to spend the morning at the hospital
working,'' said Dorsey. ``He is going to await the results.''
   Dukakis flew from San Francisco to Boston on Thursday to be with
Mrs. Dukakis. Doctors intended to remove two herniated discs
pressing against her spinal cord in her neck. They expected the
operation to last from two to five hours.
   ``Kitty's feeling fine,'' Dukakis told reporters after the
late-night visit. ``She's in good spirits, looks good and is
anxious to get this over.''
   The Massachusetts governor said he would resume campaigning this
weekend ``if everything is OK.''
   Dukakis said his wife was satisfied the diagnosis explained the
puzzling health problems she had been experiencing. Mrs. Dukakis
had complained of numbness and coldness in her fingers and hands,
and pain in her neck, for about a month.
   ``When she went out walking, she would kind of stumble a little
bit,'' he said. ``So in a sense it's a relief to know this is what
it is.
   ``She started by having this feeling of numbness in her
fingertips. It started spreading to her feet, and now it's getting
to her legs. It's obvious these herniated discs are starting to
press on whatever it is they're pressing on,'' he said.
   Dukakis canceled a planned debate with Democratic rival Jesse
Jackson _ which was to have been the last of the primary campaign _
and flew home little more than 12 hours after arriving on the West
Coast.
   Doctors had decided Thursday to go ahead with immediate surgery
after analyzing results of tests performed on Mrs. Dukakis.
   ``My impression is that when you have anything that involves the
spinal cord, the faster you move on it the better,'' Dukakis said
in an interview.
   Led by Zervas, chief of neurosurgery at the hospital, surgeons
planned to take a bone graft from Mrs. Dukakis's hip and use it to
replace a portion of the discs.
   ``The plan is to remove the discs compressing on the spinal
cord. The bone graft taken from the hip will be split and fused
into the vertabrae to replace the two areas from which the discs
will be removed,'' hospital spokesman Martin Bander said.
   Mrs. Dukakis underwent sophisticated tests, including magnetic
resonance imaging, while in Los Angeles last Saturday, and had more
tests upon returning to Massachusetts on Wednesday.
   Zervas said surgery was scheduled quickly ``because of the
worsening of the condition.''
   Dukakis left San Francisco after attending only one public
event, a talk with grade-school students about the environment on a
city beach.
   He said he regretted having to cancel campaign appearances but
``this is obviously the most important thing.'' He said he hoped to
resume campaigning over the weekend, if the surgery goes well.
   Both Dukakis and Jackson were campaigning toward the June 7
primaries in California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.

   A middle-aged woman spit and cursed at
a drawing of officers who served Germany's Third Reich. A European
man threw a beer mug to the floor, apparently enraged by the
decorations of Bangkok's ``Nazi Bar.''
   Trendy Thais are frequenting the new nightspot, but foreigners
have objected to the caricatures of Adolf Hitler, cartoons of
Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini, photos of storm troopers
and waiters with ``swastika'' armbands.
   ``For us, the bar is purely business-oriented, apolitical,
artistic and entertaining,'' said manager Aor Saratuk.
   He said he and business partners focused on the Nazi theme
because its ``powerful, catchy name and emotive appeal'' would draw
young patrons in a downtown area dotted with competitive pubs with
names such as ``Express'' or ``Studio West.''
   They flock to the bar to hear live music, seemingly oblivious to
objections that it glamorizes the brutal Nazi regime.
   Aor said there have been no complaints by Thais, but in recent
weeks several foreigners have criticized the bar in letters to the
English-language Bangkok Post newspaper.
   ``Simply stated, opening a bar that glamorizes any aspect of
Adolf Hitler or the Nazi regime is an offense against our common
humanity. If we can easily forget or trivialize the Holocaust, then
we are saying that human life is not sacred,'' one letter said.
   Thongbai Thongpao, Thailand's leading human rights lawyer, said
the management may not knowingly endorse Nazi Germany, but the
bar's name has had the ``unfortunate effect of hurting other
people's feelings because of memories evoked by the Holocaust
atrocity.''
   About 6 million European Jews were systematically exterminated
by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust.
   But not everyone finds the bar offensive.
   Jean-Paul Lorbach, a tourist from Brussels, Belgium, said,
``It's very pleasing here, just like any other bar. It's definitely
not Nazism.''
   A former Thai policeman, 25-year-old Boonserm Jitarasomkuan,
called Hitler a ``notorious criminal'' but advised the management
to keep the name because he said it was ``harmless.''
   Aor called some of the bar's decor ``deliberate distortions'' of
Nazism. A 10-foot portrait of Hitler reviewing troops in a trench
coat shows his moustache turned upwards and elongated _ not the way
he wore it. One color drawing depicted him in a straightjacket, and
was captioned: ``Captured German Painting.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis spent the morning in the hospital as
his wife, Kitty, underwent delicate spinal surgery. Vice President
George Bush arrived back in Washington from his summer home and
immediately went to visit cancer-stricken Salvadoran President Jose
Napoleon Duarte at an area hospital.
   The surgery on Mrs. Dukakis was begun early today and completed
in the afternoon. ``Preliminary indications look good,'' said
Martin Bander, a spokesman for Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston.
   Bush was to welcome President Reagan back from his Moscow summit
trip late today.
   Before taking a helicopter to Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
Bush said of Duarte, ``I plan to wish him well and share our
country's appreciation for all he's done for democracy.''
   Bush, returning to Washington today after a week of strategy
talks at his summer home, said he was convinced his campaign is
``on the right track'' despite a rash of recent surveys suggesting
he trails Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner.
   ``I'm not going to be stampeded by polls that don't mean
anything,'' the vice president told reporters on Thursday, as he
was preparing to leave his oceanside retreat at Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   Meanwhile, a poll in California gave Dukakis a substantial lead
over Jackson, his only remaining rival, in Tuesday's primary. But
it suggested Jackson, who has campaigned heavily in the state, was
gaining ground.
   Dukakis cut short a California campaign swing on Thursday after
his wife's doctors decided to perform ``urgent'' surgery on
herniated discs pressing dangerously on Mrs. Dukakis' spinal cord.
   Dukakis, who was spending the night at the hospital, visited his
wife late Thursday night and told reporters afterward: ``She's in
good spirits, looks good and is anxious to get this over with.''
   The governor said he hoped to resume campaigning this weekend if
the surgery went well.
   Jackson was campaigning today in New Mexico and Montana, whose
primaries on Tuesday have been largely overshadowed by big same-day
contests in New Jersey and California. The four races, with a total
of 466 delegates at stake, close out the Democratic primary season,
and offer Dukakis a chance to clinch the nomiantion.
   Of the 2,081 delegates needed to nominate, the Massachusetts
governor has nearly 1,800. Jackson trails with fewer than 1,000.
   In California, a poll conducted for the San Francisco Examiner
and San Francisco television station KRON indicated Dukakis led
Jackson by 24 percentage points, 52 percent to 28 percent. In a
similar survey two weeks ago, he led by 37 points.
   The poll, for which 600 registered Democratic voters were
questioned on Tuesday and Wednesday, has a margin of error of 4
percentage points, the Examiner said in Thursday's editions.
   Jackson was expressing hopes that a debate with Dukakis could be
arranged before Tuesday's primary. The two Democrats had been
scheduled to debate Thursday afternoon in California, but Dukakis
canceled out after his wife's doctors said they wanted to operate
without delay.
   ``My impression is that when you have anything that involves the
spinal cord, the faster you move on it the better,'' Dukakis said
as he was flying home Thursday night.
   Bush, meanwhile, was returning to Washington today in time to
greet President Reagan, who will be back from tonight from the
superpower summit.
   Some Bush supporters, eyeing a series of public-opinion surveys
last month that gave Dukakis double-digit leads, have been urging
Bush to try to set himself apart from Reagan on a few issues.
   Bush has edged away from the president on a matters such as
Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, under indictment on drug
charges, and Attorney General Edwin Meese III, under investigation
by an independent counsel. But he has refrained from any dramatic
breaks with the president.
   ``We've got a game plan. We've staying with it,'' he said.
``You're not going to see any drastic change in campaign plans.''
   On Thursday, he was asked about Reagan's suggestion that Soviet
reluctance to issue exit visas stems from bureaucratic problems
rather than Kremlin policy.
   Bush sidestepped the question. But he went on to criticize
Soviet human rights policy in stronger terms than the president has
used.
   ``I think we have very different views on human rights than the
Soviet Union,'' he said. ``I would suggest that Soviet retaliation
against us, saying we've got human rights problems, is mixing
apples and oranges.''
   The vice president added: ``We've got some problems, but they're
not problems of human rights.''
   Still, he hailed Reagan for raising human rights issues, saying:
``I think the Soviet Union should adhere to these high standards
the president is talking about.''
   Dukakis, too, made a point of praising Reagan for bringing up
human rights during the summit trip.
   ``We take pride in the message of freedom and human rights that
President Reagan brought with him to Moscow,'' the Democratic
candidate said in a statement issued by his campaign.

   The State Department said Friday the
Nicaraguan government's suspension of two radio news programs is a
violation of its commitment to guarantee freedom of expression.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the suspensions, announced
Wednesday, will prevent the programs from being broadcast through
the next round of cease-fire talks with Nicaraguan rebel leaders,
set for next week.
   ``This is probably not coincidental,'' Mrs. Oakley said, adding
that the suspensions violated commitments to free expression the
leftist government made in one agreement signed last August and
another two months ago.
   ``Restrictions like this can only damage the process of
establishing peace and democracy in Nicaragua,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   The programs affected by the temporary suspensions are broadcast
by Radio Catolica and Radio Corporacion.

<HEAD>Former Congressman And Mecham Aide Is Sentenced</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former congressman Sam Steiger, convicted
of pressuring a parole board member while working for then-Gov.
Evan Mecham, was sentenced today to four years' probation.
   Judge Ronald Reinstein of Maricopa County Superior Court also
fined Steiger $5,480 and sentenced him to perform 700 hours of
community service work. He suggested that Steiger, well known for
criticizing lawyers, consider doing volunteer work for the Arizona
Bar Association.
   Reinstein's sentencing options ranged from probation to five
years in prison.
   Assistant Attorney General Michael Cudahy had urged that the
judge consider giving Steiger jail time to impress upon him the
seriousness of the crime and to deter others. But a probation
officer recommended no jail and the judge agreed, saying he did not
think it would do Steiger any good.
   And Cudahy said after the sentencing he had no problem with
Steiger being put on probation.
   Steiger repeated his contention that he was singled out for
prosecution because he had been critical of Attorney General Bob
Corbin. He said he was not remorseful even though, ``prejudice and
precedence would dictate that I should be remorseful.''
   Reinstein said he was impressed by the outpouring of more than
170 letters on Steiger's behalf and did not believe that Steiger
was motivated by political or personal gain.
   But he said Steiger ``clearly broke the law,'' abused his power
and was trying to ``deflect your obvious wrong in this case'' on
others. He told Steiger one of the main reasons for the conviction
was that, ``Frankly, Mr. Steiger, you came off as a bully.''
   Steiger, 59, was convicted April 7 of theft by extortion for
threatening Board of Pardons and Paroles member Ron Johnson over a
personnel vote.
   Steiger claimed it was simply hardball politics, but Cudahy said
Steiger threatened Johnson's part-time job as a justice of the
peace ``in order to steal his vote'' on retention of the board's
executive director.
   Steiger, as congressman, rancher and newspaper columnist, has
taken on his colleagues, neighbors, business associates, former
wife, police and highway officials in a colorfull career.
   He was 28 and a Republican when he ran for the state senate from
a 10-1 Democratic district and won the first of two terms.
   Steiger spent 10 years in Congress as a Republican before he
made a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat. He ran for the
governorship on the Libertarian ticket in 1982.
   About a year ago, in the Prescott Sun, he repeated some of his
favorite advice.
   ``Shun lawyers, ignore lawyers, but above all, do not elect them
to public office,'' he said. ``Lawyers are the running sores of the
20th century, and if they are not isolated and done away with as
humanely as instinct will permit, they will be the cause of the
downfall of this culture.''

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 15th pvs, ``Bleakley, Lorillard xxx,

<TEXT>
   Lawyers defending three tobacco companies
against liability charges ended their cases by claiming that
smoking doesn't cause cancer and cigarette makers researched the
issue enough to fulfill their corporate responsibility.
   The judge in the case today granted a delay in closing arguments
to an attorney for the man suing the companies over his wife's
lung-cancer death.
   The company lawyers' closing arguments mainly centered on the
will and motives of Rose Cipollone, a 58-year-old woman who died of
lung cancer in 1984. Her husband, Antonio, is seeking damages from
the companies that made the cigarettes she smoked for 40 years.
   ``Mrs. Cipollone made a decision you and I make every day of our
lives: to do, or not to do, something that is risky,'' Philip
Morris Co. attorney Peter K. Bleakley told the U.S. District Court
jury Thursday.
   Bleakley also defended industry research efforts as legitimate
and worthy.
   Attorney Marc Z. Edell, representing Cipollone, said he needed
more time to prepare his closing arguments, which had been
scheduled for today.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin also said he will grant the
``extraordinary remedy'' of a half-hour of rebuttal to each company
after Edell makes his arguments Monday. He said the companies felt
Edell's delay would prejudice the jury against them.
   The judge said he expected the case to go to the jury Tuesday.
   Cipollone claims the industry's research was inadequate and
partly an attempt to deflect health critics, and that advertising
and public relations were used to muddle the issue, all as part of
an effort to mislead the public.
   On Thursday, the second day of summations in the four-month
trial, Bleakley continued the theme of the lawyers for Lorillard
Inc. and Liggett Group Inc. who preceded him: that Mrs. Cipollone
was an intelligent, strong-willed woman who knew the risks and
chose to smoke out of pleasure.
   ``People have been claiming that smoking is bad for you, that
it's bad for your health, that it kills you, as long as these
products have been on the market,'' he told the jury. ``People do
things all the time they know to be risky.''
   Cigarette ads have nothing to do with undermining that
knowledge, Bleakley argued.
   Enjoyment of tobacco ``predates advertising by several hundred
years,'' he said, attacking Cipollone's contention that ads kept
his wife hooked on cigarettes.
   The companies presented evidence to support their contention
that Mrs. Cipollone was intelligent, knew of smoking's risks
through newspaper articles and the warnings of relatives and made a
strong-willed choice to smoke.
   Bleakley, Lorillard attorney Robert Northrip and Liggett
attorney Donald J. Cohn referred to testimony by relatives that
Mrs. Cipollone's husband constantly told her to stop smoking, that
her mother blamed cigarettes for her father's death when Mrs.
Cipollone was a child, and that two sisters called cigarettes
``coffin nails'' as youths.
   Bleakley defended the Council for Tobacco Research, formed and
funded by the tobacco companies to study the health effects of
smoking.
   He said no evidence showed the scientists on the council's
advisory panel were anything but reputable and disinterested, and
that the companies had fulfilled their research responsibility
through the council.
   The cigarette companies still maintain that there is no proof
that cigarettes directly cause cancer.
   Northrip also focused on medical testimony by physicians who
treated Mrs. Cipollone, pathologists who studied her cancer and
cancer experts.
   He said physicians disagreed over what kind of lung cancer
killed Mrs. Cipollone.
   ``Some (kinds) are statistically associated with cigarette
smoking _ small cell carcinoma. Some are not _ carcinoid, or
atypical carcinoid,'' said Northrip.
   Cipollone's experts said Mrs. Cipollone had small cell
carcinoma, and argued that atypical carcinoid also results from
smoking.

   The International Whaling

whales in the North Atlantic for scientific purposes.
   Delegates at the end of the whaling commmission's annual meeting
said Japanese plans for coastal whalers to kill 210 whales by the
end of September would be considered by the commission in two
months.
   The recommendation that Norway spare the whales was approved by
a 14-4 vote. There were 10 abstentions.
   Norway had planned to kill 35 whales this year and an
unspecified number each year until 1992.

Seiferheld, correspondent for The Associated Press in Asuncion
since 1982, died Friday of cancer, his family said. He was 37.
   Seiferheld also worked for Time magazine and was a journalist
with the Asuncion newspaper ABC Color before it was closed in 1984
by the government of President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner for
allegedly publishing ``subversive'' articles.
   A graduate in history from the University of Sorbonne in Paris,
Seiferheld wrote several books, including ``The Asylum Of Peron,''
``The Fall Of Federico Chavez,'' ``Jews In Paraguay'' and
``Political-Military Conversations.''
   Seiferheld was a member of the Paraguayan Academy Of History and
secretary-general of the Paraguayan Institute of Geo-Political
Studies.
   He is survived by his wife and three children.

   Groups supported by Libya are the ``prime
suspects'' in a spate of recent attacks against Americans and U.S.
facilities around the world, a State Department spokeswoman said
Friday.
   ``There has been an upsurge in recent weeks of terrorist attacks
against U.S. and other western European interests in Europe, Latin
America and Africa,'' spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said. ``Although
these incidents are still under investigation in numerous cases,
the prime suspects are groups which have received support from
Libya.''
   The suspicion, she said, is accompanied by ``concrete evidence,
including the seizure of Libyan arms destined for the IRA (Irish
Republican Army) and the arrest in Senegal of Libyan operatives,
that Libya continues its support of terrorism.''
   Mrs. Oakley referred to reports that a weapons shipment
intercepted by France last November was bound for the outlawed IRA
and that suspected Libyan agents were arrested carrying bomb-making
materials in Senegal in February.
   For years, Libya has been one of less than a half-dozen
countries on a list of nations identified by the State Department
as sponsors of terrorist groups. The Reagan administration has
accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of fomenting terrorism and in
April 1986 U.S. warplanes attacked his personal living quarters in
Tripoli. He was not hit.
   Around the second anniversary of the attack, there were several
terrorist attacks on installations and clubs owned or frequented by
Americans.
   Among the targets hit this year were U.S. Information Agency
offices in Costa Rica, Colombia and Peru and the bombing of a club
frequented by American servicemen in Naples, Italy. Five people
were killed in the Naples attack. Two Americans were wounded in an
attack on a club in Khartoum, Sudan, in mid-May and the office of a
U.S. bank in New Delhi was also a target.
   Mrs. Oakley stopped short of directly accusing Libya in the
attacks, and U.S. officials have been quoted as saying there is no
``smoking gun'' to prove Gadhafi's involvement.
   ``We want to make sure that when we make statements about this,
that they correspond absolutely with the facts and the evidence
that we have,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said it is widely believed that Libya is the headquarters for an
organization led by Abu Nidal, a Palestinian accused of terrorism
who was expelled last year from Syria.
   The department has blamed Abu Nidal for the December 1985
attacks that killed more than 20 people at the Rome and Vienna
airports.

   American singer Laura Branigan
cried when she saw hungry black children eating their one daily
meal, but she voices no regrets about breaking the cultural boycott
of South Africa.
   Branigan concludes a series of six concerts this weekend at Sun
City, a sports-and-casino resort in the nominally independent black
homeland of Bophuthatswana.
   She is one of the few American pop stars to perform in South
Africa in recent years. In the early 1980s, Frank Sinatra, Dolly
Parton and Cher sang in the racially segregated country.
   ``People in the U.S. are so ignorant, to look down on
entertainers who come out here,'' said Branigan, who is white.
``You can come out here and help. They are hurting people by not
coming out, when they can come here and do good.''
   Earlier this week, Branigan was taken to schools and child-care
centers in a poverty-stricken part of Bophuthatswana where a
private charity, Operation Hunger, is active. Branigan had donated
$50,000 of her undisclosed performing fee to Operation Hunger.
   ``This is terrible,'' she said. ``How can they let this happen?
There's no excuse for it in such a rich country.''

   Country singer Loretta Lynn's
brother-in-law James Lynn has been approved for parole after
spending 20 years in prison for the fatal shooting of his wife.
   The Indiana Parole Board voted 3-1 Thursday to release Lynn, 50,
after he testified at a hearing at the State Prison, where he has
participated in substance-abuse counseling.
   ``He indicated Thursday that he has a weakness for alcohol and
has to be aware of it,'' said board Chairman Lewis J. Gregory, who
voted against Lynn's release.
   Lynn was granted clemency in 1986 and was put on a work-release
program, but was returned to prison after two alcohol-related
incidents, said Gregory.
   He said Lynn's parole plans must be approved in advance by the
state of Wisconsin, where he will live. That is expected to take a
couple of months, during which Lynn will remain in prison.
   Once released, Lynn, the brother of the singer's husband, Moody,
is expected to work in a restaurant owned by Ms. Lynn's daughter.
   Lynn was convicted for the March 31, 1968, death of his wife,
Sandra. Witnesses said he got out of a car and shot his wife in the
head and chest with a .38-caliber revolver as she sat in another
car.

   A congressman's praise of ``Soul Man'' James
Brown as ``our No. 1 ambassador'' was not intended literally, a
lawyer for the singer's wife, Adrienne, has concluded, so he's
dropping his motion seeking diplomatic immunity for her.
   Attorney Allen W. Johnson had asked a Richmond County State
Court judge to dismiss misdemeanor traffic charges on grounds of
diplomatic immunity, but he said Thursday he would withdraw the
motion.
   Mrs. Brown, 38, was charged with driving under the influence of
drugs, speeding and criminal trespass last September. She pleaded
innocent, and the case is expected to go to trial later this month.
   Rep. Douglas Barnard, D-Ga., said two years ago on James Brown
Appreciation Day in Augusta, near Brown's home on Beech Island,
S.C.: ``James is indeed our No. 1 ambassador.''
   Johnson said he asked for diplomatic immunity for the singer's
wife only because every possible defense had to be explored. He
said he has since determined that Barnard intended his comments as
a figure of speech.
   Diplomatic immunity shields officials of foreign nations from
criminal charges while they represent their countries in the United
States.
   The Browns have recently had several highly publicized fights,
and Brown has said he plans to file for divorce.

   The Oregon Symphony, led by a high school
classmate of Bill Cosby, has recorded a new arrangement of the
theme music to NBC-TV's top-rated ``The Cosby Show.''
   The jazz-influenced theme, which lasts just one minute, was
arranged and conducted by James DePreist, the symphony's music
director.
   The recording session Thursday was closed to visitors because
the show's producers don't want the music revealed until the new
television season begins in October.
   Each year Cosby requests a new arrangement to introduce and end
the show. This year he asked DePreist, who attended high school
with Cosby in Philadelphia, to do it.

   Designer Bob Mackie says he's too preoccupied
with his new ready-to-wear collections to entertain his celebrity
clients.
   ``Usually they like to come down, spend the day and have lunch.
I give them advice if they need it, but I don't like to be a

notables as Cher, Carol Burnett and Bernadette Peters.
   ``I don't want to know who is sleeping with whom or who is
getting a divorce. I don't want to be their date when their
husbands are out of town _ I'll leave that to the hairdressers.''
   Mackie, 49, said his new collections are a departure from his
beaded and feathered costuming.
   ``Now I have to think of the needs of women who buy
high-price-range clothes. What do they do?'' he asked. ``They go to

   Thieves who entered a luxury car dealership
shot to death two guard dogs and peppered several cars with bullets
before making off with a $20,000 BMW, police said.
   Dirk Essert, manager of Louis Motorcars, said he found the dogs
dead and the car missing when he came to work Thursday. Several
other BMWs and some Subarus were shot up, and tires were stolen
from a Cadillac, he told police.
   Essert estimated damage to the cars at $11,000, but said the
killing of the Doberman pinscher and German shepherd was more
upsetting.
   ``I felt sick. Plain and simple,'' said Essert, 39. ``The holes
in the cars can be fixed up. The dogs can't be replaced.''
   The dogs were owned by K-9 Orlando, a private company that
provides guard dogs at night and on weekends.
   Orange County sheriff's deputies said they have no suspects.

   As every comic book reader knows,
Metropolis is the home base of Superman, while Gotham is where
Batman wages his war against crime. Now, it seems, Maine's largest
city can lay claim to a superhero, too.
   Portland's ``Mr. Jigsaw,'' known to friends and family as
Charlie Grant, is a crime-fighter with detachable body parts that
continue to function after they leave his body.
   The character is the creation of comic book writer Ronald
Fortier of Somersworth, N.H.
   ``I love Maine and my wife and I come to Portland all the
time,'' Fortier said. ``So I decided to put the hero in Maine
because people are so warm and friendly there.''
   The 41-year-old Fortier writes the texts for the comic and sends
them to an illustrator in Hawaii, Gary Kato, who came up with the
suggestion for the kind-hearted hero.
   ``He told me he'd like to do a comedy superhero that can
dismember himself but still control the parts of his body,''
Fortier recalled. ``I thought he must be kidding.''
   In the initial episode of the hero's adventures, Mr. Jigsaw and
a reporter from the Portland Herald are waylaid by three escapees
from the Maine State Prison. Mr. Jigsaw dispatches the villains and
teams up with the reporter to fight crime and corruption.
   In an upcoming episode, Mr. Jigsaw catches a robber at a
shopping mall by throwing his hand at him.

   Herbert Bayer's controversial bright yellow,
85-foot-tall ``Articulated Wall'' sculpture in the Broadway Plaza
complex has developed a new problem: Its paint is peeling.
   The bright yellow color of the 850-ton concrete sculpture didn't
please everyone at its unveiling three years ago. Now, Broadway
Plaza's new owner, Western Equities Group, is negotiating with the
Denver Art Museum, which owns the ``Wall,'' to get permission to
paint the art work gold.
   Museum spokesman Lewis Story said changing the color might
violate Bayer's intent. The museum also is studying Western
Equities' plans to use drawings of the ``Wall'' as a logo on
marketing materials for Broadway Plaza.
   Bayer, an exponent of the Bauhaus school of modern design, died
in 1985. Bayer, and later his widow, Joella, tangled with former
Broadway Plaza owner Allan Reiver, claiming they were not
adequately paid. Mrs. Bayer recently settled the lawsuit.

   There was a buck on the line, a ``Buck''
on the bench and a city prosecutor bucking the system.
   City Prosecutor Ed Britton took Hutchinson's First National Bank
to court, alleging bank workers charged him more than agreed to
sort a handful of coins.
   Britton told District Court Judge William F. ``Buck'' Lyle the
bank clerk told him it would cost 50 cents.
   The coins amounted to $5.10, Britton said. The bank said that
because the amount was more than $5, the fee went up to a buck.
   They gave him $4.10, keeping the buck.
   Britton protested he hadn't been told of a sliding fee scale.
   During court proceedings, Lyle asked bank officials whether any
such fee schedule had been shown to Britton. They said, no. Lyle
then found for Britton, awarding him 50 cents.
   Britton also sought punitive damages but found the law does not
provide punitive damages in small claims cases.
   ``I wanted them penalized in the same percentage they penalized
me,'' he said.
   He got part of his wish.
   Judge ``Buck'' Lyle assessed court costs of $10 against the bank.

   Soldiers at a military base in the Ukraine showed
foreign reporters today how they will dismantle transports and
launchers for Soviet medium-range missiles, Tass said.
   The missiles are banned under a treaty which took effect
Wednesday when President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev exchanged ratification documents during the superpower
summit in Moscow. The leaders signed the agreement in Washington
last Dec. 8.
   The treaty mandates the destruction of all superpower
intermediate-range missiles, including the triple-warhead Soviet
RSD-10 rockets that are known in the West as SS-20s.
   Tass, the official news agency, said 43 broadcast journalists
from the United States, Britain, France, Japan and other countries
were invited today to the Sarny military base in the western
Ukraine to observe how SS-20 transports and launchers will be
eliminated.
   A detachment of Soviet soldiers under Col. Yevgeny Kozlov gave a
step-by-step demonstration, Tass said.
   The missiles themselves will be destroyed at another military
base, Kapustin Yar in the Volgograd region, Tass said. Their
nuclear charges will be extracted and used in the civilian economy,
it said.
   More than 600 launchers and wheeled transports used to carry the
missiles will be dismantled at Sarny over the next three years, in
accordance with the treaty, Tass said.
   American inspectors are expected to arrive at the base about 60
miles from the city of Rovno by July 1, where they will monitor the
elimination of the equipment, Tass said.
   Two two-story buildings with 10 one-room apartments apiece have
been built for the American inspectors, as well as a mess hall for
32 people and a bar, Tass said.
   Cottages have also been built in a nearby forest near a lake for
the Americans to use for off-hours relaxation, it said.

   Unemployment increased for the first time this
year to 5.6 percent in May, the Labor Department said Friday. But
both government officials and private economists cautioned that the
job figures for last month are too unreliable to suggest that the
economy is losing steam.
   The 0.2 percentage point increase from April's 14-year-low
civilian jobless rate of 5.4 percent reflected a seasonally
adjusted shrinking of the U.S. labor force by 363,000 people, with
536,000 fewer Americans at work.
   But before the seasonal adjustments made in the government's
household survey to reflect an historically burgeoning job market
in May with the end of school terms, the actual number of people
working increased by 317,000.
   A separate government survey of employer payrolls also showed
209,000 new jobs in May, down from an average net gain of 250,000
new jobs monthly over the past year but reflecting a still-tight
labor market.
   Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, said it would be premature to draw any conclusions from
the May change in the jobless rate based on her agency's household
survey.
   The unadjusted increase in May employment was ``very low'' by
historical standards, particularly when compared with a 1.3 million
rise the same month a year ago, Ms. Norwood told the congressional
Joint Economic Committee.
   ``In past years when May employment growth has been relatively
weak, substantial expansions generally occurred in June or July,''
she said. ``At this time of the year, it's more appropriate to
focus on the business survey, which shows continued, although
somewhat slower, growth than previously.''
   Private economists agreed, and some even suggested that the
unemployment rate may still be on a downward trend despite the
slight increase in May.
   ``You really can't identify a 0.2 percentage point move as a
change in the trend,'' said Chris Caton, an analyst for Data
Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ``Next month it will probably go
down a tenth of a percent.''
   Donald Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch, said the
April and May figures together indicate an economy that is still
growing strongly.
   ``There is nothing in this report that will convince people that
the economy is slowing appreciably or that inflation and interest
rates are not on the rise,'' he said.
   He predicted the unemployment rate will dip below April's 5.4
percent by year's end.
   The government's survey of employer payrolls shows manufacturing
jobs growing by 16,000 in May after an increase of 45,000 in April.
Construction employment fell by 16,000 following a rise of 157,000
from January through April.
   The 0.2 percentage point drop in April's jobless rate to the
lowest it had been since June 1974 had been propelled largely by
assembly line hiring by factories trying to keep with a surging
foreign demand for U.S. products.
   Ms. Norwood called May's 16,000 new factory jobs ``no real
change.'' But she said both the machinery and metal products
industries continued to register higher employment.
   ``The two export-influenced industries have paced the gains in
manufacturing over the last year, along with electrical equipment,
printing and publishing, chemicals and rubber and plastic
products,'' she said.
   Accompanying the resurgence in export-led manufacturing is a
strong growth in wholesale trade. Over the past year, wholesale
trade employment, most of it in durable goods distribution, has
increased by 275,000, including a 25,000 gain last month.
   ``Trying to read through the murkiness, the figures are telling
us pretty much what we already know about the economy,'' said
Charles Renfro, chief economist for Alphametrics, a consulting frim
in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``It's cooling off a little bit on the domestic
front but is still very strong on exports.''
   The biggest area of job growth last month was health services
with 35,000 new jobs, a reflection of the fact that the American
population is gradually aging. In the last year, the health care
industry has expanded by 380,000 workers, a trend that is expected
to continue.
   However, other areas of the service economy are slowing. New
employment in business services such as data processing, for
example, has fallen to an average monthly pace of 15,000 this year,
compared with 35,000 to 40,000 new jobs every month in 1987.
   Finance _ which includes banks, brokerage houses and mortage
companies _ had been one of the strongest areas of job growth
through much of the past six years of economic expansion but has
lost a total of 10,000 jobs since January.

<TEXT>
   The special-label Treaty Beer designed to
raise money to fight Indian treaty rights has been dropped by a
second brewery.
   Opponents have called it ``hate and prejudice in a can.''
   ``In as much as it's not our label, not our message, we did not
want to be put in the middle between two factions,'' Kenneth
Lichtendahl, president of Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. in
Cincinnati, said in a telephone interview Friday.
   The brewery was the second within a year to quit making the beer
for Stop Treaty Abuse Inc., a group opposed to Indian treaty rights
founded by Dean Crist, a Minocqua pizza parlor owner. Hibernia
Brewing Ltd. of Eau Claire, which made the beer when it was
introduced last summer, cited similar controversy when it stopped
after about a month.
   Treaty rights have become controversial in several states where
sportsfishermen and other outdoorsmen oppose tribes' exercises of
hunting, fishing, gathering and water rights retained under federal
treaties. Opponents have argued it is unfair to allow the Indians
to use methods or seasons prohibited others and that the exercise
of treaty rights may harm or deplete natural resources.
   Crist said Friday that Treaty Beer's future was uncertain and
blamed poor sales in Wisconsin and pressure on distributors in
Washington state not to carry the brew.
   Crist said he had no hard feeling toward Hudepohl-Schoenling,
which had filled about 2,000 cases of STA's cans with beer that was
sent for sale to Wisconsin.
   The brewery and STA had a contract that would have expired
around the first of the year but reached an agreement to terminate
it early because of the controversy and low sales volume, Crist
said.
   The beer, which featured a speared fish and the slogan ``True
brew of the working man'' on the label, had been the focus of
outcries in Wisconsin, Washington and Idaho.
   Sharon Metz, executive director of the Milwaukee-based Lutheran
Human Relations Association of America, applauded the brewery's
decision and said Friday she believed many of the people who wrote
the brewery to oppose the beer were responding to her group's
nationwide boycott call of the beer and the brewery.
   In Washington, where the beer had been scheduled to go on sale
last month but never did, Gov. Booth Gardner criticized the beer
and opponents of the brew had called it ``hate and prejudice in a
can.''
   In Idaho, the president of the Northwest Coalition Against
Malicious Harassment had denounced the beer and its planned sales
in other western states.
   ``I negotiated a multimillion-dollar contract (with the brewery)
and whereas they tolerated an enomorous amount of unjust criticism
... the volume just never materialized,'' Crist said.
   He said he was disheartened by northern Wisconsin store, resort
and tavern owners who complain loudly about the Chippewa Indians'
rights to spear fish but did not actively support the product and
promote sales.

<TEXT>
   An aging, foul-smelling Syrian freighter
anchored in this northern Italian port is at the center of a storm
over the dumping of chemical wastes.
   Caught in the middle are 18 crewmen who have been stuck aboard
the ship for four months with 2,100 tons of unidentified toxic
wastes.
   Six crew members from the cargo carrier Zanoobia, known in Italy
as the ``ship of poison,'' have been hospitalized. Other crewmen
say they only dream of getting paid and leaving the Zanoobia.
   ``We have been aboard for about four months, breathing the fumes
and the bad smell from the leaking drums,'' the Zanoobia's captain,
Ahmed Tabalo, said Wednesday.
   ``We all are weakened, depressed. We are only thinking of
returning home, even at the cost of leaving the ship and all our
belongings here,'' Tabalo said.
   Francesco Rizzuto, a lawyer for Tabalo Shipping, the owner of
the freighter, called the Zanoobia ``the tip of an iceberg of
illegal shipping of industrial wastes all around the world.''
   The waste on board the Zanoobia has been rejected by Djibouti,
Venezuela, Greece and Syria.
   Controversy over the ship and the cargo that nobody wants has
raised questions about whether industrialized nations are using
Third World countries to dispose of their wastes.
   Some Italian lawmakers have alleged in the European Parliament
that a group of U.S. companies offered $120 million annually to
dump about 3 million tons of industrial waste a year for five years
in Guinea Bissau, in West Africa.
   A joint statement issued Thursday by Libya and Nigeria denounced
agreements to bury nuclear and industrial wastes in Africa as a
``criminal and immoral'' act and urged African governments to bar
it.
   During a visit to the ship by a reporter, liquid leaked from
some of the 12,000 drums of waste, and crew members put sawdust on
the deck of the hold to keep it dry. The drums were secured in the
hold with frayed ropes, which posed risks in rough seas, Tabalo
said.
   The cargo's odyssey began in February 1987 when the waste from
Italian manufacturers left the Italian port of Marina di Carrara on
a Maltese freighter for Djibouti in East Africa. Djibouti officials
refused to accept the waste.
   It then went to Venezuela, where it was unloaded. But residents
raised a protest and a boy reportedly died after playing near a
leaking drum, so the waste was put aboard a Cypriot freighter.
There was no independent confirmation of the boy's death.
   The freighter took the cargo to Syria, where port authorities
ordered it out, claiming it might be contaminated by radioactivity.
It was transferred to the Zanoobia.
   The Zanoobia and its crew of 16 Syrians and two Lebanese brought
the waste back to Italy. The freighter was allowed to dock in Genoa
on Sunday after being anchored off Marina di Carrara for a month.
   The cargo will now be unloaded and disposed of in Italy, a job
that could take up to two months, according to port officials in
Geneva. No date has been set for the unloading to begin.
   Genoa health and port officials, who have been monitoring air
and water around the ship, lowered four guinea pigs into the hold
to test the toxic level. They said a test of 40 drums did not turn
up signs of radioactivity.
   Five Zanoobia crewmen were hospitalized in Carrara but were
later released. Rizzuto said Friday that a crewmen remains in a
Genoa hospital suffering from nausea and stomach pains. No results
have been released from their medical examinations, he said.
   The Italian government has appropriated $3.3 million to
incinerate the waste. The money will be repaid by Jelly Wax, the
Milan firm contracted to dispose of the chemicals.
   A Genoa judge, Marco Devoto, announced he has opened an
investigation into the activities of Jelly Wax. Rizzuto contends
that Jelly Wax has sent at least five other cargos of industrial
waste to unidentified destinations this year.
   The firm has refused comment on the case.

<HEAD>Commissioners To Reconsider Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Commission did not intend to
offend the tobacco industry when it voted to approve a smoking ban
in city-owned buildings, a member who wants the policy rescinded
said.
   ``Although the restrictions were small, we wouldn't want them to
mushroom,'' said Commissioner Jack Ross, who had originally voted
for the policy when it was approved last month.
   The policy, which took effect Wednesday, bans smoking in the
main lobby of city hall, city commission chambers, the city bus
station and a handful of other public places.
   It has drawn protest from the Pinkerton Tobacco Co., Daviess
County's largest industrial employer, which contends the ban
reflects a poor attitude toward tobacco in the city. The company
said it will reconsider its plans to expand the plant, which
employs more than 500.
   Mayor David Adkisson, who opposes a move to rescind the policy,
said it will not harm the tobacco industry and that he had heard no
one in town voicing opposition to it before it passed.
   ``People will continue to make money from tobacco,'' he said.
``When a police officer writes a speeding ticket, that doesn't mean
that local government is against the automobile industry.''
   Owensboro, with a population of 55,000, is a major tobacco sales
center for western Kentucky burley. The Daviess County Farm Bureau
estimates that area tobacco sales topped $25 million last year.
   Pinkerton manufactures loose leaf and plug chewing tobaccos, and
also makes some smoking tobacco products.
   Luther Pittman, executive vice president for operations at
Pinkerton, said in a letter to Adkisson that the company would
``rethink'' its plans for the future in Daviess County. But he said
his letter does not mean the company is planning to pull out of the
county.
   One wholesaler said it's not so much the policy that worries
him, but the trend.
   ``It's the kind of negative thinking that we shouldn't have in
Owensboro, Daviess County or the Commonwealth of Kentucky, where so
many dollars are derived from tobacco,'' said Truett Cook,
president of Lyons Bro. Wholesalers, a distributor of tobacco,
candy and groceries.

   Another Arab strike paralyzed the occupied
lands Friday, and a 20-year-old man shot in the chest became the
200th Palestinian killed since a rebellion against Israeli rule
began six months ago.
   Officials at Alia hospital in Hebron said relatives of Mustafa
Ahmed Halaika told them the man was shot by Jewish settlers in the
nearby West Bank village of Shuykh.
   He died of a bullet wound in the chest, and three other Arabs
were wounded by gunfire in the village, the hospital officials
said. Soldiers wounded two other Palestinians during a protest in
Nablus.
   The three-day strike that began Friday was total. Stores were
closed, streets were deserted and there was no public
transportation throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Halaika's relatives said five Jewish settlers opened fire when
Palestinians protested their presence in Shuykh, the hospital
officials said.
   A Palestinian driver who accompanied two journalists to the
hospital quoted a 15-year-old villager, Nael Ayaide, as saying the
settlers beat him and another Arab.
   Villagers began stoning the settlers, who then opened fire, the
driver quoted Ayaide as saying. The driver said Ayaide had a broken
arm.
   The driver and hospital officials would not allow their names to
be used. A military spokesman said the army was investigating the
reports.
   The driver said the two Arabs wounded in Nablus were shot when
soldiers opened fire on protesters who erected barricades and threw
stones.
   According to U.N. figures, 200 Arabs have been killed since the
uprising began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the
West Bank and Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 war. An Israeli soldier and a teen-age Jewish settler also
have been slain.
   The army prepared for more violence by restricting the movements
of more than 200,000 Palestinians with curfews and closures at 12
refugee camps, towns and villages.
   In the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers orders a metalworks closed
for three years. The army accused the owner, Nasser Youssef, of
making large nails that Arabs scatter on roads to puncture the
tires of Israeli-owned cars.
   In Bethlehem, protesters hung Palestinians flags on telephone
wires and painted slogans on walls that said, among other things,
``Observe the strike or we are going to burn.'' Israel has declared
the Palestinian flag illegal.
   Palestinian leaders ordered the three-day strike to protest the
current Middle East tour of George P. Shultz, the U.S. secretary of
state. It began Friday in Cairo and will include a stop in Israel
on Sunday.
   Israeli officials said the trip is important for keeping the
peace process alive, but they do not expect dramatic results. Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes an exchange
of occupied land for peace, the basis of the U.S. plan Shultz is
promoting.
   In a leaflet calling for the strike, underground leaders accused
Shultz of trying to abort the rebellion.
   ``The masses and activists must make more demonstrations and ..
. the land must burn under the feet of the fascist occupier,'' the
leaflet said.
   A general strike declared last Monday had little effect, and
this one has been seen as a test of the ``intefadeh,'' the Arabic
word for uprising.
   Shamir, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and other Israeli leaders
have said recently the rebellion was abating and Clinton Bailey, an
Arab affairs expert at Tel Aviv University, said Palestinians were
losing their enthusiasm.
   ``It's kind of hard to get people out in the streets right
now,'' he said. ``You don't have that mass identification you had
in the past.''
   Shamir said in a statement carried Friday on Israel radio
``there are signs the uprising is waning,'' but added that
``undesirable intervention by Jews and Israelis'' helped keep it
going. He did not elaborate.

   A judge today refused to grant a mistrial
in former Gov. Evan Mecham's criminal trial, rejecting a defense
argument that the prosecution introduced improper testimony during
the trial's first day.
   The motion contended that testimony Thursday by a prosecution
witness ``suggests that the defendants had committed prior bad acts
or criminal conduct involving altered campaign records.''
   It referred to testimony by William Flynn, a state handwriting
expert, that there had been ``white-outs, erasures and
alterations'' in a campaign checkbook, defense lawyer Thomas Crowe
said.
   Crowe contended the changes were merely innocent corrections,
but that the prosecution implied there was ``something sinister''
about them.
   Mecham and his brother, Willard, are charged with concealing a
$350,000 campaign loan. Willard Mecham was his brother's 1986
campaign treasurer.
   Prosecutor Barnett Lotstein said today there was no negative
implication in the testimony about the checkbook. He said the
prosecution was seeking to show that Willard Mecham was a
meticulous bookkeeper who was not prone to mistakes.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Ryan said in his
ruling that he thought Flynn's testimony was ``quite innocuous.''
   In opening statements Thursday, defense lawyers said the failure
to report the loan was an innocent mistake, while Lotstein alleged
the Mechams purposely broke the law when they failed to include the
loan from Tempe developer Barry Wolfson in a financial report.
   ``It was no oversight, no mistake,'' said Lotstein, an assistant
attorney general. ``No person looking at this report would have any
idea that Barry Wolfson had anything to do with the $350,000 that
came into the campaign.''
   About 90 minutes before the start of the trial Thursday, the
Arizona Supreme Court rejected a defense bid to dismiss the charges
or return them to the state grand jury for a new determination of
probable cause. The defense has claimed the grand jury was misled
by the state attorney general's office.
   Mecham faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all six
counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents.
   The Republican governor was removed from office April 4 when the
state Senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment counts.
Mecham took office in January 1987.
   Willard Mecham faces three similar counts and up to 9{ years in
prison if convicted.
   Mecham long has contended the $350,000 loan was properly
reported on his Dec. 5, 1986, financial report. He said it was
included in a $465,000 lump sum that was listed as a contribution
from himself.
   ``If you wanted to conceal a loan you could do it very easily,''
Scott said. ``The prosecution's case is made out of smoke.''
   Lotstein told the jury that Mecham had a 1986 campaign theme
``of being beholden to no one'' and that the theme could have been
harmed by public knowledge that a major part of his war chest came
from a developer.
   But Scott noted that Mecham was elected Nov. 4, 1986, a month
before the financial report was filed.
   Flynn testified that the ``Evan Mecham'' signed on one of the
governor's 1986 campaign financial reporting statements was not
Mecham's handwriting, ``but is rather an attempt to simulate or
draw the signature of Evan Mecham.''
   The signatures on Mecham's other documents were genuine, Flynn
testified. Scott objected, saying no one had disputed the
authenticity of the forms themselves.
   Scott also said a Mecham administration official, Mac Matheson,
was responsible for omitting the debt to Wolfson from Mecham's
personal disclosure form filed in early 1987. The defense lawyer
added that other officials were allowed to amend their forms
without being prosecuted.
   Willard Mecham's lawyer, Joe Keilp, said in his opening
statement that his client did not intentionally violate the law as
the 1986 campaign's bookkeeper.

   Jackie Collins, self-appointed doyenne of
Hollywood writers, says she, like the subjects of her novels,
searched for and found the American dream.
   ``You see it all the time on television,'' said the British
expatriate and younger sister of ``Dynasty'' vixen Joan Collins.
``Real people who come out to Hollywood with nothing and parlay
that into something. People like Hefner, Cartier, the Kennedys.
It's their story.''
   Ms. Collins recounted recently how she was expelled from her
exclusive English high school for smoking, after which her parents
told her: ```You're not bad looking. Why don't you go off to
Hollywood and be a movie star like your sister.'''
   Dismal bit parts steered Ms. Collins away from acting and toward
writing about the players. Her latest ode to life in the fast lane,
``Rock Star,'' held steady at No. 4 on last week's New York Times
best-seller list, following her last two local tell-alls
``Hollywood Wives'' and ``Hollywood Husbands.''
   ``Some people tend to regard me as the Hollywood expert,'' she
said. ``I could write a book tomorrow with all the real names _
short one-liners that would let you know exactly who everybody
really was.''

   Police said Friday they were searching
for a 9-year-old boy wanted in a string of burglaries allegedly
conducted with his 10-year-old partner.
   The boys, who lived in a hotel primarily used as a residence for
the homeless, allegedly conducted one burglary with an adult, who
is charged with sexually abusing them, police said.
   Paul Karnaugh, 30, of White Plains, was charged Wednesday with
three counts of first-degree sodomy and one count of third-degree
burglary, police said. He was jailed in lieu of $10,000 bail.
   Karnaugh was arrested after police charged the 10-year-old with
seven counts of third-degree burglary for ransacking and
vandalizing several offices, police Capt. James Harding said.
   The 10-year-old boy was in the custody of the county's Child
Protective Services at an undisclosed location. The 9-year-old boy
was being sought, Harding said. His mother and the boy frequently
spend days at a time away from the hotel, he said.

<HEAD>House Earmarks $1.6 Billion for Super Collider</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted overwhelming approval Friday
to a Department of Energy spending blueprint that includes $1.6
billion for the superconducting super collider, a massive
high-energy physics project.
   The super collider, which advocates say could lead to
breakthroughs in understanding basic matter, would be authorized
$147 million in fiscal 1989 and $675 million and $774 million the
following two years.
   There is no guarantee that the money would flow to the project,
which would eventually cost at least $5.4 billion. Actual spending
is controlled by separate appropriations legislation.
   The House recently approved an appropriations bill limiting
super collider spending in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1, to
$100 million. None would be available to begin construction of the
project.
   The Reagan administration requested $363 million for the project
in fiscal 1989, including money for construction. In its votes on
both bills, the House has said a decision to build should await the
next administration.
   The bill sent to the Senate on Friday by a 290-27 vote would
authorize continued spending on a wide variety of research and
development by the Department of Energy, including clean-coal
technology and alternative motor fuels.
   The legislation sets a spending target of $3.277 billion for
fiscal 1989, about $150 million above the current level and $26.4
million more than the administration sought.

   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said
Friday that Mikhail S. Gorbachev has not yet guaranteed human
rights but that the Soviet leader must be given time and trust to
carry out his reforms.
   Sahharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner and a former
political exile, told reporters at the Foreign Ministry press
center that his unprecedented appearance at a government building
``reflects a change in the situation in this country, and it's not
a matter of me changing my position.''
   He held his news conference in the same hall where Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday held his first formal meeting
with reporters in the Soviet Union.
   Sakharov, 67, handed Gorbachev a list of names of 200 political
prisoners when they met for the first time in January. On Friday,
he called again for the release of those who remain incarcerated
for their beliefs.
   The physicist, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb and
found the Soviet human rights movement, also criticized officials
for withdrawing a job offer to a dissident who met with President
Reagan during the summit.
   The move was ``a blatant example of a return to the practices of
the past,'' Sakharov said.
   Sakharov sat at a desk in front of hundreds of foreign and
Soviet reporters rather than on the elevated dais, and he drew a
larger crowd than Gorbachev.
   Until recently, such a news conference would have been
unthinkable for Sakharov, who was exiled to the closed city of
Gorky in January 1980 for criticizing Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan.
   Gorbachev allowed Sakharov to return to Moscow in December 1986.
   ``I believe sizeable changes have taken place of late. Of course
they are not exhaustive and do not ensure the full implementation
of human rights,'' Sakharov said. ``On the whole, I believe
perestroika (Gorbachev's social and economic reforms) is a serious
undertaking, and its international and domestic implications are
very serious, too.
   ``An expression of trust in this country ... would only promote
perestroika in this country. In particular, an expression of
confidence in this country and this government will help promote
human rights issues, too.''
   He said he is worried about the future of Gorbachev's reforms
but believes they will succeed because there is no alternative.
   Sakharov called Gorbachev an ``outstanding statesman'' and
added, ``from the bottom of my heart I wish him luck, mainly for
the cause with which his name is now associated.''
   Sakharov has been reluctant to talk to reporters since returning
from Gorky, instead concentrating on scientific work and expressing
his views in occasional letters to the official press.
   He said he still is not free to travel abroad, ostensibly
because of his access to secret material until 1968, but feels he
is free to do and and say what he wants in the Soviet Union.
   Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, said her husband held the news
conference at the government press center because reporters
covering the summit meeting had called ``from morning to night,''
asking for interviews.
   On other issues in a wide-ranging discussion, Sakharov:
   _Welcomed the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, which started
May 15. He said it should go on regardless of the conduct of
anti-Marxist Afghan rebels. Any Afghan who wants it should be given
political asylum in the Soviet Union or another country, he said.
   _Urged the Soviet Union to cut its military personnel by 50
percent, and criticized what he said is abuse of inductees in the
Soviet military.
   _Said he believes the Soviet Union eventually will have more
than one political party.
   _Supported the demands of two ethnic groups _ Crimean Tatars who
want to return to their home area from which they were exiled by
dictator Josef Stalin, and Armenians who want to annex the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.
   _Called for greater religious freedom and official recognition
of the underground Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   Sakharov, who has spoken out on nuclear arms reduction, said the
summit between Reagan and Gorbachev was important but did not
achieve much.
   He urged the two sides to work for more progress on a treaty to
halve their long-range nuclear missiles, saying they can work
around their disputes over verification problems and Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Sakharov praised Reagan's meeting on Monday with Soviet
dissidents and refuseniks but criticized the Soviet reaction. A
long-time dissident lost a job opportunity because of his
attendance, Sakharov said.
   He said Sergei Kovalov, a biologist, had reached an agreement to
receive a job in a Moscow institute, but was told the day after his
meeting with Reagan that the institute had changed its mind.
Kovalov was exiled in the 1970s for his work publishing underground
political material.

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes In Trash Bin; 4 Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb hidden in a trash bin
exploded on a busy street corner Friday, killing four people and
injuring 19 in South Africa's deadliest bombing in more than a year.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok blamed the African National
Congress guerrilla movement, which has been accused of four other
bombings in the past nine days.
   The ANC has not commented on the recent bombings. But it issued
a statement Friday from its headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, saying
the month of June ``must be a period of united and decisive popular
offensive'' against the government.
   The statement endorsed a three-day anti-apartheid protest
scheduled to start Monday, saying South Africa's economy ``must
grind to a halt'' on those days.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting the South African
government.
   Several corporations sought court orders Friday barring black
unions from organizing work stoppages next week. The employers
alleged that the protest could lead to violence.
   The bomb exploded at 1:30 p.m. outside a branch of the Standard
Bank in Roodepoort, a city that borders the west side of
Johannesburg. Three black men and a white woman were killed.
   A Roodepoort police spokesman, Maj. Tiene Halgryn, said eight
people were seriously injured, including two whites and six blacks.
He said 11 people suffered less severe injuries.
   Police said most of the victims were waiting at the street
corner for a traffic light to change when the explosion ripped
through a metal trash bin.
   The blast shattered windows in the bank and nearby stores in
Roodepoort's central business district.
   Police said the explosive device was a Soviet-made limpet mine,
and they searched for other bombs in the area.
   Most of the bombings blamed on the ANC in recent months have
involved limpet mines. Government posters encourage the public to
watch out for the mines, which can be attached to other objects.
   ``If everyone is on guard, the ANC's diabolical plans cannot
succeed,'' said Vlok, the law and order minister.
   The ANC has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 as
part of its efforts to topple the government and end apartheid, the
system of racial separation that denies South Africa's black
majority a vote in national affairs.
   In the past, the ANC's official policy has been to aim its
attacks at targets linked to the government and security forces.
Its leaders have warned that some civilian casualties were
inevitable.
   The death toll in Roodepoort was the highest from a bombing in
South Africa since a car bomb killed four white policemen in
Johannesburg in May 1987.
   It was the fifth bombing reported in the area in a nine-day
span. The only other injuries came from a May 26 bombing in
Pretoria that hurt four white women.
   The statement from ANC headquarters, issued shortly after
Friday's explosion, said the ANC had distributed leaflets in South
Africa endorsing the planned protests by anti-apartheid labor
unions and church groups.
   Government officials and employers have warned that workers who
participate face dismissal or legal action.
   The protest is intended to express opposition to the bannings of
major anti-apartheid organizations and other government moves
against opposing trade unions, newspapers and individual activists.
The two largest black federations say their main grievance is
proposed labor legislation that would curtail unions' ability to
strike.
   The Chamber of Mines, which represents South Africa's six major
mining companies, said the unions were using the proposed bill ``as
a rallying point to polarize the work force.''
   One gold mining company, Free State Consolidated, said it
obtained a court injunction Friday barring the black miners' union
from organizing a protest strike.
   The company said the protest call has ``been backed by threats
of violence and coercion.''

   Authorities seeking to ease tension after a gang
killed a university student arrested six suspects Friday and agreed
to most demands of fellow students who marched in protest.
   Hundreds of students at Beijing University gathered at the
center of campus into early Saturday to discuss the slaying and
their demands for retribution.
   Chai Qingfeng, 22, a geophysics graduate student, died Thursday
of injuries suffered the day before when he and several classmates
were beaten by a gang of youths off campus.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Friday that police had
arrested six suspects. It did not identify them. One of many
student posters on campus demanded that authorities ``make the
killers pay their blood debt.''
   Students at China's leading university said police should have
stopped the killing, and 2,000 marched in protest Thursday night.
About 700 of them walked the 10 miles to Tiananmen Square in
central Beijing, where they met before dawn Friday with officials
of the Public Security Ministry.
   They demanded swift arrests, a public trial on campus, full
media coverage of their protest, better campus security, a
university memorial service for Chai and compensation for his
family.
   Beijing University's General Affairs Advisory Office put a
notice on the campus bulletin board late Friday indicating
officials agreed to all demands except trial on campus. It said
media coverage could not be ordered, but the students scoffed at
that.
   The Beijing Daily newspaper carried a brief report Friday on
Chai's death, but the official media did not mention the student
march until a short Xinhua report early Saturday.
   According to the advisory office notice, Vice Minister of Public
Security Yu Lei acknowledged, ``We didn't do our job well and we
will definitely learn a lesson from this case.''
   His ministry also declared the student demands just and
reasonable, which implied no action would be taken even though the
march was illegal.
   It was the largest demonstration since student pro-democracy
protests in the winter of 1986-87 that led to the ouster of
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang and a nationwide campaign against
Western-style liberalism.
   Since then, permission has been required for street marches.
   The advisory office notice said Public Security officials would
visit the campus Saturday to study ways of tightening security.
   Theft is common at Chinese universities, but violent attacks on
students are unusual. Posters protesting lawlessness and poor
security appeared on the Beijing University bulletin board, and
several noted it was the second killing of a student in the past
year.
   A student at the University of Foreign Economic Relations was
slain in December in a fight with two local youths, one of whom was
executed. About 1,000 students marched to government offices in
central Beijing to protest that killing.
   An 18-year-old woman who took part in Thursday's march said
several police vehicles followed but did not try to stop the
protest.
   She said Public Security officials told the marchers ``they
understood us but that it is not a good idea to take to the
streets.''
   School spokesman Li Yansong said: ``The university is of course
on the side of the students. We can say the students' demands are
just, but the university first must investigate the matter.''
   He said a memorial service would be held for Chai but no date
had been set.

   Iraqi forces on Friday drove off an
Iranian warplane that flew 110 miles into Iraq and tried to bomb
President Saddam Hussein's family home north of Baghdad, a military
command announced.
   While maneuvering to evade Iraqi ground fire, the Iranian jet
``dropped all its load of explosives indiscriminately'' in the
village of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, Saddam's hometown, the
official Iraqi News Agency said.
   No injuries were reported in the attack at 5:55 a.m., according
to the news agency. The report, monitored in Nicosia, did not say
whether Saddam was home at the time. It was the first time the
Iraqis have reported an attack on Saddam's hometown during the
nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   The report did not say whether the U.S.-built Iranian F-4
Phantom jet was hit.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said its warplanes
on Friday attacked military targets in three raids on Iraq,
including one near Tikrit at 5:25 a.m., but it gave no other
details.
   Iran's new acting commander-in-chief, Hashemi Rafsanjani, urged
his countrymen to take the war with Iraq ``more seriously.''
   The Iraqi News Agency did not explain how the Iranian plane flew
undetected all the way from the border, 110 miles to the east, to
attack Saddam's home, which is 100 miles northwest of Baghdad.
Military analysts said an F-4 flying at low altitudes is capable of
evading detection by radar.
   After the attack, Saddam led a meeting of the governing
Revolutionary Command Council.
   An official spokesman, who was not identified by name, said the
leadership decided ``not to carry out a direct retaliation today
... to help the Iranian people liberate themselves from the
nightmare of these evil charlatan rulers.''
   But, he added, ``Iraq will reserve its right to carry out a
crushing and comprehensive retaliation at the appropriate time.''
He called the Iranian attack ``a flagrant violation'' of a truce in
the ``war of the cities.''
   Thousands of civilians in both countries were killed in
long-range missile duels and air raids that raged for two months
before the April 21 cease-fire in the war of the cities. Many of
the missiles hit Tehran and Baghdad.
   Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran's Parliament, was appointed by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Thursday as acting
commander-in-chief, a post Khomeini had held since the Islamic
Revolution in 1979.
   Rafsanjani told a prayer meeting in Tehran on Friday there
should be ``no compromise, no submission and no backing down from
our rights'' in the war. His speech was carried by IRNA, which also
was monitored in Nicosia. ``We should take the situation more
seriously,'' he told the worshipers.
   The Iranian agency also reported that Rafsanjani sent a cable to
the 87-year-old Khomeini thanking him for the new appointment.
   Iran suffered two recent major defeats on the battlefield. In
April, Iraqi forces retook the southern Faw peninsula, two years
after it was captured by the Iranians. Last month, the Iraqis
recaptured Salamchah, east of the city of Basra. The latter region
had been overrun in an Iranian thrust last year.
   Earlier Friday, Rafsanjani told a congress commemorating a 1963
attempted uprising against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi that the war
with Iraq should continue until all the objectives set by Khomeini
are reached.
   Rafsanjani said: ``If we back down even a bit in the war, we
will sustain major losses.'' He called on armed forces to recruit
more people into ``war-related affairs'' so that ``arrogance will
be deprived of its last weapon and we can prepare to face the next
schemes of the world-devourers.''

<HEAD>FAA Official Cautions Against `Knee-Jerk' Response to Aloha Jet
Breakup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and the aircraft industry need
to avoid any ``knee jerk'' reactions to the recent in-flight
breakup of a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines 737, a federal aviation
official said Friday.
   But Robert Goodrich, director of the Federal Aviation
Administration's office of flight standards, said the ``horrible
unzipping'' of the Aloha plane prompted the FAA to make a thorough
review of inspection and maintenance programs for aging jetliners.
   ``If we have a good program we need to validate it, and if we
have a problem we need to find it,'' Goodrich told reporters at the
conclusion of a three-day, FAA-sponsored conference on aging
airplanes.
   Goodrich said that while nothing particularly new surfaced
during the conference, he thought it would ``help restore public
confidence'' in the airline industry and represented a ``new
commitment to safety.''
   The conference, which involved about 350 aircraft design and
maintenance experts, issued a series of recommendations including:
   _Additional research and testing of older planes by either the
FAA or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that may
involve the federal government actually buying several aging
jetliners.
   _Increased communication between the airlines, manufacturers and
the FAA.
   _A review of all aspect of ``human factors'' involved in
inspection and maintenance.
   Goodrich said such things as boredom and fatigue by inpsectors
and maintenance personnel could be a problem.
   ``It could be a weak link,'' he said. ``The human element must
keep up with the technology growth. We need to make sure inspection
and maintenance is adequate. We think it is.''
   The FAA hopes to hire an additional 1,000 inspectors in the next
fiscal year, he said.
   Among other suggestions that surfaced at the conference was
imposing a mandatory retirement age for airplanes, but Goodrich
said the FAA believed that would be ``arbitrary'' and that the
increasing costs of maintaining an older plane usually dictate when
it is retired.
   ``That would be a knee-jerk reaction,'' Goodrich said of
mandatory retirement.
   Boeing officials also have said they are against mandatory
retirement for commercial jets.
   Goodrich said the Aloha accident has helped focus the attention
of manufacturers, airlines and the FAA on possible problems with
older airplanes.
   ``The history of the fleet says we are doing well,'' he said.
``I don't think it is a serious snowplowing problem that is getting
ahead of the industry. But one event is too many.''
   In the Aloha accident in April, a 20-foot section of the
Boeing-built plane tore away at 24,000 feet over Hawaii and a
flight attendant was swept to her death, although the pilots were
able to land the plane safely.
   Aloha officials have said repeatedly that they followed all
required inspections on the jetliner.

<HEAD>Cookie Case Ends With A Little Dough, A Lot Of Garbage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of the confiscated cookies has
ended with their maker giving up a little dough and county offices
no longer smelling like a cookie jar.
   The evidence became garbage Wednesday when 979 tubs of chocolate
chip cookies, weighing 2,448 pounds, were deposited at the Brea
dump.
   The cookies, made by Hobbitt Cookies of Santa Ana, were
confiscated from two stores in November as alleged evidence that
the bakery was operating without a health permit.
   For eight months, the cookies were stacked 10 feet high in a
meeting room at the Orange County environmental health office,
covering two walls.
   No one was happier to get rid of the cookies than Bob Merryman,
the county's environmental health director. ``The room really is
kind of sickening. One smell of cookies is OK, but you get this big
whiff when you open the door,'' he said. ``I had to leave meetings
after half an hour.''
   ``This was not your normal run-of-the-mill criminal case,'' said
Randall Hite, the attorney for Hobbitt. ``When people around the
courthouse realized what it was about, it became known as the
cookie caper.''
   The caper concluded after Hobbitt, charged with nine counts of
violating the California Uniform Retail Food Facilities Law, agreed
to a settlement last month under which all charges were dropped.
   The settlement called for Hobbitt to pay $750, drop a claim it
had filed against the city and relinquish ownership of the
confiscated cookies.
   ``This is the most unusual condemnation I'm aware of in 17 years
here,'' said Jim Huston, assistant director of county environmental
health.
   A county health inspector discovered alleged violations at
Hobbitt's Santa Ana plant a year ago and the company was ordered to
shut down. But in October, inspectors found evidence of clandestine
cookie baking, including raw ingredients and utensils, Huston said.
   The cookies were seized as evidence.
   Hobbitt filed a claim against the city, contending the
confiscated cookies were baked legally at a licensed plant in
adjoining Los Angeles County.
   The Santa Ana plant ``was used only for testing recipes and as a
training area for people learning to make the cookies by hand,''
Hite said.
   ``There were never any allegations that the cookies were in any
way contaminated or unsafe. It was all building code and permitting
violations,'' Hite said.
   ``The cookies are probably the finest ones made anywhere. Take
my word for it, I've sat in front of my television set and eaten
half a tubful,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   The leader of Iran's only legal opposition movement
has protested to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini about a series of
arrests that followed criticism of the ayatollah's policies,
according to reports reaching Paris on Friday.
   In a telegram to Iran's spiritual leader, Mehdi Bazargan took
responsiblity for letters written by himself and his supporters
calling for an end to the war with Iraq, the French newspaper Le
Monde reported.
   ``Our only crime is to be concerned about the dangers which
threaten the existence of our country and its survival,'' Le Monde
quoted the telegram as saying.
   There had been concern that Bazargan also had been arrested, but
he was at his Tehran home on Thursday, Le Monde reported.
   In late May, Bazargan circulated an open letter to Khomeini
accusing him of practicing ``despotism worthy of the pharaohs'' and
making Iran a symbol of hate around the world.
   Security forces subsequently rounded up numerous sympathizers of
Bazargan who had circulated their own letter, according to Le Monde
and Paris-based opposition figures with sources in Iran.
   Bazargan, a former Iranian prime minister and parliamentary
deputy, heads the Freedom Movement, the only opposition group
tolerated by Khomeini's regime.
   It was not clear how many arrests were made. Le Monde suggested
that several dozen people, many former government ministers, could
have been detained.
   The letters from Bazargan and his supporters, said to have been
distributed over the past two weeks, called for negotiations to end
the Iran-Iraq war.
   Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, living in exile
in Paris, said his contacts in Iran were able to confirm that
Bazargan was not under arrest.
   Observers say Bazargan's open letter was his strongest protest
to date and had special impact because of an increasingly tense
climate in Tehran after recent setbacks in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Bazargan ``has protested in the past, but not in these terms and
in this situation,'' Bani-Sadr said in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press. ``The arrests show that this letter is not
like others. It reveals the condition of public opinion in Iran.''
   On Thursday, Khomeini appointed Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani as acting commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces. On
Friday, Rafsanjani called on Iranians to take the war ``more
seriously.''
   Bani-Sadr, first president of the Islamic Republic and former
armed forces commander-in-chief, said he had ample information to
show an ``intense dispute'' over the conduct of the war within the
armed forces.
   On Thursday, Le Monde printed excerpts from Bazargan's letter to
Khomeini.
   ``In truth, for seven years Iran and Islam have become
synonymous in the world with hate and malice,'' the excerpt read.
``It is a shame and not an honor. ...
   ``When are you going to stop making commerce with the blood of
our martyrs?''
   Bani-Sadr said that among those arrested were Ali Ardalan, a
former finance minister, Husseini Shah Hussein, president of the
welcome committee when the exiled Khomeini returned to Iran in
1980; former Interior Minister Hachem Sabbaghian; and former
Justice and Interior Minister Ahmed Sadr Djavadi.

<HEAD>Kitty Dukakis Recovering After Surgery; Husband to Resume Campaign</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates throughout with more information about surgery,
Dukakis campaign plans and quotes.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis, wife of the Democratic presidential
front-runner, underwent five hours of delicate surgery Friday to
correct a spinal problem that doctors had feared could lead to
paralysis. Husband Michael Dukakis canceled campaign plans to be
with her.
   ``I talked to Kitty in the recovery room and she said she wanted
an ice cream and a massage,'' Dukakis said following the surgery.
``I'm prepared to provide both.''
   Dr. Lawrence Borges said, ``The operation went very well. There
were no problems at all.''
   Borges said Mrs. Dukakis would be in the intensive care unit
overnight, and would remain in Massachusetts General Hospital for
about a week. Doctors said she woke up immediately after the
operation.
   Surgeons removed two herniated discs from Mrs. Dukakis' neck and
replaced them with bone taken from her hip. She had been
experiencing pain and numbness fr several weeks and doctors
determined both problems were caused by dangerous pressure on her
spine because of the discs.
   Her husband, the Massachusetts governor, returned from
California Thursday night and spent the night in his wife's room at
the hospital.
   Dukakis said that if no complications developed from the
operation he would resume campaigning Saturday afternoon in New
Jersey. He said he planned to return to Boston Saturday night to
visit his wife again, then go back to New Jersey Sunday morning and
then head to California for campaigning through Tuesday, the last
day of the 1988 primary season.
   The governor canceled a debate Thursday with Democratic rival
Jesse Jackson to return to Boston, and he said he thought it
unlikely the debate would be rescheduled.
   New Jersey, California, New Mexico and Montana hold the final
Democratic presidential primaries Tuesday. Dukakis is favored to
win in all four states, gaining enough delegates to assure him the
Democratic nomination to face likely Republican nominee George Bush
in November.
   Mrs. Dukakis was campaigning in California on behalf of her
husband when she was diagnosed as having herniated discs. She
returned home Wednesday night for additional tests, and doctors
decided immediate surgery was the best course.
   Because she had more than one herniated disc and because the
problem was in her neck, doctors said waiting before correcting the
problem could lead to permanent nerve damage and possibly
paralysis. The discs serve as soft cushions between the bony
vertebrae that protect the spinal cord.
   After the surgery, her doctors said Mrs. Duakakis should regain
full mobility of her neck but would have to wear a cervical collar
for several weeks. She also likely will walk with a limp for
several weeks because of the surgery to remove the bone from her
hip.
   Mrs. Dukakis is considered to be in good overall health. Last
year she said she had been addicted to amphetamines for 26 years
before entering a drug clinic in 1982.

   A Harris County Democratic official says the
local party is $120,000 in debt, partly because contributions
dropped off after a follower of extremist Lyndon LaRouche was
elected chairman.
   While donations have begun flowing in again, a more extensive
fund-raising effort is planned, said party executive director Bill
Ramsey.
   Claude Jones, the LaRouche follower whose position as chairman
has been stripped of most of its power, is not being asked to
participate, Ramsey said.
   ``There was a fund-raising setback when Mr. Jones was elected
chairman because our traditional contributors wanted to be
reassured their contributions would not be going to him,'' said
Ramsey. ``I think his presence would be a detriment to
fund-raising.''
   Jones, who upset incumbent party chairman Larry Veselka in the
March 8 election, declined comment on the situation.

<HEAD>Kidneys From Family Members Always Better, Doctors Say</HEAD>

   Transplant patients fare much better with poorly
matched kidneys from living relatives than well-matched organs from
dead strangers, a finding that could spark more donations by family
members, doctors said Friday.
   The option is especially appealing, they said, because demand is
up but organ donation is down.
   ``There are a lot of people that can be helped that you would
otherwise have waiting in line,'' said Dr. Dixon Kaufman, a
transplant fellow at the University of Minneosta.
   ``The point is, don't just discount'' kidneys from family
members whose tissue does not properly match the recipient, he said
at the annual meeting of the American Society of Transplant
Surgeons.
   To do so is ``absolutely criminal,'' said John Najarian, a
transplant surgeon at the University of Minnesota.
   ``The very best cadaver kidney won't touch the worst
living-related donor. Never has, never will,'' Najarian said.
   The practice of removing one of two kidneys from a healthy
person for transplantation was common in the 1960s and 1970s
because of ineffective anti-rejection medication. But now that
therapy is improved and overall success rates are up, some doctors
contend it's not worth putting two people, the donor and recipient,
at risk.
   Although none of the living donors in Minnesota has suffered
major complications, there are reports of 20 fatalities worldwide
as a result of kidney donation.
   ``It would be nice if we had enough cadaver donors so we
wouldn't have to do living-related donors at all. But we don't,''
said Dr. Robert J. Corry of the University of Iowa.
   Of the 8,972 kidney transplants performed in 1987, down slightly
from the previous year, about a quarter of the organs were provided
by healthy family members, according to Dr. Barry Kahan, director
of organ transplantation at the University of Texas Medical School
at Houston.
   Although that's down considerably from years past, the numbers
could be headed back up as a result of the recent slide in organ
donation, Kahan said. At the same time, the number of those
awaiting a kidney transplant has continued to mount.
   For insular dependent diabetics, time is of particular
importance since they do not tolerate dialysis as well as others
with kidney failure.
   ``What the University of Minnesota has found is a logical
extension'' of how to deal with the shortage of organs from
brain-dead donors, Kahan said. ``We need to make family members
aware of the fact that donations from the living may be the most
efficient way to get transplanted.''
   Kaufman and his associates at Minnesota looked at the success
rates of 657 transplants performed from 1980 to 1987, 315 of them
involving organs from healthy brothers or sisters.
   Of the 149 instances in which the recipient got a perfectly
matched kidney from a sibling, the organs were functioning in 94
percent of the cases two years after surgery, Kaufman said. All six
antigens, or genetic markers, were shared by the donor and
recipient.
   The success rate was 91 percent for the 131 who received a
partially matched kidney, in which three to five antigens were
shared by the siblings. And it was 93 percent for the 35 who got an
organ from a sibling with only one or two antigens in common.
   That compared to an overall success rate of 74 percent for the
patients who received kidneys from brain-dead victims after waiting
up to several years, Kaufman said. The success rate climbed to 78
percent when four to six antigens were matched between donor and
recipient.
   Kaufman said researchers did not know why the lesser matched
kidneys from relatives did better than the ones with three to five
antigens in common.
   Despite the anomaly, Kaufman said the best-matched kidney should
be used, whether the selection is being made among a group of
relatives or the choice is among donor organs from dead strangers.
   ``It's prudent to use the best match in terms of living-related
donors, everyone being willing,'' he said.
   The findings are not meant to suggest ``in any way, shape or
form'' that it doesn't matter who the donor is as long as they're
alive and well, according to Kaufman.
   ``When you are related ... you are inheriting other chromosomes
that may have a beneficial effect on your kidney,'' he said.
``Whereas, somebody who is totally unrelated, just because they're
alive, may not pass along that added benefit. And in that case it
truly may not be any better than having a cadaver kidney.''

   The government gave awards to 15 leaders of the
Russian Orthodox Church on Friday, two days before they begin
celebrating the 1,000th anniversary of Christianity in what is now
the Soviet Union.
   Alexander Ogorodnikov, a Russian Orthodox dissident, said police
had prevented a Moldavian man from traveling to Moscow for an
unofficial commemoration of the millenium. Ogorodnikov also said
officials turned down his own request for space in the city to hold
unofficial alternative celebrations.
   Dissidents criticize church leaders for their close contacts
with the government, which controls church activity.
   A statement by President Andrei A. Gromyko, carried by the
official news agency Tass, awarded the Red Banner of Labor to the
Patriarch Pimen, leader of the church; Metropolitan Filaret of Kiev
and Galitsky, and two archbishops. Ten other leading clerics were
given the Order of Peoples' Friendship.
   Celebrations of the millenium, expected to bring thousands of
church officials and tourists to Moscow, begin Sunday with a
worship service in Epiphany Cathedral. They continue through June
13 in Moscow, then move to the former church centers of Kiev,
Vladimir and Leningrad.
   Ogorodnikov, a former political prisoner, plans seminars and
worship services in Moscow next week as alternatives to the
official celebration.
   He applied to the city for meeting space for the commemoration,
but said Friday he was refused.
   Yuri Rudenko of Kishinev, capital of Moldavia, was taken off a
train Thursday and stopped in a car Friday while trying to come to
Moscow, Ogorodnikov said.
   Rudenko was taken before a prosecutor in Kishinev and told he
was being investigated for slandering the situation of believers in
Moldavia, the dissident said.

   A site selection committee recommended Friday
that the headquarters of the 1.7 million-member United Church of
Christ be moved from New York City to Cleveland.
   ``The United Church of Christ has a rich presence in Cleveland,
which is representative of different ethnic strains and racial
composition,'' said the committee chairman, the Rev. John H.
Krueger of Fort Wayne, Ind. ``We were impressed with the way in
which the churches and the civic entities, private and public, all
seem to be cooperative and provide the environment in which people
live and work.''
   Delegates to the UCC's 16th General Synod a year ago asked the
panel to consider staying in New York or move to either Cleveland
or St. Louis, Mo.
   The decision won't become final until the church's next synod in
Fort Worth, Texas, in 1989, said spokeswoman Martha Gotwals.
   The move could mean as many as 310 new jobs for Cleveland, and
some members of the New York staff are expected to transfer, Ms.
Gotwals said. Some of UCC's leases in New York expire in 1989, she
said.
   Krueger said the next step for the committee will be to pick a
site in Cleveland. He said the group saw some properties when it
visited in March and the United Church may buy or lease a building
or construct a new building. The committee hopes to select a site
by next spring, he said.
   UCC has 167,914 members in Ohio, Ms. Gotwals said.
   More than a year ago, a previous headquarters location committee
suggested that the national headquarters be moved to St. Louis. It
then changed its recommendation to suggest only that the
headquarters be moved from New York by 1991.
   The decision was made more complicated at last summer's synod in
Cleveland, when David A. Jones, president of Humana Inc., offered
to lease office space in a Louisville, Ky., building he owns for $1
a year for 10 years. After 10 years, the space would have been
given to UCC.
   Before Louisville made its bid, the UCC's executive council had
considered Cleveland, Chicago, Indianapolis, New York and St.
Louis. But at last year's synod, the 700 delegates voted to limit
the cities being considered to Cleveland, New York and St. Louis.

   A small group of protesters staged a peaceful
demonstration on behalf of the homeless outside the Pentagon on
Friday, announcing similar rallies would be held in 34 other cities
on Saturday.
   The demonstration was mounted by a coalition led by the Jobs
With Peace Campaign, a Boston-based group which lists among its
advisory board Democratic presidential candidates Michael Dukakis
and Jesse Jackson; Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.; and Reps. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., and Don Edwards,
D-Calif. _ none of whom attended the rally.
   The new ``Build Homes, Not Bombs'' campaign is designed to
develop public support for cutting the defense budget and using the
funds to provide housing for the homeless.
   ``Over the past seven years, we've seen the military budget
double while funds for housing were cut by 78 pecent,'' said Ann
Wilson, a co-chairwoman of Jobs with Peace. ``We need to change
this situation.
   ``We can have peace with jobs, or we can have death with war,''
added Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women.
   Friday's demonstration, which lasted about 75 minutes, attracted
about 70 protesters and ended with the ``construction'' of a
prefabricated house on a Pentagon lawn.
   There were no incidents or arrests.

<HEAD>Williams Attorney: Parole Denial ``Doesn't Disappoint Us''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wayne Williams, convicted of two murders and
suspected of many more in the series of killings of young blacks
that rocked the city in 1979-81, lost his first chance at parole,
state officials announced Friday.
   The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles announced that it had
denied parole for Williams, 29, who is serving two life sentences
at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center in Jackson.
Spokesman Silas Moore said the board informed Williams of its
decision in a letter mailed Wednesday.
   Williams' attorney, Lynn Whatley, said the board's decision was
not disappointing because the board routinely denies parole on an
inmate's first review.
   ``I think it was done in a manner of course, what they do for
all inmates,'' Whatley said. ``It doesn't disappoint us, doesn't
take away our momentum.''
   Whatley said he and Williams are more concerned with appealing
his convictions for the murders of Nathaniel Cater and Jimmy Ray
Payne. There may be some action on Williams' appeal in Butts County
Superior Court during the summer, he said.
   ``We expect to be successful in the appellate court before the
end of the year,'' Whatley said. ``We have a tremendous amount of
suppressed evidence, and we intend to use it in court.''
   Williams, a free-lance photographer, was convicted Feb. 27,
1982, of two counts of murder in what had become known as the
Atlanta child slayings. He was not charged in the 27 other deaths
of young blacks that took place between 1979 and 1981, although 22
of the cases were closed and attributed to Williams after his
conviction.
   Georgia law requires that inmates serving life sentences
automatically be considered for parole after seven years. Williams,
who was arrested in June 1981, will be eligible for parole
consideration again in 1996, Moore said.
   ``You can be assured that it was the majority decision of the
board,'' Moore said, adding that the five-member board cited ``the
circumstances and nature of the offenses'' as reasons for denying
parole.

   Police Chief Robert O'Malley will never
forget the Great Phone Outage, like the morning he spent on a
cellular car phone trying to reach Fire Chief Stan Bulat, who was
parked just a few feet away.
   ``I guess everybody will have something to remember that outage
by, and that phone call to Stan will be mine,'' O'Malley said.
   Both were dependent on their cellular car telephones and kept
missing each other. When they finally hooked up, ``I said, `We need
to meet, where are you?' He said `Behind the fire station.' I said
`Me too,''' O'Malley recalled.
   ``That's when we realized we were parked just feet from each
other,'' on either side of a van, he said.
   ``Quite frankly, I'm glad it wasn't a crime wave _ or something
more serious like that.''
   At 12:01 a.m. CDT Sunday, about 35,000 customers in Hinsdale and
five other west Chicago suburbs are to be returned to full phone
service for the first time since a Mother's Day fire at a Illinois
Bell switching station.
   ``There hasn't been a lot to laugh about on this one. ... But
the people who worked there can deservedly feel some pride,'' said
Bell spokesman Tim Bannon.
   Some residential and business service, as well as
``pass-through'' telephone traffic from Chicago, Joliet and
elsewhere, has returned in stages. All that remains to be done
Sunday is to transfer customers still dependent on damaged
equipment to new gear.
   ``It will mean no more static, clicking or buzzing, no more
broken connections or any of the other meddlesome things that were
upsetting customers,'' Bannon said.
   As many as 250 workers worked 12-hour shifts at the site since
the May 8 fire, ``but we've cut back on that number, and we've even
given most of these people some days off,'' he said.
   Hannah Beube already misses those Bell workers.
   Many of them patronized her business, ``The Monogram Shop,'' one
of the few that actually prospered during the outage.
   ``They had us make up T-shirts with their names and titles on
them on the front and Hinsdale '88 on the back,'' said Ms. Beube.
   Few other shopkeepers in this quiet community of 16,700 will
share her fond memories.
   ``Business was off by 60 (percent) or 70 percent for about two
weeks,'' said Maria Rendon, co-owner of Jane and Maria's Flower
Shop. ``The first few days we filled existing orders and we
thought, `Maybe this won't be so bad.'
   ``Then we ran out of work to do and we started reorganizing
things. ... Then we started getting upset.''
   Although Illinois Bell has promised rebates, several businesses
were angry enough to file lawsuits charging the utility was
negligent in failing to staff the switching station, which houses
computerized equipment to connect local and long-distance calls.
Firefighters reached the scene 82 minutes after an alarm registered
at Bell's Springfield monitoring station.
   And Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan has filed a
complaint with the Illinois Commerce Commission seeking to have
Bell pick up the tab for financial losses.
   Some local governments face bills as high as $65,000 for police
overtime pay and emergency equipment, ``but we've had to ... show a
police presence, and I think everybody understands that,'' O'Malley
said.
   Hinsdale officials and some downtown merchants plan a promotion
and party June 18 to celebrate.
   ``We're doing the T-shirts,'' said Ms. Beube. ``They'll be
Illinois Bell's colors _ blue, white and a little gold _ and across
the front they'll say: `The Bells are Ringing in Hinsdale.'''

   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett
asked Congress on Friday to move quickly to keep alive a program
that allows the Internal Revenue Service to withhold tax refunds
from student loan defaulters.
   The government in the past three years has recovered $532
million from loan defaulters, but its authority to dock the tax
refunds expires June 30.
   ``It is critical that the Congress act quickly if this program
is to be kept alive,'' Bennett said in letters to the chairmen of
the House and Senate tax committees.
   He said his department and other agencies need to know by
mid-June if the authority will be extended in order to continue
carrying out offsets on 1987 tax returns and to gear up for the
next tax year.
   Bennett said that $213 million has been recovered so far this
fiscal year, $50 million more than it had anticipated. Collections
averaged $10 million a week during March, April and May. During the
second week of May, $16 million in refunds was withheld from 32,000
defaulters.
   The $532 million figure includes some money that defaulters paid
back voluntarily.

   The launch, scheduled for June 10, will not take place before
June 15, according to a spokesman for Arianespace, the commercial
arm of the European Space Agency. No new launch date was given.
   The launch will not carry anything for paying customers. It is
meant to show potential users the rocket's readiness for
operational flights, planned to begin in late 1988.
   Ariane 4 is the most powerful of the Ariane series of European

   It is able to vary the number of solid or liquid fuel booster
rockets and to adapt the upper portion of the launcher according to
the payload, increasing flexibility.

<HEAD>Vietnam Checking 32 Reports On Missing Americans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vietnam is investigating more than 30
cases that may involve Americans missing in action from the Vietnam
war, a U.S. military team that visited Hanoi said Friday.
   The team made the announcement after three days of talks with
Vietnamese government officials on accounting for a total of nearly
1,800 Americans missing from the war.
   ``The Vietnamese reported to us that they are now investigating
32 instances in which they have received information or remains
which could be associated with missing Americans,'' the team said
in a statement.
   ``Some of this investigative work is still in the preliminary
stages,'' it said. ``Consequently, no conclusions can be drawn at
this time from these investigations.''
   In the past, the Vietnamese often have followed up on such
announcements with returns of remains. The last return was on April
6, when Hanoi handed over 27 sets _ the largest such transfer since
U.S. forces withdrew from Vietnam in 1973.
   The American team said it provided specific information to the
Vietnamese and reviewed progress since technical specialists of the
two sides last met in March. The statement described this week's
meeting as ``positive and productive.''
   The five-man team was from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution
Center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu,
which are entrusted with resolving the fates of Americans missing
in foreign wars. It was led by Lt. Col. Paul Mather, head of the
resolution center's office in Bangkok.
   This week's meeting was the fifth since the two countries
reached an agreement in August under which Vietnam would accelerate
the MIA search and the United States would consider its requests
for humanitarian aid.
   Since then, Vietnam has complained that the Americans
misinterpreted the agreement and that it still wanted aid from the
U.S. government, not just from private agencies. The United States
has replied that it will not consider lifting an embargo on
official aid until Vietnamese troops leave Cambodia.

   Lebanese Justice Minister Nabih Berri on
Friday disbanded his Shiite Moslem Amal militia in all but southern
Lebanon after its defeat by pro-Iranian factions in Beirut's
southern slums, radio stations reported.
   They said Berri announced his decision at a news conference
barred to the international media and attended only by local
journalists at his heavily fortified house in Moslem west Beirut.
   The Syrian-armed Amal, Arabic for hope, suffered a crushing
defeat in south Beirut last month in a bloody three-week power
struggle with the fundamentalist Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God.
   Police said 296 people were killed and 1,000 wounded before an
estimated 2,400 Syrian troops were deployed to enforce a truce.
   Berri was quoted as saying he dissolved the military wing of the
Amal movement throughout Lebanon except for the southern region of
the country, where the militia had gained exclusive control after
defeating Hezbollah in a four-day confrontation in April.
   He instructed all Amal militiamen in Beirut and the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in east Lebanon to restrict their
activities to politics, banning them from carrying arms or engaging
in military confrontations, the radio reports said.
   He was quoted as saying the militia's central political office
in the Shiyah district of south Beirut would continue to function,
but all other military and other offices belonging to Amal would be
closed down.
   The exact size of the Amal faction is unknown. By police
estimates, 7,000 Amal militiamen battled Hezbollah, but the group
is said to be able to field an additional 3,000-4,000 men.

<TEXT>
   Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie, sentenced to life in
prison for the deportation of French Jews to Nazi death camps, lost
an appeal Friday on his conviction of crimes against humanity.
   Barbie, 74, known as the ``Butcher of Lyon,'' was convicted July
4, 1987 in the southeastern city of Lyon. He was sentenced to life
imprisonment, the maximum possible sentence in France.
   The Criminal Chamber of the Appeals Court, France's highest
court, rejected 14 separate arguments by defense attorneys in the
appeal.
   The court followed the recommendation of Advocate General Emile
Robert who had said despite two ``regrettable errors'' in the
trial, both technical, the appeal should be rejected.
   The charges against Barbie included the roundup and deportation
of French Jews _ including 44 children _ to concentration camps in
Germany.
   The appeals court ruling ends five years of legal proceedings
against Barbie that began in February 1983 when he was expelled
from Bolivia, where he was exiled, and brought to France.
   Barbie previously had been convicted of war crimes in absentia
during trials in 1952 and was sentenced to death. The statute of
limitations had run out on those sentences and he was brought to
trial again on charges of crimes against humanity, for which there
is no statute of limitations.
   Barbie is to spend the rest of his life at Lyon's St. Joseph
Prison, unless he eventually receives a pardon for medical reasons.

<TEXT>
   President Najib left Friday night for
Moscow with the selection of a new Afghan government still
undisclosed.
   Najib eight days ago announced his choice for a new prime
minister and instructed him to form a new Cabinet.
   The composition of a new government rests with the ruling
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. Its lack of haste in
announcing the ministers has prompted speculation in diplomatic
circles here that there are either divisions within the party or
efforts were being made to bring in outsiders who could at least
nominally be considered opposition members.
   Najib shook hands with members of his government and diplomats
during a red carpet send-off at Kabul airport, complete with
military band and honor guard with fixed bayonets.
   When asked by a reporter why the announcement of a Cabinet was
taking so long, the 41-year-old former secret police commander
said: ``It is not too late. After two days, everything will be
solved.''
   The president's departure was marked by the secrecy that
surrounds official government ceremonies in a country wracked by
war for the past decade. Although government officials had said
they expected Najib to fly to Moscow on Saturday morning, late
Friday afternoon they suddenly put out the word that the president
would leave within a few hours.
   The airport was guarded by Soviet troops as well as Afghan
security forces. The Soviets started withdrawing troops from
Afghanistan nearly three weeks ago, heralding the end of their
military intervention that began in 1979 to prop up a pro-Moscow
regime.
   Najib's choice for prime minister is Mohammad Hasan Sharq, who
is regarded as an amiable technocrat and a political survivor. He
has served as deputy prime minister and as minister for refugee
affairs to oversee the return of the more than 5 million Afghans
who fled the country during the war between Moslem guerrillas and
the Afghan army and its Soviet allies.
   Following his visit to Moscow, Najib was scheduled to travel to
New York to address the United Nations, followed by a visit to Cuba.

   Hearts and livers available for transplants are
going to waste, resulting in an untold loss of life, according to a
study.
   Doctors who tracked organs donated to a New York procurement
agency put the blame Friday on inefficiency and inadequate
resources.
   ``Everybody does their best, but the (transplant) system needs
to flow more smoothly,'' said Dr. John Ricotta, a kidney transplant
surgeon at the University of Rochester Medical Center.
   In a report to the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,
Ricotta said up to half of all suitable livers and hearts donated
to the University of Rochester Organ Procurement Program are being
wasted.
   He cited outdated national computer listings and the inability
to quickly find candidates of similar blood type and size as the
biggest obstacles to identifying recipients.
   ``If there's no (suitable) recipient, there's not much you can
do about that,'' Ricotta said. ``The bigger concern is that 50
percent of our calls could have been avoided'' with a better
placement system.
   About 475 people are awaiting liver transplants in the United
States, and nearly 900 others are awaiting new hearts, according to
the United Network for Organ Sharing. The Virginia-based
organization has a federal contract to run the national Organ
Procurement and Transplantation Network, which links by computer
all transplant centers and organ procurement agencies.
   No statistics are available regarding the number of organs that
are donated but go unused in the United States each year.
   But some doctors question whether as many as half of all donated
hearts and livers that could be transplanted are being buried
instead.
   ``One of the things they're calling wastage is simply the
absence of an appropriate recipient. That's not a wasted organ.
It's one that's just not used,'' said Dr. John McDonald, the
transplant society's president.
   The University of Rochester Organ Procurement Program began its
study about a year ago after experiencing considerable difficulty
in placing donated livers and hearts. Their donated kidneys were
being used at the medical center, which transplants only kidneys,
or within the region.
   Officials tracked all organs donated through the Rochester
program from January 1985 to October 1987, when a new scoring
system for allocating transplant organs became mandatory for United
Network of Organ Sharing members.
   During the period, 203 brain-dead patients were referred, of
which 74 proved medically suitable, Ricotta said. Families of the
74 patients were approached about the possibility of organ
donation, and consent was obtained for 68 kidney donations, 55
liver donations and 44 heart donations.
   By the time the organ-placement process was completed, 64 donors
were found to be ultimately suitable for kidney donation, 40 for
liver donation and 42 for heart donation, Ricotta said. One of the
kidney donors later proved to be medically unsuitable, reducing
that number to 63.
   Kidneys from all 63 donors were transplanted, but just 20 livers
and 23 hearts were used, the study said.
   Organ procurement coordinator Richard Kruk said he and others at
the University of Rochester Organ Procurement Program made 411
telephone calls in an attempt to place the 39 unused hearts and
livers, which were never removed from the donors' bodies.
   Some transplant centers said they preferred waiting for a
locally procured donor, while others said they didn't think the
organs suited their needs. Still others said that they didn't have
a team available to retrieve the organs or that there wasn't any
room in the intensive-care unit.
   In some cases, more than 22 hours were spent trying to place a
donor's kidney, liver and heart. But the toughest job, by far, was
telling families their loved ones' organs couldn't be used, Kruk
said.
   ``Because the spirit of organ donation is altruistic, because
the next of kin are making a decision for the common good, you
don't wan't to lead them to believe the common good isn't being
served,'' he said. ``It is being served. It's only that it could be
better served.''

would go toward emergency shelters, food, health care, education
and job training.
   Although the bill originally authorized $735.9 million for
fiscal year 1990, an amendment changed the money figure to ``such
funds as necessary.''
   The banking subcommittee approved the entire bill but authorized
spending for only the housing provisions. It set that total at $297
million. Other House committees previously had voted on separate
portions of the measure.
   The Senate Banking Committee has approved $280 million for the
housing programs. No other committee in the Senate has acted yet on
the health and education, agriculture and veterans programs.
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R Utah,
site to be considered for the improved rockets, which are expected
to be introduced in the next decade.
   Hercules Inc. of Magna, Utah, together with Atlantic Research
Corp. of Gainesville, Va., proposed a site eight miles west of
Montgomery, Ala.
   At stake are a $1.2 billion plant and the employment a contract
would bring for a decade or more. The advanced rockets are expected
to arrive in the mid-1990s and replace the current boosters
completely in 1997.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced in
April that it would issue a request for proposals this month or
next from private industry to make the rocket in a new
government-owned facility to be built on a government-owned site.
   However, NASA said Friday, companies also were told they could
submit an optional proposal for a privately owned rocket facility
to be located at a site of the company's choice. Interested
companies were given until May 31 to notify NASA if they wanted to
pursue that course.
   As a result, NASA said, it received the responses from Thikol
and Hercules-Atlantic Research.
   ``When the official request for proposals is issued, a
government site will be specified as a tentative location for all
companies to use as a common basis for proposals,'' NASA said.
``The option of submitting an additional proposal for a privately
owned facility will now be open only to Hercules-Atlantic Research
and Morton Thiokol.''
   Three government owned sites are being evaluated, NASA said.
They are at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Stennis
Space Center in Bay St. Louis, Miss., and a Tennessee Valley
Authority property known as the Yellow Creek site, in northeastern
Mississippi.

<HEAD>No Evidence of Ovarian Cysts From Multiple-Dosage Birth Control
Pills</HEAD>

   There is not enough evidence to determine
whether the latest generation of birth control pills contributes to
non-cancerous ovarian cysts as some doctors suspect, a Food and
Drug Administration panel concluded Friday.
   But the agency's outside advisory committee on fertility and
maternal health drugs said it backs further studies already ordered
by the FDA to gather more data on the question.
   A Los Angeles physician who was instrumental in first raising
the issue said following Friday's hearing that he never has claimed
to have more than anecdotal evidence _ from his own practice and
other doctors who contacted him.
   ``Obviously, we don't have the answers yet,'' Dr. James C.
Caillouette said in an interview. ``The data has not been developed
yet. I am pleased they (the committee) recognized there is a
potential problem.''
   The FDA already has instructed the three companies that sell the
multiple-dosage, or triphasic, birth control pills to undertake
studies to determine whether there is a higher incidence of
functional ovarian cysts among women taking the new type pills.
   None of the three has filed its study plans with the FDA, but
such Phase IV studies typically involve post-market monitoring of
the medical records of large numbers of patients _ perhaps
thousands _ using a particular drug.
   Dr. Ridgely C. Bennett of the FDA told the advisory panel the
agency also was in the first stages of a larger study looking at
California Medicaid recipients taking different types of birth
control pills.
   There is no indication when any of those studies will be
completed.
   Meanwhile, there is no change in the status of the four
triphasic pills, which have carved out about a third of the total
birth control pill market since their introduction in 1984.
   FDA figures presented at the hearing showed that one triphasic
alone _ Ortho-Novum 7@7@7 _ is the No. 1 seller, with 17.6 percent
of the market as of last March. The other triphasics are Triphasil,
with 9.5 percent market share; Tri-Norinyl, with 3.6 percent; and
Tri-Levlen, with 2.6 percent.
   In all, it is estimated that more than 50 million American women
take some type of oral contraceptive.
   Caillouette, a professor of gynecology at the University of
Southern California School of Medicine, said he remains convinced
that the single-dose pills are safer than the multiphasic versions.
   ``I still have strong feelings that we have pills that in my
experience are safer than the multiphasics,'' he said.
   A triphasic comes in three different colors denoting their
different dose levels. A woman taking such a prescription would
take one color pill on certain days of the month and the other
colors on other days.
   Representatives for the three U.S. companies that market
triphasics _ Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., Wyeth Laboratories Inc.
and Syntex Corp. _ all say they are convinced of the pills' safety,
but are cooperating with the FDA-ordered studies.
   The other three major U.S. distributors of birth control pills
sell only single-dose versions.
   Caillouette became concerned about two years ago when he had
seven patients develop ovarian cysts within four months and
realized he had prescriped the new multiphasic for each of them.
   When he returned them to higher-dose monophasic prescriptions,
the cysts went away, he said.
   Since publishing a paper on his own experience in a medical
journal last summer, Caillouette said he has received similar
accounts from other doctors and now knows of 74 cases of ovarian
cysts that may be linked to multiphasic birth control pills.
   Although not life-threatening, ovarian cysts sometimes have to
be removed surgically and some women lose an ovary in the process.

   A young man who was wounded by a
gun-toting baby sitter on a shooting spree after he tried to calm
and disarm her said Friday he was neither angry nor fearful because
his assailant was ``a sick individual.''
   ``It was a freak incident,'' said Philip Andrew, 20, at a
Highland Park Hospital news conference. It was his first public
comment on the shooting two weeks ago, when 30-year-old Laurie Dann
went on a rampage in his hometown of Winnetka, a suburb north of
Chicago.
   Ms. Dann burst into the home of the Andrew family, whom she did
not know, on May 20 after shooting six children, one fatally, at
the nearby Hubbard Woods Elementary School. After shooting Andrew,
Ms. Dann fatally shot herself while police surrounded the home.
   ``The only way to really explain it is that this was a sick
individual,'' said Andrew, who was in fair condition recovering
from a chest wound. ``You can't make sense of it. ... The rest of
the people that come into my house aren't going to be shooting at
me.''
   Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., issued a statement Friday calling
Andrew ``an authentic hero'' for trying to disarm Ms. Dann. Andrew
was to have started working this week as an intern in Porter's
office in the suburb of Deerfield.
   The University of Illinois senior, a history major and swim team
captain, turned aside the accolade.
   ``I wasn't forcing myself to do anything,'' he said. ``I think I
acted just naturally in that situation. I don't think I did
anything really heroic.''
   In addition to Andrew, one of the five wounded children remains
hospitalized.
   Andrew was in the kitchen with his mother when Ms. Dann burst in
the back door, saying she had been sexually assaulted and had shot
her assailant.
   In the 40 to 50 minutes while she was in their house, Andrew
said he and his parents tried to calm Ms. Dann and persuade her to
call police. He said they also tried to persuade her to give up her
guns.
   ``We continued to talk to her. I explained to her that I was
familiar with the system and what was going to happen and I told
her I was going to stay with her. I was close enough to put my arms
around her. I was touching her,'' Andrew said.
   ``It was going through my head that I could take the gun from
her, but I thought it was best at this point that she just give it
up. And I thought ... she would,'' he said.
   Andrew finally decided to take one of the guns when Ms. Dann set
them both on a table, but she became agitated and more possessive
about the other weapon, he said.
   He said his mother left to warn his sisters not to enter the
house, and to call police.
   Then Andrew and his father decided they would leave, too, but
Ms. Dann raised her remaining pistol and told him to stay, he said.
   Then she may have seen a police officer, Andrew said, because
she suddenly turned around and shot him.
   Andrew said he didn't learn until after surgery that Ms. Dann
had fired shots in the nearby elementary school.

   President Reagan, reporting on summit talks in
Moscow, said today that Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ``a
serious man seeking serious reform,'' but that the Soviet Union
still should be viewed with caution.
   ``Let us embrace honest change when it occurs; but let us also
be wary. Let us stay strong,'' Reagan said in the address.
   The president also said the West must continue to speak out
about human rights conditions in the Soviet Union. ``In matter of
state, unless the truth be spoken, it ceases to exist,'' he said.
   Winding up a 10-day journey that included five days in the
Soviet capital, Reagan gave his summit assessment in a speech
before the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Guildhall, a
center of civic government for more than 1,000 years.
   The speech was a rhetorical highlight of the trip, offering
encouragement for Gorbachev's campaigns of ``Perestroika'' and
``glasnost,'' reforms, while expressing cautious hope for ``a new
era in history.''
   At the Guildhall, Reagan passed along a corridor lined with the
Lord Mayor Sir Greville Spratt's personal guard of pikemen and
musketeers. He was preceded by ceremonial sword and mace bearers
into the wood-paneled Great Hall where he delivered the speech.
   After a farewell to U.S. Embassy families here, Reagan and his
wife Nancy flew from London aboard Air Force One to Washington and
received a warm welcoming ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base, Md.
   The White House distributed 4,000 tickets for the ceremony to
members of the Republican National Committee, congressional
families, White House staff members and their families and
political appointees.
   The Air Force Ceremonial Band played martial music for an hour
before the arrival and the spectators displayed signs reading,
``Another One for the Gipper,'' ``There You Go Again'' and
``Welcome Home.''
   Reagan's four days of talks with Gorbachev did not produce any
breakthrough on a strategic arms reduction treaty, though both
sides said some key differences had been narrowed. Nevertheless,
the two leaders displayed a warm personal relationship.
   Reagan said the Soviet Union is dominated now by talk of
democratic reform, in the economy, in political institutions, and
in religious, social and artistic life _ ``in short, giving
individuals more freedom to run their own affairs, to control their
own destinies.
   ``To those of us familiar with the post-war era, all of this is
cause for shaking head in wonder,'' Reagan said, expressing
amazement about an American president and a Soviet leader walking
together in Red Square, as he and Gorbachev did, talking about ``a
growing personal friendship and meeting.''
   He said that episode was ``a special moment in a week of special
moments.''
   ``My personal impression of Mr. Gorbachev is that he is a
serious man seeking serious reform,'' Reagan said. ``I pray that
the hand of the Lord will be on the Soviet people.''
   He said the strategy of the West for dealing with the Soviets
was ``bearing fruit.
   `Quite possibly, we are beginning to take down the barriers of
the post-war era, quite possibly we are entering a new era in
history, a time of lasting change in the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   ``We will have to see,'' the president said. ``But if so, it is
because of the steadfastness of the allies _ the democracies _ for
more than 40 years, and especially in this decade.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking after Reagan, said,
``We warmly congratulate you and General Secretary Gorbachev on a
very successful summit, one which will influence the course of
history for years to come.''
   She also thanked Reagan for pushing the human rights issue,
saying, ``your words in Moscow will have shone like a beacon of
hope for all those wherever they are who are denied their basic
freedoms.''
   Reagan suggested he would continue to speak out against human
rights abuses in the Soviet Union and elsewhere.
   ``We have learned the first objective of the adversaries of
freedom is to make free nations question their own faith in
freedom, to make us think that adhering to our principles and
speaking out against human rights abuses or foreign aggression is
somehow an act of belligerence ...
   ``In matters of state,'' he said, ``unless the truth be spoken,
it ceases to exist.''
   Despite the impasse on a START treaty, Reagan spoke
optimistically about chances for getting an agreement.
   ``We made tangible progress toward the START treaty on strategic
weapons,'' the president said. ``Such a treaty, with all its
implications, is, I believe, now within our grasp.''
   However, he said, there are other elements as important as arms
negotations.
   ``As I never tire of saying, nations do not distrust each other
because they are armed; they are armed because they distrust each
other,'' Reagan said. ``So equally important items on the agenda
(in Moscow) dealt with critical issues, like regional conflicts,
human rights and bilateral exchanges.''
   Despite some progress, American negotiators say the two sides
made no progress on some of the thorniest areas of dispute:
sea-launched cruise missiles and the longstanding difference over
Reagan's Star Wars missile defense system.
   In his speech, Reagan paid a special Mrs. Thatcher, his close
friend and ally, noting that she had been among the first to
suggest the West could ``do business'' with Gorbachev.
   ``At this hour in history, prime minister, the entire world
salutes you and your gallant people and gallant nation.''
   Underscoring the theme of human rights he trumpeted in the
Soviet Union, Reagan said, ``the best indicator of how much we care
about freedom is what we say about freedom; it is in this sense,
words truly are actions.''
   After the speech, Reagan retuned to the ambassador's residence
for a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   As a half-dozen members of the Japanese parliament looked on,
reporters questioned Reagan during a picture-taking session on the
back terrace of the Winfield House.
   Asked if he were going to discuss trade with Takeshita, Reagan
said ``could be.''
   Asked whether he and Gorbachev had discussed the Seoul olympics,
he said ``that did not come up.''
   After about three minutes, Reagan told reporters, ``We have to
go to work. Why don't you take the rest of the day off.''
   Someone asked Reagan to comment on whether Gorbachev felt that
he had abused Soviet hospitality by speaking out on human rights in
Moscow.
   ``He didn't give me any indication that he felt that way and we
do think it is an important topic between us.''
   Asked if Gorbachev does not, in fact, set the tone for human
rights in the Soviet Union, Reagan said, ``it's that entire system,
you can't put the blame on one individual.''
   Asked if Gorbachev intended to press forward with opening up the
Soviet Union further he said ``he very definitely intends to go
forward and it's a definite improvement. We parted in a very
friendly manner.''
   On Thursday, Queen Elizabeth II entertained him with tea at
Buckingham Palace, a band played tunes written by 100-year-old
American songmaster Irving Berlin and Mrs. Thatcher saluted
Reagan's ``tremendous success'' at his summit which, she said,
heralds ``a new era in East-West relations.''

   A 16-year-old boy was sentenced Friday
to 206 years in prison for killing a high school teacher and
wounding three other people in a shooting he said stemmed from a
failing grade in French.
   District Judge Peter Rapkoch imposed consecutive 100-year terms
on 16-year-old Kristofor Hans for the murder of substitute teacher
Henrietta Smith and the attempted murder of Lewiston High School
Assistant Principal John Mofatt. He then added three years to each
for use of a weapon. Two students also were wounded in the December
1986 shootings.
   Besides the two consecutive 100-year terms, Rapkoch sentenced
the youth to concurrent 10-year sentences for each of the assault
charges involving the other students, who were hit with bullet
fragments. Rapkoch also added three years to each count for use of
a weapon.
   Hans, who pleaded guilty, said he intended to kill his French
teacher, Lavonne Simonfy, because she was giving him a failing
grade. That would have meant, under terms of an agreement with his
separated parents, that he had to leave his mother's home in
Lewistown and go to live with his father in Casper, Wyo.
   Smith was filling in that day for Simonfy and was shot as she
opened the door of Simonfy's classroom.

<HEAD>Surgery Repairs Mrs. Dukakis' Spinal Damage</HEAD>

   Surgery performed Friday on Kitty Dukakis repaired
spinal damage that probably resulted from a lifetime of modern
dance, her surgeon said.
   In the five-hour operation, doctors removed two discs in her
neck and replaced them with bone taken from her left hip.
   Mrs. Dukakis, wife of Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis, began to suffer some numbness over the past three
or four weeks. Diagnostic tests showed that two discs had ruptured
and were pressing on her spinal column.
   This is a dangerous condition that, if uncorrected, could have
left her paralyzed from the shoulders down.
   Dr. Nicholas T. Zervas, chief of neurosurgery at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston, said the damage probably happened years
ago but worsened over the past month.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 51, studied and taught modern dance for three
decades.
   ``She was an athletic dancer when she was younger,'' said
Zervas. ``She described certain things she would do that caused
extension of the neck that quite likely could cause some
degeneration of the ligaments and bones and later on cause an
actual hernia of the disc.''
   Spinal discs act as cushions that separate the vertebrae that
cover and protect the spinal cord. Problems occur when the discs
squeeze out of place, causing pain, tingling and other symptoms.
   Such herniated discs _ also called slipped, ruptured or
prolapsed discs _ are relatively common. Usually, however, they
occur in the lower back and don't endanger the spine.
   Mrs. Dukakis's case, however, was more serious. She had suffered
two ruptured discs in her neck, and the broken discs were pressing
on her spine.
   ``Given her problem with the discs pressing directly on the
spinal cord, we were concerned with her losing spinal cord
function,'' said Dr. Lawrence Borges, the principal surgeon. ``In
its worse situation, that could mean paralysis from the shoulders
down.''
   The doctors began the surgery by making a cut in the left side
of Mrs. Dukakis's neck just above the collar bone. Then they went
straight back toward the front of the spine.
   There they found two discs broken into fragments and pushing
into the spine, just as magnetic and X-ray scans had shown.
   ``The discs were removed from the front and cleaned out using
the operating microscope all the way back to the front of the
spinal cord,'' said Borges.
   ``At that point, Dr. (Frederick) Mansfield placed two pieces of
bone, one in each space, taken from the left hip to take the place
where the discs had been,'' Borges said. ``These were fused
together to make a nice, stable construct along the neck.''
   By fusing the spine this way, the doctors helped stabilize the
spine, protect the nerves and minimize the chance of pain.
   Borges said Mrs. Dukakis should notice very little limitation in
her ability to move her neck.
   The doctors said she will have to wear a cervical collar for six
to eight weeks until the bone grafts heal. She will also limp for a
few weeks until her hip heals.
   ``The prognosis at this point should be excellent,'' said
Borges. ``We anticipate no problems.''
   Zervas said Mrs. Dukakis noticed immediate improvement when she
woke up after the surgery.
   ``She told me that the numbness and tingling she had all over
her body had disappeared,'' he said, ``and that makes us feel
good.''

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Sam Steiger on Friday was
placed on four years' probation and fined $5,480 for pressuring a
parole board member over an administrative matter while working for
then-Gov. Evan Mecham.
   Judge Ronald Reinstein of Maricopa County Superior Court also
ordered him to perform 700 hours of community service work and
suggested Steiger, who is well known for criticizing lawyers,
consider spending some of those hours on Arizona Bar Association
projects.
   Steiger, 59, was convicted April 7 of theft by extortion in
threatening Board of Pardons and Paroles member Ron Johnson over a
personnel vote. He could have been sentenced to up to five years in
prison.
   Steiger claimed it was simply hardball politics, but jurors at
the seven-day trial agreed with the prosecution that Steiger
threatened Johnson's part-time job as a justice of the peace ``in
order to steal his vote'' on retention of the board's executive
director.
   Steiger clashed repeatedly with Attorney General Bob Corbin
while a special assistant to Mecham, who has since been impeached.
   He told the judge he was frustrated by problems at the parole
board and could not say he regretted his actions even though
``prudence and precedence would dictate that I should be
remorseful.''
   Referring to interviews with Corbin investigators, he said: ``I
lied to the attorney general for the same reason that I would lie
to a stick-up man in an alley who asked me if I had any money. .. .
What is important in this matter is that it is my absolute, honest
conviction that the attorney general singled me out for elimination
from state government because I was critical of a serious problem
in that office.''
   Reinstein said he was impressed by the more than 170 letters on
Steiger's behalf and said he did not believe Steiger was motivated
by political, financial or personal gain.
   But he said Steiger ``clearly broke the law,'' abused his power
and was trying to ``deflect your obvious wrong in this case'' on
others.
   ``Frankly, Mr. Steiger, you came off as a bully,'' Reinstein
said, citing conversations that the parole board member secretly
recorded.
   Steiger, a former five-term congressman, rancher and newspaper
columnist has taken on his colleagues, neighbors, business
associates, former wife, police, highway officials and burros in a
colorful career.
   Steiger began his political career at 28 as a Republican, when
he won the first of two terms in the state Senate from a 10-1
Democratic district.
   ``The only reason a Republican had never been elected was
because nobody good had ever run,'' he said later. ``Everybody
laughed. After all, who's gonna vote for a New York Jew
horse-trader who was a Republican on top of everything else?''
   In a 1968 television interview he referred to some of his
congressional colleagues as ``dumb clucks I wouldn't hire to push a
wheelbarrow.'' In 1975 he shot and killed two burros that he said
attacked him.
   In 1979, Steiger pointed a rifle at a man who tried to collect a
debt at his ranch. In 1982, he was convicted of disorderly conduct
after directing ``abrasive and abusive'' language toward a Highway
Patrol officer.
   In 1986, he repainted a crosswalk that the state highway
department had eliminated in downtown Prescott and later beat a
criminal-damage charge in the case.
   As a special assistant to Mecham the next year, he was in charge
of overseeing the highway department. The crosswalk was painted
again, this time by highway crews.

   Deputy police commissioner Willie L.
Williams is the first black to win the department's top job, with
the 24-year police veteran pledging Friday to carry on reforms
begun by outgoing Commissioner Kevin Tucker.
   Williams, 44, will take over next week when Tucker's resignation
becomes effective. He said he would prepare the department ``to
enter the 21st century.''
   ``We will also have honor and integrity as the cornerstone of
our every working hour,'' Williams said at a news conference where
Mayor W. Wilson Goode announced his appointment.
   Tucker resigned last week after a 2{-year tenure marked by
efforts to improve the credibility of a police force rocked by
extortion scandals in recent years. He had suggested Williams and
six other candidates for the job, Goode said.
   ``The tenure of Kevin Tucker has represented the turning around
of this department and the appointment of Willie Williams
represents a continuation of the reform of the department,'' Goode
said.
   Goode, the city's first black mayor, had said the new
commissioner would come from within the department.
   Budget cuts have prompted speculation of layoffs in the police
department, and Williams told reporters ``the patrol force on the
street will not be cut. That is our first priority.''
   City Council President Joseph Coleman called the appointment
``magnificent. He is a good man and is very qualified.''
   Robert Hurst, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge
5, said the union was pleased, ``especially that the mayor named
someone from within who had worked his way up through the ranks.''
   Williams, who started with the 6,700-member department in 1964
as a park guard, was chosen by Tucker as a deputy commissioner. In
that role, he was responsible for the operations of the
administrative, training and staff services bureaus.
   Both Williams and Goode said the major task facing the police
department is the fight against drugs and that the battle would be
stepped up.
   Goode, asked if appointing a black police commissioner would
help the image of police in the black community, responded that
``race was never a factor in this appointment. ... I only sought to
find the very best person.''
   He acknowledged, however, that in the black community, which
comprises about 40 percent of the city's population, Williams will
be able to help turn around negative views of police.
   Tucker, 47, a former head of the local U.S. Secret Service
office, succeeded Gregore Sambor, who resigned in the wake of the
fatal May 1985 confrontation between police and the radical group
MOVE and was commissioner during federal investigations of
extortion by police officers.
   Tucker took over a morale-shattered department that was reeling
from extortion convictions against 34 officers or former officers,
including a deputy commissioner.

<HEAD>Bank Robbers Threaten To Kill Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men who muffed a bank robbery
in a southern town threatened Friday to start killing their 12
remaining hostages if their demands for money and an escape car
were not met, police reported.
   Four other hostages slipped out of the bank through a bathroom
window early Friday, said officials in Goioere, a town of 30,000
about 550 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro in Parana state. Ten
others were released after the men holed up in the bank Thursday
afternoon.
   Police chief Guaraci Abreu said the two men were young ``and
very professional. They know what they want.''
   He said the gunmen had doubled their cash demand to the
equivalent of $100,000 and wanted a car without license plates.
``Otherwise they said they would start killing hostages one by one,
and I believe them,'' he said by telephone.
   Justice Secretary Antonio Lopes Noronha, heading a negotiating
team, suspended payment of the ransom even though the money had
been collected from other banks.
   ``We won't try to storm the bank because we do not want to risk
hostages' lives, but we won't pay either. We'll just sit tight and
wait,'' he told reporters.
   The bandits, each armed with two revolvers, entered the Bank of
Brazil branch minutes before closing Thursday afternoon and
overpowered two guards, then the alarm sounded and police arrived
moments later.
   After the guards and 24 other employees were taken hostage,
about 150 state troopers and municipal police surrounded the bank.
   On Thursday night the gunmen released the two guards and seven
female bank tellers. They also freed a sick man.
   Bank holdups have increased in Brazil, where inflation is
running at a projected annual rate of 600 percent. Police often
have allowed robbers to flee in order to save the lives of hostages.

<HEAD>Cuba Gives Faint Praise to Reagan, an `Implacable Enemy'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cuba gave President Reagan faint praise
Friday for his arms treaty with the Soviet Union, but also said he
is an ``implacable enemy'' and demanded the U.S. Navy base at
Guantanamo be returned.
   King Hussein of Jordan told delegates to the special General
Assembly session on disarmament that Israel poses ``a terrible
threat'' to the Middle East and the world with nuclear weapons.
Israel neither confirms nor denies reports that it has nuclear arms.
   Cuban Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez assailed
Washington's military policies and economic embargo of his
Caribbean nation. But Rodriguez also said this week's U.S.-Soviet
summit in Moscow and the treaty on eliminating intermediate-range
nuclear missiles represents ``an auspicious sign'' for the U.N.
session.
   ``We have the possibility of seeing a profound change in
international political relations,'' and the time when some U.S.
leaders thought their ends ``could be achieved through a policy of
force and arrogance has given way to laborious, systematic
negotiations,'' Rodriguez said.
   He said a positive response from the United States is required
to accompany Soviet initiatives and the international clamor for
peace. ``And the latest events seem to indicate that the Reagan
administration is heading in that direction.
   ``If Mr. Reagan takes the road to peace, no matter how
vacillating his manner or slow his steps, Cuba ... would not .. .
fail to recognize that positive attitude on his part,'' Rodriguez
said.
   He added, however, that Cuba still ``considers him (Reagan) its
implacable adversary, cannot forget his threats and is not yet free
of his economic and political pressures.''
   Rodriguez said military bases maintained by foreign powers
``constitute a virtual rental of national sovereignty of countries
eaten away by poverty.''
   Guantanamo is ``the most intolerable example'' of foreign
military presence, he said, adding: ``The U.S. occupiers imposed it
on our country and although our people are opposed, it is still
there and an insult to our national sovereignty.
   ``Cuba has not accepted it, cannot accept it and will never
accept it. That part of our national territory should be returned
to us.''
   The United States leased the base area on Guantanamo Bay for 99
years in 1898. President Fidel Castro's government refuses the
nominal annual rent of $5,000.
   Rodriguez said Cuba has no offensive weapons and wants only the
minimum armaments necessary to guarantee its own peace, but must
make its defense plans ``taking into account the uninterrupted
hostility of the nearby United States.''
   That has ``forced us to turn the war waged by the army into a
`war of all the people,' involving old people, housewives and
children,'' he said.
   In a speech read by Ambassador Abdullah Salah of Jordan, King
Hussein recommended strong U.N. measures to keep the Middle East
free of nuclear weapons and halt Israel's alleged nuclear arms
program.
   ``The situation has become more dangerous since Israel
introduced nuclear weapons to the Middle East,'' Salah said. ``It
has been building up its nuclear capabilities since the 1950s and
is continuing to develop and expand them so that it now represents
a terrible threat not only to the Middle East but to the world as a
whole.''

<HEAD>Even For Close Friends, An Emotional Farewell</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 5 grafs with Thatcher-Kinnock comment, edits throughout
to tighten</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even for close friends, it was an emotional
farewell.
   Ronald Reagan, ending what was probably his last presidential
visit to Britain, quoted poetry Friday, joked about his age,
recalled Anglo-American alliances in war and peace and lavished
praise on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   And in the splendid setting of London's ancient Guildhall, seat
of city government for 1,000 years, Mrs. Thatcher responded, ``You
have restored faith in the American dream.''
   From red double-decker buses, the banks of the River Thames and
behind crowd barriers near the Guildhall, Londoners waved to the
U.S. president as his motorcade wound through the capital toward
the end of a 26-hour stopover after the Moscow summit.
   Eight British theater celebrities, including actress Julie
Christie, staged a demonstration against U.S. policy in Latin
America.
   But the only serious booing came from a crowd that had waited as
long as two hours outside the Guildhall for the arrival of Reagan
and his wife, Nancy _ and had their view blocked at the last moment
by a security van driven across the entrance to the courtyard.
   The 77-year-old Reagan delivered a speech focused on East-West
relations before an audience of 500 red-robed city dignitaries,
political leaders and diplomats.
   Yet, more than an political event, the occasion was a high point
in the special relationship between Britain and America, which has
flourished under the two conservative leaders who have held office
through the 1980s.
   The audience gave Reagan a standing ovation and, replying to his
speech, Mrs. Thatcher mixed praised for a political ally with
affection for a departing friend.
   ``Your personal courage, your gentle humor and your spirit of
optimism are all part of the special quality that you have brought
to the presidency,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, 62, into her third term
and expected to run for a fourth.
   ``Above all, and in this you have done the greatest possible
service not only to your own people but to free people everywhere,
you have restored faith in the American dream.''
   To a blast from gold-uniformed trumpeters, Reagan was escorted
into the Guildhall's Great Hall where towering statues of military
heroes Horatio Nelson and the Duke of Wellington are set amid
medieval stained-glass windows. The Stars and Stripes and the red
and white flag of St. George, England's patron saint, hung from
balconies.
   The Guildhall has been the scene of 16th century trials of
traitors, pleas to kings and Parliament, receptions for emperors _
and addresses by American presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Woodrow
Wilson.
   ``I wonder if you can imagine what it is for an American to
stand in this place,'' said Reagan.
   ``Back in the States, we are terribly proud of anything more
than a few hundred years old; some even see my election to the
presidency as America's attempt to show our European cousins that
we too have a regard for antiquity,'' he added, to laughter.
   After the jokes he concentrated on new hopes for peace and
another arms control treaty. And he intertwined history and
anecdotes to depict Britain: the country that produced Winston
Churchill, writer Evelyn Waugh and a pub-keeper who, hearing the
visiting Reagan's accent 40 years ago, recalled fondly the World
War II GIs sent to Britain ``from a place called Ioway.''
   Turning to Mrs. Thatcher, he said, ``At this hour in our
history, Prime Minister, the entire world salutes you and your
gallant people and gallant nation.''
   British opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, who
advocates unilateral disarmament, including shutting down U.S.
nuclear bases, and who describes Mrs. Thatcher as ``Reagan's
poodle,'' stared ahead expressionlessly from the rows of VIPs as
the president denounced one-sided disarmers.
   Kinnock said later of Reagan's tributes to Mrs. Thatcher, ``It
was a generous and gentlemanly thing to do. But I think that's
about where it stops.''
   Both Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher started out in office denouncing
the Soviet Union and both changed their minds through arms control
deals and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's new policies of
openness. Both spoke Friday of the dawn of new era of hope between
East and West.
   Reagan concluded, ```Come, my friends,' as it was said of old by
Tennyson, `it is not too late to seek a newer world.'''
   Responded Mrs. Thatcher, ``Thank you Mr. President. Thank you
for the summit, thank you for your presidency, thank you for your
testament of belief, and God bless America.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said later that she hoped Gorbachev would visit
Britain again in the spring or summer next year. In an interview
with Independent Television News, the prime minister said, ``He is
willing to do it and it is a question of what is the best timing.
... He will be very preoccupied with the changes going on in the
Soviet Union.''
   Kinnock later praised Reagan in an Independent Television News
interview: ``He deserves very full credit from our generation and
from future generations for making a positive response to
Gorbachev's initiatives.
   Asked whether he considered Reagan a great president, Kinnock
replied: ``Yes. I think Mrs Thatcher may be engaging in a mutual
match of hyperbole at the moment but it certainly is a highly
creditable performance in order to begin an era of nuclear
disarmament.
   ``She has over these nearly eight years now followed every twist
and turn and U-turn of American policy,'' he added. ``The least she
could expect is a public thank you from the president.
   ``She earned it, she deserved it from him and he gave it, which
was the presidential and gentlemanly thing to do.''

<HEAD>Reform Advocates Put Back on Ballot by Moscow Party Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moscow party leadership put prominent
advocates of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms back on the ballot
Friday for a key national Communist Party conference, the official
Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   It was a clear defeat for party conservatives.
   The Moscow party bureau sidestepped a decision of lower party
organizations in the capital, which had not submitted the names of
the reform advocates as candidates for the 19th Party Conference,
scheduled to open June 28.
   The conference is supposed to bolster Gorbachev's reforms by
approving a document published a week ago that outlines radical
changes to remove remnants of Stalinism from Soviet politics and
law. But reforms could be in doubt if conservatives are predominant
among delegates.
   Tass said Gorbachev, the party general secretary, took part in
the Moscow committee meeting, but did not say if he spoke in favor
of the restored candidacies.
   It did not say if those whose names were restored had been
elected, but the Moscow party committee would be unlikely to buck a
decision made by its supreme executive body, the Moscow party
bureau.
   Sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya, a leading proponent of
perestroika _ Gorbachev's program of economic and social
restructuring _ assailed conservatives for maneuvering to block the
election of reformers as conference delegates.
   ``The most pronounced advocates of perestroika were not
selected,'' she told a news conference.
   Zaslavskaya had failed to receive enough votes to stand as a
candidate for one of the 319 delegate spots to be filled from
Moscow. But the Moscow party bureau ordered her name to be put
before the Moscow party committee as a delegate candidate, Tass
said.
   Other prominent perestroika advocates whose names were restored
to the ballot included movie director Elem Klimov, economist
Nikolai Shmelev, playwright Mikhail Shatrov and Moscow News editor
Yegor Yakovlev.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of the weekly Ogonyok, said this week
that Friday's meeting might revise some delegate selections to
include reformers like himself taken off the slate in
pre-conference maneuvering.
   Tass said Friday night that Korotich was elected as a conference
delegate from the regional party committee in the Ukrainian Black
Sea port city of Kherson.
   Zaslavskaya, Korotich, economist Abel Aganbegyan, historian Yuri
Afanasyev and writer Fyodor Burlatsky were among popular reformers
voted in as party delegates from their place of work, but axed at
the next level, the equivalent of precincts.
   Dissident Andrei D. Sakharov told a news conference this week
that Gorbachev should be given time and trust to continue his
pioneering reforms.
   ``I'm very much concerned with the anti-democratic actions and
the role the district party committees are playing in the elections
to the 19th Party Conference,'' Sakharov said. ``This is a direct
attack on perestroika.''
   Tass quoted Moscow party boss Lev N. Zaikov as telling the
Friday meeting that the party leadership decided to put the
additional names on the ballot because Moscow party organizations
and work collectives wanted to choose only their own members as
delegates.
   Zaikov said party leaders in the capital wanted the delegation
``to represent the interests of the city as a whole.''
   Tass said Friday's meeting elected 319 ``champions of
perestroika'' to represent Moscow at the conference, but identified
only a small number _ Gorbachev; Zaikov; the No. 2 man in the
Kremlin, Yegor K. Ligachev, and four other members of the national
leadership.
   The delegate battle has been the talk of Moscow for days, as
state-run media and even street protests brought an internal party
battle over reform into the open.
   According to party sources, there will be roughly one delegate
for every 3,800 Communist Party members at the conference, the 19th
in party history but the first since 1941.

<HEAD>Aspin: U.S. Should Have Used Military Force To Oust Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should have used military
force to remove Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power in Panama
and missed its opportunity to ``go in there and snatch him,'' the
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said Friday.
   ``I think it may be too late to use force now because he's
moving around,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.
   ``You don't know where he is ... what we should have done at the
very beginning was use military force _ not blowing a lot of people
up, but to go in there and snatch him and take him out.''
   Aspin was interviewed on John McLaughlin's ``One on One''
syndicated television program, taped for showing this weekend.
   Aspin answered affirmatively when McLaughlin asked whether he
favored ``surgically'' removing Noriega, who has been indicted by
the United States on drug charges.
   ``You can't do it so easily now, because they're on their
guard,'' Aspin said. ``He's got guards, he's protected, he's moving
around. ... At least if you know where he is, it's a whole
different problem. And I think that's where we are now.''
   Aspin also said that the medium-range missile treaty on which
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev this week
exchanged ratification documents ``is a small step, but ... a small
step in the wrong direction.''
   The Wisconsin congressman says he opposes that treaty because
while it eliminates some nuclear weapon, it leaves an imbalance of
conventional arms.
   But he called the U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow a success because
Reagan called attention to human rights issues by talking to
dissidents and visiting monasteries.

<HEAD>With AM-Sakharov, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following are excerpts from Friday's news
conference by Andrei D. Sakharov as translated from Russian into
English by a Soviet Foreign Ministry official.
   _On reforms ordered by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev:
   The country has entered into the decisive stage of perestroika
(restructuring of Soviet economy and society). That's a very
complicated one and a very contradictory stage of perestroika and I
don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that this is a
dangerous stage in perestroika.
   Perestroika is an historical inevitability because there is no
other alternative to the phenomena of stagnation in this country,
the lagging behind in terms of scientific and technological
advances.
   The glasnost (increased openness in certain areas) effort is
very important, but I still have a lot of apprehensions. Important
laws that have been passed over the past 12 months or so which
pertain to the economy, such laws as those on the state enterprise
and cooperatives, individual labor activity, to my mind still have
the imprint of political compromise, lack of elaboration and haste.
   It seems to me the ice has been broken and there is no going
back to Stalinism any more. I think the opponents of perestroika
understand that too.
   _On the Moscow summit:
   The talks which ended between the Soviet and American leaders
were important in the view of promoting Soviet-American relations
and in ensuring a better atmosphere of trust and confidence.
   The main thing which is important to everyone is the prospect of
halving strategic nuclear weapons. I'm sure in talking about the
50-percent cuts an agreement is possible without any connection to
the SDI problem. (SDI, the Reagan administration's Strategic
Defense Initiative known as the Star Wars program, is a plan for a
space-based anti-missile defense system.)
   I subscribe to cutting the military service in the Soviet Union
in all the arms. I suggest that it be halved, corresponding to the
reduction in armaments, though probably the number of officers
should not be reduced that drastically. Of course that's a
responsible decision but that step would be very important for the
overall situation internationally and that would help promote
disarmament and detente.
   _On Afghanistan:
   Now on the Soviet troops withdrawal from Afghanistan. That's a
major historical development. I believe the Soviet troop withdrawal
should go on in any conditions, no matter the actions of the rebels
in Afghanistan.
   All the residents of Afghanistan should be given the right to
ask for political asylum in the Soviet Union and in other
countries, so that they can be sure they will survive.
   The introduction of Soviet troops in Afghanistan in 1979 was a
major mistake. One of the results of the democracy effort in the
Soviet Union should be a situation where such mistakes will be
impossible to make in the future.
   _On human rights:
   All the prisoners of conscience (in the Soviet Union) should be
set free without any declaration on their part. In 1987 when they
were requested to ask for pardon, it was not a legitimate action. I
think all those released should be rehabilitated, otherwise when
these people are considered having been given a pardon this
preserves the situation where they were allegedly tried on a
legitmate basis.
   Here is another legislative problem. This is the right to freely
choose the country of residence. This should not be reduced to the
family reunion issue. Full implementation of the right to choose
freely the place of residence, emigration, coming back, ensured by
legislative acts will have vast imporatnce for this society to
remain open.

   President Reagan returned home from his Moscow
summit to a campaign-style star-spangled welcome Friday, and said
his talks with Mikhail S. Gorbachev would prove ``good and
promising for the future.''
   ``Peace and freedom are what this trip was about and we saw some
real progress in several areas in Moscow,'' the president said
moments after stepping off Air Force One, his memorable 11,000-mile
journey at an end.
   He claimed progress on human rights, regional conflicts and
``tangible progress'' toward a new arms control treaty _ even
though his talks with Gorbachev produced no breakthrough on a new
pact.
   Reagan and his wife Nancy were greeted by Vice President George
Bush and his wife Barbara as they stepped off their plane onto a
red carpet.
   The scene at Andrews Air Force Base was as meticulously
orchestrated as any in Reagan's two terms in the White House _ a
receiving line of dignitaries, several thousand invited guests
waving small American flags and a Marine band playing ``Ruffles and
Flourishes'' and the national anthem.
   ``As far as Nancy and I are concerned, there's no place like
home,'' Reagan said, as the audience cheered.
   The president pronounced himself and his wife as ``weary
travelers,'' and he seemed to lose his place once while reading his
prepared remarks.
   He touched on many of the same themes he raised several hours
earlier in a speech in London.
   There, the president said his summit talks with Gorbachev may
have begun dismantling Cold War barriers, but he vowed America will
remain wary and strong as it seeks lasting changes in Soviet
policies.
   Assessing his first visit to the Kremlin before an applauding
audience of British admirers, Reagan said he found Gorbachev to be
``a serious man seeking serious reform,'' and believed the
superpowers may be entering ``a new era of history.''
   Although the Soviet leader had expressed disappointment over the
lack of major summit achievements, Reagan said in his London speech
Friday that there had been ``tangible progress'' toward treaty
agreement for a drastic reduction in stockpiles of strategic
nuclear weapons.
   ``Such a treaty ... is, I believe, now within our grasp,'' he
said.
   But a senior Reagan adviser, national security adviser Colin
Powell, seemed somewhat more cautious in speakling with reporters
during the long flight home from England.
   Powell said the U.S.-Soviet relationshiop is nowe ``solidly in
place'' but said there are major differences blocking the way to a
comprehensive arms control treaty. ``We have to take this slowly,''
he said. ``In the next six months, the next six years, if you don't
come home with a treaty that the experts, the Congress, don't see
as strong ... it'll never be ratified.''
   The president made no prediction of a treaty agreement in his
remarks in Washington, and did not mention the possibility of a
future summit with Gorbachev before his term ends next January.
   Reagan noted that he and Gorbachev exchanged ratification
documents in Moscow for the pact they agreed to last December and
ticked off several other accomplishments of his five days in Moscow.
   ``All of this was good and promising for the future,'' he said.
   ``The events of this week in Moscow were momentous, not
conclusive perhaps but momentous .... You know it's occurred to me
that time does have a way of sorting things out,'' he said.
   ``Much is happening in the Soviet Union,'' Reagan said. ``We
hope and pray that the signs of change continue there.''
   Bush, who spoke briefly, noted that Reagan had raised the touchy
issue of human rights in remarks in the Soviet Union, and said,
``What's wrong with telling the other guy how you feel? The fact
is, you made us proud.''
   That was as close as Bush got to touching on Reagan's
controversial comment made in Moscow that Soviet emigration
policies may be the result of bureaucratic bungling rather than
Kremlin policies.
   The Reagans' welcome home and Andrews was watched by 4,000
members of the Republican National Committee, congressional
families, White House staff members and their families and
political appointees. More than two-dozen 7th-graders from the
Drane Middle School in Corsicana, Texas, wearing blue-and-white and
red-and-white rugby shirts, waved small American flags.
   The first couple also got a cheer when they arrived at the White
House, where Mrs. Reagan picked up their dog Rex, and gave him a
hug and kisses. The president picked up a 3-year-old boy, Jeffrey
Ryan Duberstein, son of Kenneth Duberstein, the deputy White House
chief of staff.
   In his England speech, Reagan portrayed Gorbachev in warm
personal terms, yet served notice he will not be pressured into
abandoning his campaign of speaking out against human rights abuses
in the Soviet Union.
   ``In matters of state, unless the truth be spoken, it ceases to
exist,'' Reagan said in a speech in the medieval Guildhall in
central London attended by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Even on the human rights issue, the president seemed to
exonerate Gorbachev, who has allowed increased emigration by Soviet
Jews since he assumed power in 1985.
   Reagan said human rights abuses were ``a defect of the (Soviet)
system'' and have ``been going on for a number of years.''
   ``You can't place the blame on any individual,'' he said.
   In a seemingly mellow mood for a longtime anti-communist who
once described the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire,'' Reagan
offered Gorbachev encouragement in his reform policies of glasnost,
or openness in society, and the economic restructuring known as
perestroika.
   But he warned Western allies that any assessment of U.S.-Soviet
relations during an uncertain time of change must be tempered by
prudence and caution.
   ``Let us embrace honest change when it occurs,'' Reagan said,
``but let us also be wary, let us stay strong.''
   The president received sustained applause from the Royal
Institute of International Affairs and lavish praise from Mrs.
Thatcher, who predicted that the Moscow summit will ``influence the
course of history for years to come.''
   ``The summit has brought us closer to the more stable and
peaceful relations between East and West that we all want to see,''
she said. ``Indeed, I believe there is more hope between East and
West than ever before...''
   In a splendid show of British pomp, Reagan was escorted into the
wood-paneled Guildhall, the 1,000-year-old cradle of English civic
government, by ceremonial sword and mace bearers who had led him
through a corridor guarded by Lord Mayor Sir Greville Spratt's
personal guard of pikemen and musketeers.
   ``Quite possibly, we are beginning to take down the barriers of
the postwar era,'' Reagan said in his speech. ``Quite possibly we
are entering a new era in history, a time of lasting change in the
Soviet Union.
   ``We will have to see. But if so, it is because of the
steadfastness of the allies _ the democracies _ for more than 40
years, and especially in this decade.''
   The president said his dealings with the Soviets were based on
``a new postwar strategy'' of speaking out about fundamental
political and moral differences between the superpowers and
pursuing ``vigorous diplomatic engagement.''
   It is, he said, ``a policy that rejects both the inevitability
of war or the permanence of totalitarian rule; a policy based on
realism that seeks not just treaties for treaties' sake but the
recognition and resolution of fundamental differences with our
adversaries.''

<HEAD>Policeman Hostage: `I Could See the Bullet'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A policeman held hostage by two armed
ex-convicts for almost nine hours last month says that at times his
captors were so congenial he felt as if he were on a fishing trip
with friends.
   ``There was one problem,'' officer Larry G. Strayer said. ``They
had guns and they were pointed at my head.''
   At one point Strayer, convinced he was about to die, told his
captors to ``make it quick,'' he said in an interview published
Friday in The Oregonian. He also said he wondered whether he had
bought enough life insurance to provide for his wife, his
21-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son.
   But he also said his ``natural gift for gab'' and experience as
a prison guard helped him get along with his captors and buy time
until he was able to escape.
   Albert W. Reinhart, 42, and Michael R. Ager, 37, of Tacoma,
Wash., held Strayer at gunpoint after he went to their motel room
May 12 to look for a man sought for a supermarket robbery.
   Strayer, 43, finally escaped after the two men fell asleep and
he grabbed Reinhart's gun, fatally shot Reinhart and wounded Ager.
   Ager, who had said throughout the night that he would not go
back to prison, refused to give up even then. He later shot himself
and died after police fired tear gas into the room.
   The two men, both heroin addicts, told Strayer they had robbed
the store to get drug money.
   During the ordeal, Strayer, a former guard at San Quentin Prison
in California, forced himself to joke and talk with his captors.
   ``They thought like cons and acted like cons,'' he said.
``Because of my background, I've learned how to establish a rapport
with a convict. It's a knack I never lost. I've got a natural gift
for gab, and that's what I did that night while I figured out how
to escape.''
   ``They weren't verbally abusive, and they had not manhandled
me,'' he said. ``It was like three buddies had gone fishing
somewhere.''
   Strayer was taken hostage after he had handcuffed Reinhart as a
suspect in the robbery. Suddenly, Ager was pointing a gun at
Strayer's head about 7 feet away, and he ordered two other officers
at the scene to leave.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Strayer said. ``I was looking right
down the barrel of the gun. I mean, I could see the bullet in the
cylinder. I put my hands up slowly and said, `Don't shoot me.'''
   When the late-evening news came on, the captors learned that the
bureau's Special Emergency Response Team had surrounded the motel,
Strayer recalled.
   ``They come through that door and you're dead,'' Reinhart told
Strayer.
   He had another hair-raising moment after the captors first fell
asleep, about 3 a.m. Strayer was ready to bolt for the door when
the phone rang. It was a hostage negotiator, who told Reinhart the
drugs that the captors had demanded would not be delivered.
   ``I thought to myself, `Tough luck,''' Strayer recalled. ``It
dawned on me how asleep he had been.''
   Strayer finally got out about an hour later when the pair were
sleeping again.
   ``I'm a police officer! I shot them!'' he shouted as he left the
motel room. He was hustled into a police van across the street,
where he used a mobile phone to call his wife.
   ``I was crying; everyone in the van was crying,'' he said. ``I
told her I was out and OK. It was all over.''

<HEAD>More Strong Thunderstorms Over The South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms developed across parts of the South on Friday,
after a night of severe weather, and unseasonably chilly air kept
temperatures down in New England and along the upper East Coast.
   Severe thunderstorms lasted for almost 24 hours until around
dawn Friday, then built up again during the afternoon with storms
extending from central Texas across southeastern Texas to southern
Louisiana, and from western sections of the Carolinas across
northern Georgia to central Alabama.
   Hail stones as big as golf balls were reported during the
afternoon at Halletsville in south-central Texas, and a
thunderstorm produced large hail near Richburg in northern South
Carolina.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms also extended from western New
England across parts of New York, Pennsylvania and the mid Atlantic
states to northern North Carolina.
   Unseasonably cool weather continued in the Northeast, where snow
showers were reported atop Mount Washington, which stands over
6,000 feet high in the White Mountains of northern New Hampshire.
Scattered frost was forecast over sections of northern New England
early Saturday.
   Atlantic City, N.J., cooled to a record low of 43 degrees.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the mid 50s to near 60 over
the mid Atlantic states and as far south as central North Carolina.
   There was a sharp temperature contrast across the Carolinas. At
3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 61 degrees at Charlotte, N.C.,
to 93 at Columbia, S.C., a distance of less than 100 miles.
   By contrast, afternoon temperatures were close to 90 over
eastern Montana and the Dakotas.
   Elsewhere, a few showers occurred over parts of Minnesota and
over parts of Washington and Oregon.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 104 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
The low for the day was 29 degrees at Houlton, Maine.
   For Saturday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from southeastern Virginia across the Carolinas to northern Florida
and along the Gulf Coast to southern Texas. Scattered
thundershowers also were forecast over southern Florida. Widely
scattered thunderstorms were forecast from western Montana across
Idaho to eastern Oregon. Showers were forecast from Washington
across western Oregon to northern California.
   Highs in the 60s were predicted from eastern North Carolina to
New England and from the central Appalachians to most of Ohio, and
from northwestern Montana across the Pacific Northwest to northern
California; in the 90s in central Florida, along the Rio Grande of
Texas, and from the Dakotas and eastern Montana across sections of
Wyoming and Utah to the desert Southwest; around 105 in sections of
eastern Montana; near 112 in the hottest areas of the desert
Southwest; and in the 70s or 80s across much of the rest of the
nation.

<HEAD>Cotton Mill Workers Strike,</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSTAR, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 workers struck
Yugoslavia's largest cotton mill Friday to protest a government
austerity program that cuts wages, the state-run Tanjug news agency
reported.
   Also Friday, the official Slovenian Socialist Youth Union
strongly protested the arrest of leading activist and journalist
Janez Jansa and said widespread protests could follow.
   Jansa had reported alleged plans for a military coup in Slovenia
to quell dissent in that northern republic. An army prosecutor said
Friday that Janez was arrested Tuesday in Ljubljana on suspicion of
revealing a military secret.
   The strikers, mostly women, stopped work at the Djuro Salaj
cotton mill in Mostar, central Yugoslavia, after hearing that their
wages will be slashed by 14.2 percent this month.
   Tanjug later reported that about 1,000 strikers returned to work
after a meeting with management.
   The workers decided to send a protest letter to the government
``warning of grave consequences'' resulting from the wage cuts, the
news agency said.
   The remaining workers balked at having their salaries cut from
the present average of $130 a month and continued the strike, said
Tanjug.
   The average salary in Yugoslavia is $155 a month.
   The government last Saturday began a major austerity program
that included substantial price increases, wage cuts of up to 30
percent and a 23.9 percent devaluation of the dinar, the national
currency.
   The measures are designed to eventually curb communist
Yugoslavia's 170 percent inflation rate and help in repaying a $21
billion foreign debt by introducing a more market-oriented economy.

   Most of the Cabinet and thousands of cheering
supporters gave President Reagan a band-playing, flag-waving
welcome back from the summit Friday, and he told them, ``There's no
place like home.''
   Reagan and his wife Nancy arrived at Andrews Air Force Base from
the Moscow meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev and a stopover in London,
and were greeted by a cheering crowd that jammed into Hangar 3 at
the invitation of the White House.
   Their applause reached a peak as the president walked down the
ramp of Air Force One and was greeted by Vice President George Bush
and a majority of his Cabinet.
   More than 20 7th-graders from the Drane Middle School in
Corsicana, Texas, waved flags and held up signs, one of which
proclaimed, ``Another One for the Gipper.''
   The White House invited 4,000 members of the Republican National
Committee, congressional staff members, political appointees and
their families, and servicemen. All but a few seats in bleachers
that lined the hangar walls were filled.
   ``As some of you may have heard, Mr. Gorbachev and I have been
trading Russian proverbs this week,'' Reagan said at the beginning
of his arrival address.
   ``But, you know, flying back across the Atlantic today it was an
American saying that kept running through my mind. Believe me, as
far as Nancy and I are concerned: `There's no place like home.'''
   Gazing at the people, many of whom were dressed in red and white
or blue and white, Reagan declared, ``All this red, white and blue
scenery hits these two weary travelers right where we live.''
   Reagan said, ``We're a little tired,'' and he looked it.
   ``But we're exhilarated at what has happened, exhilarated too at
the thought of the future and what may lie ahead for the young
people of America and all the world.''
   The White House had hoped to hold the arrival gala outside, but
the threat of rain caused a switch in plans and the rally was held
in the hangar used in recent years for such occasions. It was in
the same spot in the early 1970s that President Nixon was greeted
by a crowd of well-wishers on his return from the first
presidential trip to China.
   Bush, whom Reagan has endorsed in this year's presidential
election, stood with Reagan on a raised podium and said, ``Welcome
home and well done.''
   He lauded Reagan for urging Gorbachev during the talks in Moscow
to improve human rights conditions in the Soviet Union, and the
vice president said, ``What's wrong with telling the other guy how
you feel.''
   Before Reagan's arrival, organizers of the event handed out
small American flags to the people in the audience and a 39-member
Air Force band played martial music to warm up the crowd.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets To Hold Annual Discussion of Sea Incidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States and Soviet Union will
conduct their annual review of procedures to avoid incidents on the
high seas during meetings in Moscow next week, the Pentagon said
Friday.
   The annual review and consultation session will take place
Sunday through Friday, the Pentagon said. It is being held in
Moscow this year under a normal rotating schedule.
   The annual review is called for by the Agreement on Prevention
of Incidents On and Over the High Seas, which was signed in Moscow
in 1972.
   ``The purpose of the agreement is to improve safety on and over
the high seas by review and discussion of all bilateral incidents
at sea between the parties by strict observance of the
International Rules of the Road and by use of special signals
between naval units of both countries,'' the Pentagon said.
   A defense official speaking only on condition of anonymity said
U.S. representatives expected to discuss several recent incidents
during the meeting, including one in the Black Sea in which two
Soviet ships deliberately bumped two American vessels in a bid to
force them to a new course.
   Also likely to be discussed is an incident that occurred over
the Pacific Ocean when an Air Force pilot in a surveillance plane
observing a Russian missile test was blinded temporarily by what
was believed to be a Soviet laser.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union says more of its U.N.
staff members will become permanent civil servants, which addresses
a problem the United States has cited in withholding dues payments.
   Soviet practice has been for its nationals on the U.N. staff to
serve five years or less. U.S. officials say that makes them
inclined to favor Soviet policy over an impartial U.N. agenda
because they will be returning to the Soviet civil service.
   A United Nations staff member said Friday that the international
organization will be broke by the end of September unless new funds
are obtained. President Reagan needs to certify that U.S.
objections have been met before $44 million not paid for 1987 can
be released for the U.N.
   The staff member, speaking on condition his name not be used,
said that another solution would be for the Soviets to pay the
second half of their annual assessment early. The Soviet Union
usually pays in October.
   Vladimir Petrovsky, a Soviet deputy foreign minister, told a
Moscow news conference ``the most competent and experience Soviet
members of the Secretariat will ... be able to serve on the basis
of permanent contracts.''
   An English translation of Petrovsky's remarks, delivered May 19,
was made available to The Associated Press at the United Nations on
Friday. The U.N. information office in Moscow sent the text to New
York.
   The United States has withheld $44 million of the $144 million
it allocated for dues in 1987 partly because it said Soviet U.N.
personnel should be independent international civil servants.
America's total assessment is 25 percent of the budget.
   On Friday, the U.N. staff member called Petrovsky's comment
``the $44 million paragraph'' in the news conference text, which
covered such other topics as U.S.-Soviet relations and the current
special General Assembly session on disarmament.
   An American official said privately the Petrovsky statement
appeared to remove the last substantial U.S. objection to paying.
   ``It removes a lot of doubts,'' agreed Sergei Komolov, press
attache for the Soviet delegation to the disarmament session.
   Komolov suggested the announcement in Moscow went unnoticed
because few foreign correspondents attended the briefing. ``The
main press center was being renovated for the summit and perhaps
many reporters were not familiar with the room where the news
conference was held,'' he said.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev met in Moscow this
week, their fourth summit.
   Both the U.S. official and the U.N. staff member said the other
two conditions for releasing the money are being satisfied _ a 15
percent cut in the Secretariat staff, and a greater voice in the
budget process for large contributors.
   Staff cuts are being implemented and last year a budget review
committee was created that must approve the budget by consensus.
The United States is a member of the committee, giving it an
effective veto of budget decisions.
   Congress imposed the three conditions last year as part of the
U.S. budget appropriation. Reagan is required to give Congress an
annual evaluation of progress toward the goals.

   The Democratic Party can regain the
presidency in November if its national platform stresses family
issues, the head of the party's platform committee said Friday.
   At a forum on issues affecting families, Democratic Gov. James
Blanchard of Michigan, temporary chairman of the 163-member
platform committee, said the party should capitalize on an issue he
says Republicans have neglected.
   ``We have a good record of family issues ... (while) the
Republicans have spent the last eight years trying to regulate our
bedrooms and tell us what prayers to pray,'' Blanchard said.
   Republicans, he said, have gutted programs affecting low-income
families, the young and the elderly, while Americans see a need for
such programs.
   However, Blanchard added, Democrats must convince voters such
initiatives are financially feasible.
   Friday's forum was the last of four held this week on issues the
committee felt were key to winning the election. Earlier regional
forums dealt with jobs and the economy, education and youth, and
foreign policy and defense.

   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter
resolved a dispute over policy toward NATO and formed a new
minority government Friday, ending a three-week crisis created by
inconclusive elections.
   He presented the 21-member Cabinet to Queen Margrethe II at
Amalienborg Palace. The coalition includes Schlueter's Conservative
Party, which has 35 seats in the 179-member Parliament; the
Liberals with 22 and the Social Liberals with 10.
   Schlueter called his coalition ``the best foundation in a
difficult situation for stability in domestic and foreign
affairs.'' Denmark has not had a majority government since 1971.
   The way was cleared for the coalition when the parties agreed on
a method of reminding Denmark's North Atlantic Treaty Organization
allies of its 31-year-old policy barring nuclear weapons, Danish
radio said.
   Schlueter had refused to carry out an April 14 resolution by
Parliament requiring the government to notify visiting warships of
the policy, and called the May 10 election as a referendum on the
issue.
   Schlueter would not say how he resolved the matter but told
reporters he would explain it Tuesday in a speech to Parliament.
   The radio said he chose the ``Norwegian model,'' under which
Denmark's non-nuclear status would be mentioned in diplomatic
contacts before a port call but notification would not be sent to
captains as ships entered the harbor.
   The United States and Britain, the two nuclear powers in the
alliance military command, had said notifying ships might
compromise the policy of not acknowledging the locations of nuclear
arms.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz
made an appeal Friday for Arabs and Israelis to stop their
``winner-take-all competition'' and negotiate within the framework
of an American peace plan for the Middle East.
   Shultz told reporters on a flight from London that he has seen
no progress as he launched his fourth Mideast shuttle this year.
``But that doesn't mean I should stop,'' he added.
   Upon arriving in the Egyptian capital Friday, Shultz released a
five-page statement saying the root of the Arab-Israeli conflict
``is the competition between two national movements for one land.''
   He said neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis seem able to
abandon ``prejudices, hatred and overblown dreams'' in favor of a
negotiated settlement.
   Shultz urged compromise, saying, ``Arabs and Israelis are not
engaged in a winner-take-all competition. A fair settlement is
possible.''
   Despite the impasse, room exists for Israelis and Palestinians
to live side-by-side in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, Shultz
said. He gave no support to creation of a Palestinian state, nor
did he set a deadline for the parties to respond to his renewed
appeal.
   On his last trip, two months ago, Shultz tried to persuade
Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians to accept the plan by mid-April
and join in a peace conference on May 1. All three parties
informally rejected the proposal without putting their views in
writing.
   ``We're going to keep working on this, and all of the parties
seem to keep wanting me to come,'' Shultz said. ``As soon as you
send out the word you might come, they say, `Welcome, come.' They
see it's important to keep trying to find a way to peace.''
   But when asked if attitudes have changed, Shultz said, ``I don't
have any particularly indications of movement anywhere, but that
doesn't mean I should stop. The situation is that the problems are
of great importance.''
   He met for an hour with Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid and
will see President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday.
   Shultz's five-day mission will take him to Egypt, Jordan, Israel
and Syria for talks on the U.S. peace plan and a bit of
sightseeing. He had gone to London with President Reagan after the
Moscow summit.
   Shultz said the Soviets seemed to have softened their stand on a
international Middle East peace conference by no longer insisting
that it be ``authoritative.''
   In his airborne news conference, Shultz said the Soviets now use
the word ``effective'' to describe the conference he is trying to
set up to deal first with Palestinian self-rule, then an overall
settlement.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has opposed peace talks that might
let the Soviets assist positions of their Arab allies. It was not
clear whether the slight change Shultz said he detected could
influence Shamir.
   Shultz is making Cairo his base for the talks and spending all
four nights in the Egyptian capital.
   He scheduled only a three-hour visit to Jordan on Saturday and a
trip to Israel on Sunday.
   Shultz will meet with King Hussein in Amman, and with Shamir,
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
in Jerusalem.
   In Egypt, Shultz also planned to visit the ancient tombs in
Luxor.
   Rabin told a group of pro-Jordanian Palestinians from the West
Bank on Monday night that the Shultz visit has come too late, The
Financial Times reported.
   The London daily quoted one participant as saying Rabin told the
group that a serious initiative could not resume before next June,
after the new governments to be elected this year in Israel and the
United States have settled in.
   Hussein is withholding support for the plan unless he is
guaranteed Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank, which Jordan
held from 1948 until 1967.
   Hussein also has declined to speak for the Palestinian Arabs,
1.5 million of whom live on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.
Israel captured the areas in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The Israeli army put 190,000 Palestinians under restrictions
Friday to prevent violence on the opening day of a three-day strike
called to protest Shultz's visit.

   A Cypriot freighter was reported to have
been freed by Iran on Friday and allowed to continue its voyage the
day after it was boarded and seized, apparently on suspicion of
carrying war-related cargo.
   The 10,000-ton motor vessel Vevey left the Iranian port Bandar
Abbas at midday and was ``proceeding normally'' to its destinations
in the Persian Gulf, according to the Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence
Unit in London.
   The brief report, which Lloyd's said was provided by the
shipowners, gave no details.
   An Iranian frigate tentatively identified by U.S. naval
officials as the 1,540-ton Alborz intercepted the Vevey on Thursday
as it entered the gulf, bound for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait with a
listed cargo of Italian marble chips and powder.
   Iranian naval personnel boarded the ship and forced it o
accompany the frigate to Bandar Abbas, site of a major Iranian
naval base, Lloyd's said.
   Iran frequently stops commercial vessels in the southern gulf to
search them for contraband or military-related cargo bound for
Iraq. It also sometimes takes the ships into custody for further
investigation.
   Such boardings are legal under international maritime law in
wartime circumstances, such as the gulf, where Iraq and Iran have
been at war for almost eight years.
   In seizing the Vevey, Iran appeared to risk a confrontation with
the U.S. Navy missile cruiser Vincennes, which was on patrol two
miles away.
   U.S. officers said the cruiser could have intervened if the
Vevey's captain decided he was being attacked and radioed for help.
   The officers would not speculate whether the Iranians were
purposely trying to defy the Vincennes, a high-tech Aegis-type
cruiser on its first patrol after arriving in the gulf last weekend.
   Under expanded rules of engagement that became effective a month
ago, U.S. warships can intervene in attacks on non-U.S. flag ships
provided the ships ask for help and are in international waters,
outside the ``war exclusion zones'' declared by Iran and Iraq.
   Iranian gunboats have conducted four raids on neutral shipping
since the new policy took effect, but in areas where patrolling
U.S. warships were too far away to have intervened if asked.
   The Belgian government announced Friday in Brussels it was
recalling one of its two warships in the gulf, the mine sweeper
command-support vessel Zinnia. That will dissolve a Belgian-Dutch
unit formed in September.
   Belgium and the Netherlands each sent three mine-sweeping craft
to the gulf as part of a multinational effort to clear the waterway
of mines laid by Iran.

   Pope John Paul II on Friday began a
five-day tour of Emilia-Romagna, Italy's ``Red Region'' that has
been led by communist governments or leftist coalitions since 1946.
   In an address to residents at his first stop in the industrial
town of Carpi, the pontiff denouced ``the fall of moral values.''
   He also decried what he called a crisis in the basic aspects of
life such as ``the stability of the family ... a generous and
responsible fatherhood and motherhood ... and the respect of human
life at any stage.''
   He called for a return to ``ancient Christian traditions'' and
for giving up materialism and hedonism.
   The provincial capitals of Modena, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia,
Parma and Bologna in north-central Italy are on the pope's agenda.
They have the highest per-capita income in the nation.
   But they are also have increasing drug problems and the lowest
birth rates in Italy and are among the cities with the highest
number of abortions and suicides, according to recent regional
statistics.
   John Paul flew by helicopter to Carpi from the airport at
Bologna and later traveled to Modena, where he was welcomed by
communist Mayor Alfonsina Rinaldi.
   The 40-year-old mayor, in her address to the pope, said ``women
of Modena are increasingly feeling the need of a new sensibility,
to harmonize progress and respect of life.''
   During his 73rd trip to Italian districts outside of Rome, the
Polish-born pontiff will visit the headquarters of the famed
Ferrari car-racing team at Fiorano.
   He is scheduled to meet company workers and formula-one race
drivers Michele Alboreto and Gerhard Berger and have a private
meeting with the company chief, Enzo Ferrari, and his family.
   Company sources said the pope may unveil a new F-1 racer that
could make its debut in the formula-one world championship
competition in July.
   Ferrari, Italy's car-racing pioneer, celebrated his 90th
birthday in January.
   He has been known as an agnostic and made no secret of his
dislike of the Vatican, which had criticized the company because of
the deaths of some Ferrari drivers in racing accidents.
   ``It's an old and forgotten controversy,'' a Ferrari spokesman
said.

<HEAD>Confusion Over Look-alikes Sends Wrong Brother To Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterinarian spent 26 days in jail before
convincing drug authorities that he isn't his brother, who has been
indicted on cocaine smuggling charges.
   Rafael Roca-Suarez gained his freedom at a hearing Thursday
before U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff.
   ``An honest mistake,'' Turnoff called it.
   He ordered Roca-Suarez's release on a $100,000 personal surety
bond and gave prosecutors and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
agents three weeks to make a few final checks on the situation.
   Roca-Suarez's wife, Patricia, said it was at least the second
time her husband has suffered from mistaken identity with his
look-alike brother, Renato. She said her husband was detained in
Panama in 1983 until a DEA agent was flown in to say he was the
wrong man.
   The same DEA agent, Rich Vandiver, had to be flown to Miami from
South America for the hearing Thursday.
   Renato Roca-Suarez, a pilot, is charged in a 1980 federal
indictment with conspiracy to import 854 pounds of cocaine from
Bolivia to the United States.
   Rafael Roca-Suarez was arrested last month in Houston. At a May
9 court hearing there, the 40-year-old Rafael testified that his
brother, Renato, who is a year and a half younger, is the man
authorities were seeking. But DEA agent David Gorman misidentified
Rafael as Renato, and Rafael was sent to Miami to face trial.
   The case was going forward based on a belief that Rafael was
Renato _ but defense attorneys met privately with Mark Schnapp,
chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Miami, to show him military records, photos of the two brothers
together and newspaper articles about Renato, who, they said was
still in Bolivia. Schnapp said he questioned Rafael outside court
and was satisfied that he had veterinary training.
   By then, Schnapp said, he was convinced that the U.S. government
had to re-examine the question of identity.

<TEXT>
   A military court indicted Fernando
Paulsen, editor in chief of the opposition weekly news magazine
Analisis, and one of its reporters Friday on charges of slandering
the navy.
   Prosecutor Miguel Munoz, a navy captain, indicted Paulsen and
Ivan Badilla, the reporter who wrote the article in question, which
dealt with the navy's purchase of eight French-made helicopters and
suggested it overpaid.
   Both were arrested Tuesday in this port city 80 miles northwest
of Santiago, the capital. If found guilty, they could receive
prison sentences of up to 10 years.
   Juan Pablo Cardenas, publisher of the magazine, was detained for
five days last week but released without charges. A navy statement
said he still was under investigation.
   The Analisis article said the cost of the helicopters should
have been $36 million but the navy paid $217 million.
   It said there were unconfirmed reports that two reconaissance
aircraft were included in the deal, and some of the money may have
been spent on support gear, but that would not account for a
difference of $181 million.

<HEAD>Farmworkers Union Says Growers Manipulate Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. CRUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WOODBURN, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Oregon farmers are passing out false
documents to help illegal aliens get around the new immigration law
in an effort to retain a supply of cheap labor, leaders of a
farmworkers union alleged Friday.
   The victims are an estimated 20,000 destitute migrant workers
who have flooded Oregon this spring, said Cipriano Ferrel and Larry
Kleinman of Northwest Treeplanters and Farmworkers United.
   Word had spread among pickers that many farmers in the state
would prepare fraudulent documents for workers who want to qualify
for legal standing under the 1986 Immigration Reform Act, the union
activists said at a news conference here.
   They said farmers in the Willamette Valley are doing everything
they can to keep workers unorganized. The result is an
overabundance of labor for the strawberry harvest, which begins in
a few days.
   ``We see this as a concerted effort by the growers,'' Kleinman
said. ``It's rampant.''
   Under the 1986 act, aliens who want to be employed as migrant
farm workers must prove they worked 90 days in the fields between
May 1, 1985, and April 30, 1986.
   Kleinman said the union had a list of 30 valley growers
suspected of issuing fraudulent documentation, including one farm
that claimed that each worker put in exactly the same number of
days on the harvest. He declined to name the farms.
   Matthew Unger, chairman of the Oregon Strawberry Commission, a
growers group, said he hadn't heard of any grower filling out
documents fraudulently.
   ``I don't think anyone is trying to flood the market with them
...,'' he said of the migrant workers. ``We don't want to pay a
high price for picking, but we're not trying to drive it down
either.''
   Other farmers, however, have said they have heard of growers who
charge high fees to prepare false immigration papers. Strawberry
farmer Doug Krahmer of Cornelius said he has heard of growers
charging as much as $400.
   The migrant workers, many of whom are from Mexico and Central
America, are eligible to return to the United States in future
years to harvest crops once they qualify as ``special agricultural
workers'' under the immigration law.
   Upon questioning the workers, it becomes apparent that many no
idea what the forms say, Kleinman said.
   ``If you ask the workers what they did and when, some workers
will say, `I picked cucumbers in November and I picked strawberries
in April,''' Kleinman said. ``Now we know that's not possible,''
since the crops weren't harvested during those months.
   Kleinman said immigration officials were ``turning their backs''
on the problem, but Immigration and Naturalization Service District
Director David Beebe disagreed.
   He said that 25 percent to 50 percent of the applicants coming
to the Portland office are suspected of carrying fraudulent
documents. The agency is investigating the situation but doesn't
want to disclose details of its efforts, he said Friday.
   Ferrel said that in the past two weeks, 80 percent of the
migrants coming to the union offices for assistance have carried
fraudulent documents given to them by growers or their agents, such
as labor contractors.
   As a result, the union has stopped helping workers apply for
legalization, Ferrel said, although it still will refer people to
other organizations for assistance.
   The crush of migrants in the region is testing the limits of
relief agencies in much of northwestern Oregon.
   Ferrel likened the situation to slavery and Kleinman added, ``If
this isn't like South Africa, I don't know what is.

   Major employers sought court
orders Friday in an effort to block a three-day protest called for
next week by black trade unions that is expected to become a
general strike.
   In other developments Friday, a white anti-apartheid activist
disputed the government's contention that no youngsters under the
age of 16 are being detained without charge under emergency-rule
decrees.
   And the government announced it would seek authority from the
Supreme Court to evict 1,800 people from a township where blacks
have lived for 40 years.
   Unions are barred by law from advocating strikes not related to
contract disputes. South Africa's two largest black labor
federations left it up to their affiliates to decide how to respond
to a call for a protest to begin Monday.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions and the National
Council of Trade Unions, representing an estimated of 1.4 million
black workers, joined forces to protest a new labor bill they say
would cripple their unions by curtailing their ability to strike.
   ``Employers are not prepared to put effective pressure (on the
government) unless their interests are directly affected,''
congress general secretary Jay Naidoo told a news conference. ``We
believe if our members do take protest action some of that action
will affect their (the employers') interests.''
   Demonstrations are also planned over the next two weeks against
the 2-year-old state of emergency decreed on June 12 and the June
16 anniversary of the 1976 riots in the black township of Soweto.
   In their legal action the employers asked the courts for
injunctions against union officials participating in any unlawful
strike or job action.
   Max Coleman of the Detainees Parents Support Committee
challenged the claim last week by Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok that no children younger than 16 were being held under
state-of-emergency regulations.
   Coleman released a statement listing the names of six black
detainees he said were 15 years old. He said others were under 16
when they were picked up and turned 16 in detention.
   Vlok said Coleman's statement ``reveals the shocking and chaotic
condition of the information that he has at his disposal and which
he and other radical persons use to vilify South Africa.''
   In his statement, Coleman said some children had been held for
more than a year without being charged.
   He said about 2,500 people are in detention under emergency
regulations, including about 250 youths under 18.
   Coleman's committee is one of 17 anti-apartheid organizations
banned in February from ``any activity whatsoever.''
   The government went to court to enforce its planned eviction of
1,800 people from the black township of Lawaaikamp near the white
city of George, east of Cape Town. It said the move does not
contradict its declaration that the policy of forced removals for
racial separation ended in 1984.
   Carel du Plessis, the George town clerk, said Friday the
evictions will be carried out under a law giving the municipality
authority over use of its land.
   Lawaaikamp residents at a meeting Thursday claimed the
government was reversing its policy because they would be forced to
move to make way for the development of a township for people of
mixed-race.
   Du Plessis said the residents would be given notices beginning
June 7 telling them of the city's plans to seek Supreme Court
approval for eviction orders.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Simon Says He Hopes To Retain Influence Over Delegates To
Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon said Friday he hopes to
retain some influence over his eroding base of delegates to the
Democratic National Convention but acknowledged he cannot control
the delegates.
   The Illinois senator, who put his presidential campaign on hold
nearly two months ago, still has some 150 delegates but has lost
more than 30 in the last three weeks, most of whom have defected to
Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   ``I'm pleased that the huge majority of them are holding off
doing anything,'' he said. ``I think we want to do what we can to
stick together and be a force for good at the convention.''
   ``I don't think anyone controls delegates ... but I think you
can have some influence.''
   Simon, speaking at a news conference, said he plans to meet with
Dukakis after Tuesday's final four primaries to discuss topics
including the selection of a vice presidential candidate.
   He all but ruled out accepting the vice presidential nomination
himself, saying he would consider it only ``if some specific
responsibilities were spelled out.''
   ``I'm frankly not interested in spending four years cutting
ribbons and attending state funerals,'' Simon said.
   He declined to speculate on Jesse Jackson's potential as a vice
presidential candidate but listed three U.S. senators he said
Dukakis might consider.
   ``If Mike Dukakis goes the traditional route and ... recognizes
that the principal contribution a vice president may make is in
bringing in one state, then the two obvious choices I think are
John Glenn in Ohio and Lloyd Bentsen in Texas,'' Simon said.
   He said he doesn't see a similar vice presidential prospect in
California, but went on to praise Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers, who
for a time was Simon's choice for president.
   ``If you look at the number of electoral votes in the state of
Arkansas, he isn't a logical candidate, but I think there are other
reasons he should be considered,'' Simon said.

<HEAD>Eds.: Leads with 7 grafs to tighten lead and UPDATE with

<TEXT>
   An unreleased Clark County Fire
Department report cites more than a dozen violations in storing a
volatile rocket fuel oxidizer at a Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp. plant.
   The report, obtained by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, cites
violations in the storage of ammonium perchlorate and imprudent
handling of flammable, toxic chemicals and gases used in its
production.
   ``It is this department's opinion that many of the chemicals,
including ammonium perchlorate, stored and-or handled at the
Kerr-McGee facility, are not being stored and-or handled in
compliance with nationally recognized standards,'' said the report,
quoted Friday by the newspaper.
   Kerr-McGee spokeswoman Anita Bridges said the company had hired
a fire safety consultant, Robert Van Dolah of Pittsburgh, after
receiving the report Tuesday. Van Dolah arrived in Henderson
Thursday night and met with fire officials Friday to address their
concerns, Ms. Bridges said.
   ``The company is saying that if there are problems with safety
at the plant, we're going to fix them,'' Ms. Bridges said Friday
afternoon. ``We're going to make sure that plant's operating
safely.''
   A high-ranking fire department source told the newspaper the
department will lobby against renewed production of ammonium
perchlorate until Kerr-McGee reduces safety risks.
   The Kerr-McGee plant in Henderson halted production of ammonium
perchlorate May 12 following an explosion a week earlier at nearby
Pacific Engineering and Production Co. Kerr-McGee and PEPCON were
the only plants in the country producing the oxidizer used in the
space shuttle and military rockets.
   Meanwhile, Nevada Sen. Harry Reid said ``the handwriting is on
the wall'' and plants that produce hazardous materials may have to
move out of the Henderson industrial complex.
   Reid said consideration must be given to relocating such plants
in the aftermath of the PEPCON explosion.
   Reid made his comments in addressing 100 residents of the Green
Valley subdivision Thursday night. Green Valley was one of the
areas hardest hit by the explosion that killed two people, injured
326 and caused $73 million in property damage.
   The senator first said he was sure the Kerr-McGee plant would
remain in Henderson if it is found to be safe. But he later said
concerns by local residents and government officials might force
the relocation of plants such as Kerr-McGee and others that make
combustible materials.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Guarantee of Legal Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No death-row inmate should be left to face
execution without a lawyer, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a December 1987
ruling by own of its own three-judge panels that denied such access
to the appeals process to inmates.
   In Virginia, unlike most other states, inmates who cannot afford
an attorney and have no volunteer counsel have no guarantee of
legal assistance once their sentences have been affirmed by the
state Supreme Court.
   Jonathan Sasser, a Durham, N.C., attorney, said Friday's 6-4
opinion apparently is the first time the right to counsel after
sentencing has been upheld by a federal appeals court.
   ``It's an access to the courts issue,'' said Sasser, who is
among the lawyers representing as a class all indigent Virginia
death-row inmates who are without personal volunteer attorneys.
``For a death-row inmate in Virginia, it means you have to have a
living, breathing attorney to represent you.''
   Gerald Zerkin, a Richmond attorney involved in the case, said
the ruling ``resolves a very difficult situation in which men on
death row did not have access to counsel to challenge their death
sentences.''
   The state will now be required to provide representation for
those men, Zerkin said, although the specifics of the system have
not been worked out.
   Sasser, who had been told about the decision but had not read
it, said the ruling stems from the case of Earl Washington, who was
condemned to die in August 1985. Washington could not afford to
hire a lawyer and no volunteers could be found to handle his case.
   ``He was sitting there waiting to be executed and he couldn't do
anything about it, because he didn't have an attorney,'' Sasser
said. ``The importance of this case is that that won't happen
again, unless the Supreme Court reverses it.''
   A lawyer was retained about a week before Washington's execution
date and he won a stay. Washington's appeals continue.
   Joseph Giarratano, another Virginia death-row inmate who had
legal counsel, was disturbed by the Washington case and contested
the lack of guaranteed counsel to a federal court in 1986.
   U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. agreed that such
representation is constitutionally warranted, but that decision was
overturned last year by the 4th Circuit panel.
   The latest decision is binding in the 4th Circuit, comprising
Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West
Virginia.
   Zerkin said the ruling also will serve as a precedent for cases
in other states, but said ``many, I would say most, states already
provide representation without having been required to do so.''

   Four grown children of American servicemen
missing in Southeast Asia went to the White House on Friday to seek
an explanation for President Reagan's willingness to help recover
Soviet soldiers missing from Afghanistan.
   Elizabeth Stewart, Washington representative of the American
League of Families of Prisoners of War in Laos, said it was an
``outrage'' that Reagan was willing to help the Soviets when he has
ignored her group's pleas for help. The group sought a meeting with
Reagan or a representative of the president.
   Ms. Stewart is the daughter of Air Force Col. Peter J. Stewart,
shot down over Dien Bien Phu, Laos, on March 15, 1966. She spoke by
telephone with White House spokesman B.J. Cooper, who declined to
meet with the group but promised a response would be forthcoming.
   ``I indicated I was appalled that the president was willing to
help'' recover missing Soviet troops, Ms. Stewart said.
   Before Reagan's trip to Moscow, her group wrote to Reagan and
requested that he ask Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to use his
influence with Vietnam to help return missing Americans.
   At Moscow University, Reagan was asked by a student if he would
be willing to help recover more than 300 missing Soviet soldiers in
Afghanistan. ``Very much so,'' the president replied.
   The Pentagon lists 2,404 Americans unaccounted for from the
Vietnam War.
   Cooper said, ``A lot of efforts are made on a daily basis.
Sometimes they're not as visible (as a presidential promise in
Moscow). ... You're not always in a position to make all your
information public.''
   Cooper said Ms. Stewart's requested meeting with White House
officials would have to wait because experts on the subject had
gone for the day and the staff had to track down her pre-summit
letter.
   Ms. Stewart was accompanied by Michael Clark of Santa Barbara,
Calif., Gary Wright of McLean, Va. and Sherill Standerwick Long of
Germantown, Md.

<HEAD>Three Former Prisoners Allowed to Leave for U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three former prisoners, including a man
accused of taking part in a plot to kill President Fidel Castro,
were allowed Friday to leave Cuba for the United States, the Cuban
government news agency reported.
   Prensa Latina, in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City, said
Ramon Guin Diaz, one of the three political prisoners, was
sentenced in 1966 to a 25-year prison term for ``complicity and
participation in the attempt'' on Castro's life.
   It said Guin Diaz used his high post in the Institute of
Agrarian Reform to work as a CIA agent for three years.
   ``Guin, who was 32 at that time (1966), confessed his guilt and
admitted to having worked for the CIA since September of 1963,''
Prensa Latina said.
   His main job was to relay political, military and economic
information, according to the agency.
   It said Guin Diaz was released from prison ``some time ago.''
   Prensa Latina did not identify the other former
``counter-revolutionary'' prisoners or say how they would travel to
the United States.
   The United States and Cuba signed an immigration agreement in
late 1984 that was suspended by Castro after Radio Marti, the U.S.
station, began broadcasts directed toward the island nation.
   That pact was revived eight months ago when Cuba agreed to take
back about 2,500 migrants from the 1980 Mariel boatlift. The United
States then opened its doors to 3,000 political prisoners and the
annual flow of 20,000 immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.

<HEAD>Deaf-Mute Boy Found in Mexico Might Be American Crash Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old boy found wandering in a
Mexican border city possibly survived a plane crash and might be
from the United States, officials said.
   The boy, who doesn't hear or speak and communicates only by
gesturing and drawing pictures, was found Nov. 7 by the side of a
highway in Ciudad Juarez. No one knows his name, but Juarez welfare
workers have named him ``Savat.''
   Authorities believe Savat is from the United States because of
his reactions to American cultural icons _ including hamburgers and
video games _ and they believe he lived through a plane crash
because of his drawings.
   ``He drew a plane, then he drew a plane that had crashed,'' said
Luis Torre of the Texas Department of Human Services. Torre works
as liaison between El Paso and Juarez child welfare agencies.
   Torre said Thursday that the second drawing depicted a lot of
blood and the bodies of two adults and a child.
   `We believe those represent his parents and a sister. He showed
me by using his fingers that he crawled away from the wreckage,''
said Torre.
   He said the boy has scars on his chest and back that look to be
2 to 3 years old.
   According to a report Torre filed with El Paso police, the boy's
pictures seem to indicate he was picked up after a plane crash by a
passer-by and taken to a hospital. After treatment, the boy
apparently left to look for his family.
   Authorities are stumped as to when or where the plane might have
crashed or how Savat got to Juarez, across the border from El Paso.
   The woman who found the boy, Guadalupe de la Vega of Juarez,
said she thinks Savat might be from the United States because he
doesn't like chili, tortillas or beans, but readily eats hamburgers
and hot dogs.
   He also is good at playing video games, which most young Mexican
children lack the money to play.
   ``We just recently got him into a school for the deaf,'' Torre
said. ``They showed him cartoons of American characters such as
Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse, and of Mexican characters, and he was
more familiar with the American cartoons and seemed to like them
better.''
   He added that Savat seems more familiar with U.S. money.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In response to the state's worsening tax
shortfall, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' top administrative aide imposed
a cap on the size of the state work force Friday and ordered agency
heads to plan for cuts in staffing.
   Administration and Finance Secretary Frank Keefe said the policy
is not a hiring freeze because agency heads will be allowed to fill
positions emptied through attrition as long as they stay within the
totals authorized as of next Monday.
   In a memorandum to cabinet secretaries, Keefe said ``agencies
must take action immediately to assure that they will be able to
reach staffing levels that can be supported'' by the budget being
drafted by the Legislature.
   ``What we would envision is no layoffs, no disruption,'' Keefe
said, adding that reductions will be accomplished by not filling
jobs that become empty.
   According to Keefe, Dukakis personally endorsed the plan earlier
this week after it was discussed at several cabinet meetings. He
also said Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy participated in those discussions.
She would become governor if Dukakis, who is running for the
Democratic nomination for president, is elected.
   Keefe told reporters that the number of jobs he projects will be
lost through attrition would be in ``the low thousands'' across an
executive branch workforce of about 66,500.
   In addition, Keefe said certain key agencies _ including the
departments of Correction, Mental Health and Revenue _ will be
allowed some expansion to meet the priority goals of the governor
and the Legislature. As a result, he said, some agencies may face
relatively harsher cutbacks in order to keep the overall state work
force at an affordable level.
   The Budget Bureau will monitor personnel rates weekly. Keefe
said the situation is ``fluid'' and will be reviewed quarterly. If
revenues improve, hiring could be expanded, he said.
   The personnel directive is part of the Dukakis administration's
strategy for dealing with a slowdown in state tax collections that
has put the spotlight on Dukakis' ability to manage government
spending, which is one of the prime credentials he has claimed in
his campaign for the presidential nomination.
   As recently as Wednesday, the official projection of tax
collections was revised downward by more than $300 million for the
current fiscal year, which ends June 30.
   For next year, the administration's latest revisions in revenues
anticipate at least $200 million less than when Dukakis submitted
his original $11.9 billion budget plan in January.

<HEAD>Waldheim Says Pope Visit Will Help Austria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim, shunned by world
leaders because of questions about his actions in World War II,
said the visit to Austria by Pope John Paul II will help the
country's image, a magazine reported Friday.
   ``The pope's visit will have a positive effect,'' Kathpress, a
Roman Catholic news agency, quoted Waldheim as saying in an
interview with the Italian Catholic monthly Trenta Giorni. John
Paul is to be in Austria June 23-27.
   Waldheim also was quoted as saying he regretted the protests
that followed his audience with the pontiff last year in the
Vatican. ``It was a shame that the pope was dragged into such a
slanderous campaign,'' he said.
   Excerpts of Waldheim's remarks were distributed in German by
Kathpress and translated by The Associated Press.
   The president said he did not believe John Paul's June visit to
Austria and their meeting would cause widespead protests, ``at
least not like those the last time.''
   The Vatican said that last year's audience was granted to the
presidential office, not to Waldheim as an individual.
   John Paul first visited Austria in 1983, three years before
Waldheim was elected president.
   Waldheim has denied allegations that he was involved in Nazi war
crimes while serving as a German army lieutenant in the Balkans
during World War II.
   An international commission of historians appointed by the
Austrian government at the president's request concluded in
February that Waldheim was aware of Nazi atrocities in the region
and did nothing to prevent them, but it left the question of guilt
open.
   Waldheim has not visited or received any Western heads of state
since his election in 1986.

   North Korea changed ministers and commission
chairmen in six posts related to the economy, the official Korea
Central News Agency reported Friday.
   It was the fifth shuffle in three years involving top economic
positions.
   The North Korean news agency, in a broadcast monitored in Tokyo,
said President Kim Il Sung issued a decree Thursday involving
members of the Administration Council, which is similar to a
Cabinet and is headed by the premier.
   There are about 40 ministries and commissions in the council
with half related to economic planning, industries, mining,
transportation, construction, transportation and agriculture.
   Japanese analysts, including Katsumi Sato of the private Korean
Affairs Research Center, have said they believed the frequent
council changes indicated the communist government was struggling
to remove economic bottlenecks.
   Kim Young-sam, a major South Korean opposition leader, has
proposed that South Korea help North Korea pay its overdue foreign
debts, estimated at $4 billion.
   He told a news conference in Seoul Tuesday the North Koreans'
``international economic standing is so low they cannot pay back
the debt. We could help them by importing primary or parts of
secondary products from them.''
   North Korea broke off talks with South Korea on economic,
humanitarian and parliamentarian exchanges early in 1986 to protest
the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises.

   Students and police clashed Friday in the
fifth straight day of campus protests that officials claim were
fomented by the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla organization.
   The Shining Path has been battling for eight years to topple the
elected government and the fighting has taken at least 10,000 lives.
   Students began blocking roads with burning tires and debris and
hurling rocks at police at San Marcos University and two other Lima
universities early this week to protest higher school fees and an
alleged massacre of highland peasants by soldiers.
   Police responded by firing tear gas and at one point went
through San Marcos University and arrested about 100 people, many
wearing masks and shouting Shining Path slogans, according to
police and reporters.
   Protests intensified Wednesday after a demonstrator was killed
in a shooting that is still being investigated. Students told
juournalists more than a dozen protesters have been wounded by
buckshot fired by police.
   No reports were available of any casualties or arrests from
Friday's campus violence.
   Officials said Friday that two Shining Path gunmen killed a
policeman as he guarded a courthouse Thursday in Chimbote, a
coastal state capital 255 miles north of Lima.
   The government said Friday that five more gunmen were killed in
jungle gunfights in a cocaine-trafficking region on Wednesday that
had previously been reported, bringing the number of
``narco-terrorists'' killed that day to 16 .
   Officials earlier had reported police killed 11 Maoist
guerrillas on Wednesday near Uchiza. They said Friday that five
drug traffickers were killed in a nearby clash later in the day.
   The government says the Shining Path provides protection to drug
runners in Peru's eastern jungles and officials use the term
``narco-terrorists'' to describe both groups.

<HEAD>More Testimony About Meese at Wedtech Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former president of the Wedtech Corp.
testified Friday that Attorney General Edwin Meese III asked him
about a multimillion dollar Navy contract that Meese has denied
helping the defense contractor obtain.
   Anthony Guariglia, the former Wedtech president, testified at
the racketeering trial of U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi that Meese asked
about the Navy pontoon contract at a 1985 ball in Washington.
   Guariglia and other company officials have testified they paid
$800,000 to attorney E. Robert Wallach to influence the attorney
general.
   They have said Wallach, a close friend and former lawyer of
Meese's, told them he got Meese to intercede on the company's
behalf for a series of contracts worth $143 million to build
pontoons or floating, portable docks.
   Guariglia was the first witness to testify about anything Meese
allegedly said about the contract.
   Guariglia told jurors at the 13-week-old trial at federal court
in Manhattan that Wallach introduced him, Wedtech founder John
Mariotta and other officials of the Bronx-based company to Meese
and his wife at an ambassador's ball in Washington.
   ``Mr. Wallach said to Mr. Meese, what a fine job we were doing
in the South Bronx, that the company was growing and employment was
growing,'' said Guariglia. ``Mr. Meese asked how we were doing with
the pontoon contract. Mr. Mariotta said fine. Mr. Meese asked if we
were on time with our deliveries, and I believe Mr. Mariotta said
fine, and that was the end of the meeting.''
   Meese, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, has
previously denied any involvement in the pontoon contract. He has
admitted intervening with the Army on behalf of Wedtech's attempts
to win an engine contract in 1982, while he was presidential
counselor.
   Meese attorney Nathan Lewin said because the attorney general
was in Germany ``I can't give any direct comment on whether he
recalls or doesn't recall making that statement.''
   Lewin, reached at his Washington office, added, ``If that
statement was made by him (Meese) it is consistent with his
statements concerning his limited involvement or knowledge of
Wedtech matters.''
   Meese was not involved in obtaining the contract for Wedtech,
said Lewin, adding that Meese ``has acknowledged that he had been
told by Wallach that Wedtech had obtained a pontoon contract.''
   Wallach is under indictment on federal racketeering charges for
allegedly taking payoffs from Wedtech officials to influence Meese
and other public officials.
   Biaggi, Mariotta and five others are accused in the ongoing
trial of turning Wedtech, which is now in bankruptcy, into a
racketeering enterprise for the payment of bribes to obtain no-bid
government contracts.
   Guariglia is the last of four former Wedtech officials who have
pleaded guilty to corruption charges to testify at the Biaggi trial
in exchange for leniency.

   A judge on Friday rejected a defense
request for a mistrial on grounds that a prosecution witness'
testimony was unfair in former Gov. Evan Mecham's trial on charges
he concealed a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Judge Michael Ryan of Maricopa County Superior Court rejected a
claim by lawyer Thomas Crowe that the prosecution tried to
prejudice the jury by presenting testimony that Crowe said implied
wrongdoing in how the Mecham campaign's checkbook was handled.
   Mecham and his brother, Willard, are charged with concealing the
loan by Tempe developer Barry Wolfson. Willard Mecham was his
brother's 1986 campaign treasurer.
   Also on Friday, former U.S. Rep. Sam Steiger was placed on
probation for four years, fined $5,480, and ordered to perform 700
hours of community service work for pressuring a parole board
member over an administrative matter while working as an aide to
Evan Mecham while Mecham was governor.
   Steiger, 59, was convicted April 7 of theft by extortion in
threatening Board of Pardons and Paroles member Ron Johnson over a
personnel vote.
   In Mecham's trial Thursday, state handwriting expert William
Flynn testified there had been a number of ``white-outs, erasures
and alterations'' in the campaign checkbook. He did not speculate
on the reasons for the changes.
   Crowe contended the revisions were innocent corrections, but the
prosecution implied ``there was something wrong, something
criminal, something improper'' about them.
   ``The effect (on the jury) was devastating,'' Crowe said.
   During the afternoon session, jurors were read portions of
Willard Mecham's January testimony to the state grand jury, in
which he denied wrongdoing when he lumped the $350,000 loan into a
$465,000 total listed on financial reports as a contribution from
Evan Mecham.
   The transcript also showed Willard Mecham said he did not know
about a letter, in which his brother promised Wolfson the loan
would ``remain confidential,'' until after the loan's existence was
publicly disclosed by the news media.
   With the jury not present, the prosecution argued for admission
of testimony by a former Mecham Finance Commitee member who took
notes during a meeting in fall 1986 that say, ``show Evan borrowed
money'' and ``don't show borrowed money.''
   Ryan took the matter under advisement, saying he will rule
before testimony resumes Monday.
   The first-term Republican governor was removed from office April
4 when the state Senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment
counts. The Senate opted not to consider the count against him
related to the loan after some members argued that to do so would
unfairly prejudice his criminal trial.
   The defense contends the failure to report the loan was an
innocent mistake.
   Prosecutor Barnett Lotstein said in court Friday there was no
negative implication in Flynn's testimony about the checkbook. He
said the prosecution was seeking in testimong Thursday to show that
Willard Mecham was a meticulous bookkeeper who was not prone to
mistakes.
   In denying the mistrial motion, Ryan said he thought Flynn's
testimony was ``quite innocuous'' and may prove relevant regarding
Willard Mecham's bookkeeping practices.
   The judge also refused a defense request to admonish the jury
against taking a negative inference from Flynn's testimony.
   The defense Friday also sought the exclusion of testimony about
a number of statements by Willard Mecham to the state grand jury
that indicted the brothers Jan. 8. Ryan granted some of the defense
requests to exclude such testimony but rejected many others.
   Ryan also chided attorneys on both sides, saying they should
have cooperated more fully in deciding what grand jury testimony
would be admitted. ``This is outrageous,'' the judge said after an
hour of arguments on the issue.
   The motions were argued without the jury present and took up
Friday morning's court session.
   The Mecham brothers sat with their attorneys and declined to
comment to reporters.
   In his opening statement Thursday, Lotstein said the Mechams
purposely broke the law when they failed to include the $350,000
loan from Tempe developer Barry Wolfson in personal and campaign
financial reports.
   Mecham faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all six
counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents.
   Willard Mecham faces three similar counts and up to 9{ years in
prison if convicted.
   The Republican governor was removed from office April 4 when the
state Senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment counts. He
took office in January 1987.
   Mecham long has contended the $350,000 loan was properly
reported on his Dec. 5, 1986, financial report. He said it was
included in a $465,000 lump sum that was listed as a contribution
from himself.
   The prosecution has said, however, that Mecham badly needed the
money to keep his campaign afloat and that he concealed it because
Wolfson asked him to and because his campaign had a theme of being
``beholden to no one.''

   Organized crime families linked to Asia are
commanding more attention from U.S. law enforcement officials as
their underworld network expands, a Justice Department lawyer said
Friday.
   ``That's an area where we are going to see more and more growth
and violence,'' said Gary Shapiro, who heads the federal organized
crime strike force in Chicago.
   Speaking as a panel member at the national conference of
Investigative Reporters and Editors, Shapiro said most of the
activity involving gangs of Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese and
Vietnamese criminals has occurred in Los Angeles, New York, San
Francisco, Honolulu and, to a lesser extent, Boston.
   Shapiro said he recently announced an investigation of the
Chinese merchants group, On Leong, in Chicago.
   He said On Leong is ``like a Chinese Chamber of Commerce'' that
has been linked in other cities to gangster activity. In New York,
the group's ``muscle'' is a youth group by the name of Ghost
Shadows, Shapiro said. On Leong members have said their group is a
legitimate merchants' association, Shapiro said.
   Shapiro said an internal Justice Department report issued
recently on Asian organized crime says it is developing rapidly.
The Asian-linked gangs are as sophisticated today as their Italian
counterparts were in the 1930s and 1940s, but they are much more
violent, Shapiro said.
   Asian gangsters also have more ties to their homeland than
Italians ever did, he said.
   Drugs are one of the primary businesses of the Asian mobs, with
Chinese gangs believed to be controlling 70 to 80 percent of the
heroin trade in New York City, Shapiro said.

   A military jury sentenced a
decorated Army sergeant Friday to 10 years in prison for passing
unclassified documents to an FBI agent who was posing as a Russian
spy.
   Sgt. Daniel Walter Richardson, 42, also was ordered to pay a
fine totaling $36,000, demoted in rank and ordered discharged with
a bad conduct record.
   The same jury that convicted Richardson Friday of attempted
espionage deliberated about 2{ hours before issuing its sentence,
concluding a weeklong court-martial.
   ``I'm still taking care of business right now. My lawyers have
advised me not to say anything at this time,'' Richardson said
after the sentence was announced.
   The verdict and sentence are subject to the review and approval
of the commander of Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maj. Gen. George Akin,
and automatically will be appealed to the Army Court of Military
Review.
   Richardson, a 19-year veteran, also was convicted Friday of
stealing government property; of the unauthorized sale of
government property; and failure to report an attempt by an
unauthorized person to obtain classified information. He was
acquitted of a second count of attempted espionage.
   He will continue to draw his Army salary while the conviction is
under review, said Army spokesman R. Rex Brookshire. If the
conviction is upheld, Richardson will lose all pay and pension
benefits upon his discharge, Brookshire said.
   Richardson was found guilty of selling pages of a military
manual and electronic circuitry from the M1 tank.
   Prosecutors had painted Richardson as a man who was greedy and
was willing to sell out his country.
   During the sentencing hearing, chief prosecutor Wellington T.
Matthews called Richardson a crook with ``an anti-social
personality.''
   Defense attorneys said Richardson loved his country, was
distraught over the December 1987 murder of his son, and troubled
by problems of alcoholism, depression and gambling.
   Lawyer David Heubeck urged the jury to be lenient in its
sentence, noting Richardson's combat record in Vietnam. ``He'll be
bothered by those memories. He'll remember that for life. He's
already serving a life sentence for those (memories),'' Heubeck
said.
   The Oakland, Calif., native, who served 2{ tours of duty in
Vietnam and received a commendation for heroism, denied betraying
his country but testified that he gave documents in January to
someone he thought was a KGB agent in hopes of impressing his
supervisors and winning a promotion.
   Richardson, who was demoted for repeatedly failing to come to
work, testified that he wanted to do something ``outstanding'' to
regain his lost stripe and salary.
   ``It seemed like everything I tried to do right, it got screwed
up,'' Richardson testified Thursday. ``I felt that I was under so
much pressure all the time, I felt like I was going to explode from
the inside out.
   ``I figured that I needed to do something to get everybody off
my back.'' Before the jurors began deliberating, Col. Earl Pauley,
the military judge, instructed them to determine whether Richardson
``intended'' to deliver information that would be used to injure
the United States or could be used to the advantage of a foreign
country.
   Pauley said it did not matter whether the act was completed or
whether the material was unclassified. Pauley also said the jury
must consider whether Richardson ``lacked substantial capacity to
form those intents.''
   Richardson was accused of calling the Soviet Embassy in July
1986. The FBI, which obtained a tape of the call, then launched a
lengthy investigation to determine the identity of the caller.
   After that probe was completed, an undercover FBI agent
contacted Richardson in January, and he turned over pages of a
military manual and electronic circuitry from the M1 tank,
prosecutors said.

<HEAD>Jury Clears Blood Bank in AIDS Liability Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury cleared a blood bank of liability Friday
for its role in supplying AIDS-infected blood to a woman who
contracted the disease from a transfusion five years ago.
   The Denver District Court jury found United Blood Services not
liable for damages on the fourth day of deliberations, one day
after finding one doctor liable and another free of responsibility
for the woman's AIDS case.
   Lawyers said the case may be the first in the nation in which a
jury was asked to decide whether a blood bank could be held
responsible for supplying contaminated plasma. A 1986 case in
California reached the courtroom but was settled before it went to
a a jury.
   The Denver jury found no liability on the part of Dr. Edward G.
Merritt, a family physician who formerly treated Susie Quintana for
AIDS. But it ordered Dr. Donald Kearns, an expert in infectious
diseases who first tested Mrs. Quintana for AIDS and said her test
was negative, to pay $70,000 in damages.
   The jury said Kearns was liable because he failed to stop Mrs.
Quintana from exposing her husband to the disease.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread most often through
sexual contact or the sharing of needles or syringes shared by drug
abusers. It also can be transmitted through blood or blood products
infected with the AIDS virus, which damages the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   Mrs. Quintana, 50, and her husband, Chris, 53, of Dolores, were
seeking unspecified damages in their lawsuit, but their attorney
asked for $13 million in damages from the blood bank in closing
arguments.
   An obviously disappointed Mrs. Quintana left the courtroom
without comment.
   Steve Labensky, attorney for the blood bank, said his client
felt ``what they were doing was reasonably prudent at the time, and
apparently the jurors agreed.''
   At one point, the six-member jury had indicated in a note to
Judge John W. Coughlin that it could not reach a decision on the
blood bank's liability. Coughlin instructed jurors to continue
debating the question.
   ``Last night I went home and cried so ...,'' said juror Theresa
Gonzalez in reference to Mrs. Quintana's illness. ``When I took the
oath, I knew I couldn't let that affect me.''
   Mrs. Quintana contracted AIDS from a 1983 blood transfusion at
Southwest Memorial Hospital in Cortez, where she was being treated
for an accidental gunshot wound, according to trial testimony.
United Blood Services' facility in Albuquerque, N.M., supplied the
tainted blood, court records showed.
   During closing arguments in the trial, the Quintanas' attorney,
Maureen Reidy Witt, said the blood bank was negligent for failing
to properly screen donors and test the blood supply.
   She said testing routinely used at the time to determine the
presence of the Hepatitis-B virus in blood could have been useful
in eliminating homosexual blood donors, who belong to a high-risk
category for contracting both diseases.
   However, Douglas Irish, an attorney for the blood bank, said
tests for AIDS in blood were not available until two years after
Mrs. Quintana's transfusion.
   Mrs. Quintana was healthy from outward appearances at the trial,
but doctors said she is undergoing AIDS-related treatment from a
physician in Tucson, Ariz.

   Jesse Jackson campaigned Friday in sunny
New Mexico and told the region's environmental constituency their
concerns are ``no longer a fringe issue'' but are central to human
existence.
   Heading down the home stretch to Tuesday's final primaries in
New Mexico, California, Montana and New Jersey, the Democratic
candidate also said he is still running to win the presidential
election.
   Jackson said he did not know the context of reported comments by
his campaign manager, Gerald Austin, that the strongest Democratic
ticket would be front-runner Michael Dukakis and Sen. John Glenn of
Ohio.
   Jackson told reporters not to ``take that seriously.''
   Austin was quoted in the Boston Herald as saying Jackson was his
first choice for vice president but that Glenn would make for an
almost unbeatable ticket. But Jackson told reporters Austin's
comments did not reflect any thinking on his part that he did not
want the vice presidential spot or that he has made any decision in
the matter.
   ``We are running to win the last four contests on June 7. We'll
then exercise our options for June 8 and beyond,'' he said, adding
that Austin is in good standing with the campaign and ``his
position is secure.''
   Jackson maintains he deserves consideration for the vice
presidential nomination if Dukakis wins and has said that if he
wins, he'll consider Dukakis.
   Jackson spoke to more than 1,500 people on a sun-baked plaza
surrounded by Sante Fe's trademark Indian sidewalk vendors who sell
an array of turquoise and silver jewelry.
   He spoke of the controversy over federal plans to store nuclear
waste near Carlsbad and said, ``safety before waste, that must be
your watchword.''
   The issue of nuclear waste storage and toxic dumps ``is no
longer a fringe issue,'' he said. ``Environmental protection is
central to our existence. ... It goes to the heart of the American
dream. I stand to protect that dream.''
   Jackson also told the audience of whites, Indians and Hispanics
that the many scientists and engineers who work on military
projects in New Mexico are being ``held hostage'' to the military
economy.
   Those scientific minds should be put to work instead on space
development, research on medical advances, global communications
and technical work to verify arms agreements, he said.
   Referring to President Reagan's recent summit meeting in Moscow,
Jackson said to applause, ``I want to respect all our people. If we
can honor an agreement with Russia we can honor an agreement with
American Indians.''
   Jackson was joined at the rally by Buffy Sainte-Marie, a singer
of Indian heritage, who traveled with the campaign from Los Angeles.
   Jackson later Friday campaigned in Montana, which has just 19
delegates at stake on Tuesday, and said at a rally in Bozeman: ``We
cannot measure human beings and their needs just by their political
capital. ... It's their humanity that's at stake.''
   Later, he spoke at a dinner sponsored by the state Democratic
Party in Butte, where he was warmly received by the few hundred in
attendance, most of whom wore Dukakis buttons.
   He offered a prayer for Dukakis' wife, Kitty, who underwent
spinal surgery on Friday.
   He then headed to Bakersfield, Calif., for the night. In nearby
McFarland, Calif., he planned to spend much of Saturday with a
march and rally centered around the mysteriously high cancer rate
in the small central valley town.
   Jackson had taken up the McFarland issue as a central cause of
his campaign in its closing days. He mentioned it in all his Los
Angeles speeches over the past two days. He called on supporters to
join him in McFarland to call for government action in finding and
correcting the cause of the cancer.

   A war relic that a youngster packed aboard a
flight from Europe caused a bomb scare and partial evacuation
Friday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, authorities said.
   The artillery shell, picked up from a European battlefield by a
youth on a bicycle trip, dropped out of a bicycle box being
unloaded from Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 937 from
Copenhagen, Denmark, Port of Seattle police Chief Ed Ingram said.
   FBI agents questioned ``four young adults, three girls and one
boy,'' then released them to their parents, said airport
spokeswoman Margo Spellman.
   The youths said the boy who packed the shell in the box was
still in Europe, Ms. Spellman said.
   The youths were part of a tour group from the Bush School, a
private Seattle school, KING-TV reported.
   The shell came from a bunker in France, said Leif Eie, an SAS
spokesman in Seattle. She said transporting the shell wasn't
illegal because ``we permit live ammunition in the baggage
department like all other carriers.''
   ``We're still not sure if it's alive,'' said Ingram, who added
that explosive experts were photographing and studying the relic.
He was unsure of its age.
   The device was about a foot long and three inches in diameter,
Ms. Spellman said.
   The shell was loaded into a steel drum and taken by truck to a
concrete bomb bunker away from the terminal, where it was found
shortly after 2 p.m. That terminal, a satellite of the main
terminal normally used by Northwest Airlines, Japan Air lines and
Scandanavian Airlines, was reopened about 3:20 p.m., Ms. Spellman
said.
   People considered in a danger zone were evacuated almost
imediately, and a bomb squad and canine unit checked the area, Ms.
Spellman said.
   Sea-Tac has two satellite terminals or concourses separate from
its main terminal that are reached by subway trains.
   Ms. Spellman did not immediately know how many gates, flights or
passengers were affected by the closure.
   SAS spokeswoman Eileen Drutman in Los Angeles said she had no
information about the situation but that airline officials were
investigating it.
   One flight known to have been delayed was Northwest Airlines
Flight 156, which was scheduled to carry about 120 people to
Minneapolis-St. Paul, said Bob Gibbons, a Northwest spokesman in
St. Paul.

   Massive peasant protests are
getting bigger, bloodier and more frequent, signaling strains on
Colombia's centuries-old social system in which the rich get richer
and the poor stay barefoot and hungry.
   Since President Virgilio Barco took office on Aug. 7, 1986,
peasants have conducted 80 rural marches, some of them numbering
more than 10,000 people,
   The latest marches began May 22 when thousands of peasants
gathered at a half dozen spots throughout the north.
   One near the mountain town of San Vicente, about 160 miles north
of the capital, ended in gunfire, leaving 10 peasants, an army
colonel and two other soldiers dead.
   The protests indicated the government appears unwilling to
reform its economic system. They also showed a surprising unity
among unions, peasants and leftist parties _ in their discontent if
not in their goals.

   He held his news conference in the same hall where Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday held his first formal meeting

   Unemployment increased for the first time this
year to 5.6 percent in May, the Labor Department said Friday. But
both government officials and private economists cautioned that the
job figures for last month are too unreliable to suggest that the
economy is losing steam.
   The 0.2 percentage point increase from April's 14-year-low
civilian jobless rate of 5.4 percent reflected a seasonally
adjusted shrinking of the U.S. labor force by 363,000 people, with
536,000 fewer Americans at work.
   But before the seasonal adjustments made in the government's
household survey to reflect an historically burgeoning job market
in May with the end of school terms, the actual number of people
working increased by 317,000.

   The Pentagon's drug coordinator listed for
Congress on Friday a series of obstacles the military faces in
playing an expanded role in the drug war, among them planes too
fast to catch the little aircraft smugglers use and military police
not trained to read people their rights.
   Marine Lt. Gen. Stephen G. Olmstead, deputy assistant secretary
of defense for drug policy and enforcement, noted that the Joint
Chiefs of Staff are preparing a plan for an escalated military
anti-drug effort. Such an expanded military presence in the fight
against drugs is part of legislation authorizing the Pentagon's
spending programs for the upcoming fiscal year.
   One solution to detecting drug smugglers flying over the
U.S.-Mexican border, Olmstead told a House Government Operations
subcommittee, would be to use airborne detection planes: the Air
Force AWACS, the Navy's E2C and the Navy's P-3.

   Iraqiy drove off an
Iranian warplane that flew 110 miles into Iraq and tried to bomb
President Saddam Hussein's family home north of Baghdad, a mil forces on
Fridaitary
command announced.
   While maneuvering to evade Iraqi ground fire, the Iranian jet
``dropped all its load of explosives indiscriminately'' in the
village of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, Saddam's hometown, the
official Iraqi News Agency said.
   No injuries were reported in the attack at 5:55 a.m., according
to the news agency. The report, monitored in Nicosia, did not say
whether Saddam was home at the time. It was the first time the
Iraqis have reported an ate early-warning radar planes pending overhauls
to
strengthen their wings, officials said Friday.
   According to one Navy source, 28 of the 98 Hawkeyes now in
service have been grounded until they can receive the overhaul work
by the Grumman Corp.
   The disclosure that such a large percentage of the
``eye-in-the-sky'' surveillance planes are now grounded was made
Friday during congressional testimony by Marine Lt. Gen. Stephen G.
Olmstead, deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug policy and
enforcement.
   Olmstead appeared before a House Government Operations
subcommittee to discuss proposals to increase the military's role
in the war on drug smuggling. In the process, he informed the panel
the Navy's E-2C's were ``in bad trouble with cracked wing
problems.''
   ``The Navy has a major rehabilitation problem,'' the general
continued, saying 34 out of a fleet of 85 were out of service.
   ``I'm not sure any would be available (for a crackdown on
smuggling). We have just reduced the force by a drastic number the
past year.''
   The Navy declined to discuss the matter late Friday. But several
sources who spoke only on condition they not be named acknowledged
the service was facing a serious problem, while adding they could
not confirm the general's figures.
   According to the sources, there are 98 Hawkeyes now in the U.S.
inventory instead of the 85 cited by Olmstead. Of that total, four
are assigned to the Coast Guard and Customs Service for drug
interdiction work.
   Those four planes have not been grounded, however, so all 28 now
under flight restriction are assigned to the military, the sources
continued. Even with the groundings, the officials insisted the
Navy has enough of the planes to equip its aircraft carriers when
they go out on a deployment.
   The E-2C is a twin-engine turbo-prop that carries a large,
rotating radar dome atop its fuselage. Hawkeyes recently have
played critical roles maintaining surveillance and directing combat
operations in the Persian Gulf. In October 1985, an E-2C guided the
fighters that intercepted a plane carrying the hijackers of the
Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro.
   The Navy first disclosed the wing fatigue problem in February
1987, announcing that seven of the planes had been grounded and 10
prohibited from operating off aircraft carriers.
   The service has stressed from the beginning it did not blame the
plane's prime contractor, the Grumman Corp., for the wing fatigue
problem. Rather, in order to modernize the plane over the years,
more sophisticated and heavier radar and communications equipment
had to be added, the Navy explained.
   The original ``A'' model of the plane, for example, weighed
roughly 48,000 pounds, while the current ``C'' model weighs at
least 52,500 pounds.
   Given the constant poundings of carrier take-offs and landings,
that extra weight has placed more stress on the Hawkeye wings than
they were originally designed to handle. As the planes age, most of
them will have to undergo the wing overhauls, the Navy says.
   Larry Hamilton, a Grumman spokesman, said the company has
completed three Hawkeye overhauls and now has five planes
undergoing the work at a facility in St. Augustine, Fla.
   Hamilton said two of the planes assigned to the Coast Guard and
Customs Service had required some wing work this spring, but added
that work involved a different problem ``and eventually, they'll
have to come back'' for the overhaul.
   According to the Navy, it costs about $250,000 to overhaul a
single wing and $600,000 if a wing has to be replaced.

<TEXT>
   This year's 41st Cannes Film Festival may
have come and gone, but its hubbub has been preserved on-screen in
a film that brings into comic focus the cinema's most frenzied
annual shindig.
   ``It's taken 40 years for the image and notoriety of Cannes to
catch up with itself so you can do a satire about it,'' said Walter
Robin, producer of ``Starlets,'' a $4 million movie that recently
completed four days of preliminary shooting at this year's Cannes
Festival.
   The movie, which will resume filming in southern Europe at the
end of September, stars Tony Curtis as Sidney F. Berko, the founder
and chairman of a fictional film company known as Important
Pictures. Berko, based according to Robin ``on every mogul there
ever was,'' is sponsoring an ``International New Star of the Year
Contest'' at the annual movie confab in Cannes.
   John Hurt, in a rare comic appearance, co-stars as the Soviet
Nikita Vladimirov, a KGB agent and former actor who arrives in
Cannes to accompany Miss Moscow in Berko's talent competition.
   Irina Brook, daughter of theater director Peter Brook, plays the
Soviet contestant, Natasha, and Pamela Stephenson appears as her
sponsor, none other than Raisa Gorbachev.
   ``It's an out-and-out comedy. It would be pointless doing it if
I didn't think it was funny,'' said Hurt, who is better-known for
his critically acclaimed dramatic portrayals in such films as ``The
Elephant Man,'' ``Midnight Express'' and ``1984.'' He currently
appears in ``White Mischief'' with Sarah Miles and Charles Dance.
   Hurt's last comic appearance on-screen was in the 1982 flop,
``Partners.'' However, the actor maintains that being funny
on-screen is serious business.
   ``There's no question that comedy is the most difficult (thing)
to play,'' the wiry 48-year-old actor said. ``You can get away with
nearly making someone cry, but you can't get away with nearly
making someone laugh.''
   Before ``Starlets'' starts shooting again in September, Hurt
will have completed two more films: ``Scandal,'' with Joanne
Whalley, which already is in production, and ``Before She Met Me,''
with Isabelle Huppert which begins shooting at the end of August.
   The actor said he felt fortunate to be regularly employed.
   ``I'm one of life's fortunate people to be doing what I actually
want to do and to come from a country where I've been encouraged to
do it,'' he said. ``You can't ask for more than that.''
   But he said he was personally wary of the hype and glitz of
Cannes.
   ``If you were to take seriously the offers made at Cannes, you'd
be a very silly person indeed,'' said Hurt, who first came to the
Riviera town in 1978 when ``Midnight Express'' and ``The Shout''
were shown at the Festival.
   ``You get offered three films a day here.''
   And when is ``Starlets'' scheduled to have its world premier?
You guessed it: Cannes. In 1989.

<HEAD>Black Housing Shortage Poses Dilemma for South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Within an hour's drive of the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the hub of Africa's richest economy,
live roughly a million black squatters in shantytowns and backyard
shacks.
   Even in their squalor, many are under constant threat of
eviction. How to deal with the squatters, and with a severe
nationwide housing shortage for blacks, is one of the apartheid
government's most difficult dilemmas.
   In theory, the country's white leaders favor black
homeownership, believing it promotes middle-class values and
undercuts support for revolutionary change. In practice, the
government is providing only a small fraction of the land, houses
and funds needed to resolve the crisis.
   ``The desperate lack of homes for those in the lower income
groups is like a time bomb,'' The Sowetan, the largest
black-oriented daily newspaper, said in a recent editorial.
   Squatting and homelessness are decades-old problems in South
Africa, but the situation has worsened since 1986, when the
government abolished the so-called pass laws that restricted the
rights of blacks to live in urban areas.
   Tens of thousands of blacks who previously feared arrest or
forced removal have set up shacks on the outskirts of the big
cities, where job opportunities are better.
   The population of the Mofolo squatter camp in Soweto,
Johannesburg's main black township, has mushroomed to an estimated
40,000 since it was established in 1986. Soweto's black
administration charges the squatters rent but provides virtually no
services.
   In Soweto and other similar townships, black local officials
often have initiated efforts to evict squatters and demolish their
homes.
   The Black Sash civil rights group has called for a moratorium on
squatting arrests and demolitions until alternative sites are
provided.
   ``These people have nowhere to live,'' said a recent Black Sash
report. ``They are not living in these illegal and hopeless
conditions because they want to.''
   The government professes concern about the squatters' plight,
yet it is toughening anti-squatting laws.
   Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis says
legislation is being drafted to increase the maximum penalties for
illegal squatting to a $5,000 fine or five years in jail.
   He said provisions would be made to allow for compulsory,
summary evictions of squatters, even those who contend that they
have permission from a landowner.
   Along with these proposals, the government has appointed
planning experts to identify white-owned land in the
Johannesburg-Pretoria area that could be allocated for new black
townships. But this endeavor is complicated by protests from whites
who do not want large black settlements near their homes.
   Weiler's Farm, one of the few squatter camps formally recognized
by the government, is due to be eliminated later this year
following complaints by whites that the presence of blacks has
boosted crime and depressed property values.
   ``The squatter problem is like measles _ it spreads all over,''
said Koos van der Merwe, who represents the area for the far-right
Conservative Party in Parliament.
   Weiler's Farm, 25 miles south of Johannesburg, has grown in two
years from 2,000 to more than 8,000 residents. They are due to be
moved in October to a site further from Johannesburg.
   The government estimates South Africa's housing backlog at more
than 700,000 units. Some experts calculate that 5 million blacks,
almost one in every five, are without a permanent, legal home.
   It is estimated that by the year 2000, about 2 million new homes
will be needed, or more than 200,000 a year at an annual cost of
roughly $2.25 billion.
   The private sector has assumed a major role in trying to reduce
the housing backlog. Last year, the South African Housing Trust was
formed, with the government providing the rand equivalent of $200
million on the understanding that business groups would contribute
twice that amount.
   But even if this program is sustained through the end of the
century, it would supply barely one-fourth of the funds needed to
meet black housing demands.
   The Housing Trust seeks to provide homes at a cost of about
$7,000, to be purchased with installment payments of $58 a month.
   However, experts estimate that only 25 percent of South Africa's
blacks can make a meaningful contribution toward housing costs.
Most squatters, and many other blacks, earn no more than $100 a
month.
   Asked if they could provide homes at less than $2,500, a cost
perhaps within reach for a majority of black families, officials of
the Housing Trust reported: ``The odds are against us having
success.''

<HEAD>Consumerism of Another Sort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new consumer movement appears to be under way
that seems capable of doing what an earlier period of consumerism
failed to accomplish.
   Evidence of its success is all about us day after day, and now
it is being documented by some hard economic numbers. In a sense,
it may be so pervasive as to have gone almost unnoticed.
   It contrasts sharply with the earlier consumer movement that,
arising in the 1960s and extending into the 1970s, helped improve
the quality and safety of products, improved the work place, and
raised environmental consciousness.
   In spite of the good it did, however, the earlier movement
suffered a grand failure: It did little or nothing to keep prices
in line, and one of America's worst periods of inflation
overwhelmed buyers during the 1970s.
   The current consumer movement is aimed almost entirely at
prices, and it appears to be working. Buyers are resisting efforts
of producers and sellers to raise prices. Relative to the 1970s,
therefore, inflation is mild.
   The resistance of consumers can be seen in various retail
markets, but none more clearly than in automobiles and apparel.
   Automobile rebates and discounts, originally aimed at giving a
quick, one-time boost to sales, have become a continuing feature of
the car market. Remove incentives, carmakers and dealers have
found, and sales decline.
   The biggest recent contributor to inflation was a surge in
apparel costs. But simultaneously apparel retailers have reported
weakened sales, especially for women's clothes, suggesting consumer
resistance will end that threat.
   Seeking an explanation for the effectiveness of consumer
resistance today, especially since it failed in the 1970s, analysts
at Wright Investors' Service have found a distinct economic
disparity.
   During the earlier period, they state, consumer reponse to
higher prices was tempered by, among other things, the inability to
resist such developments as the oil price increases dictated by
foreign producers.
   In addition, consumers often had the ability to offset higher
prices by means of the then-popular cost-of-living adjustments that
lifted their pay by a similar percentage.
   Moreover, some price increases then were deemed irrelevant to
consumers. Health-care costs, rising even faser than they are now,
were sometimes offset by insurance coverage paid fully rather than
partially by employers.
   Today, consumers appear to be in a position to make difficult
the price increases that came so easily during the 1970s. Increases
are in areas where consumers have options, chief of which is that
of not buying.
   Thus, says Wright, U.S. business has been reluctant to raise
prices despite the window of opportunity provided by the dollar's
decline over the past three years.
   Statistical support for the contention comes from a study of two
measures of inflation, the gross national product implicit price
deflator, and the GNP fixed-weight price index.
   The implicit price deflator registered an inflation rate of only
1.7 percent for the first quarter of 1988. The fixed-weight price
index rose more than twice as fast, registering 3.6 percent.
   The significance: The fixed-weight price index measures only
price changes. But the implicit price deflator measures not just
price changes but also changes in GNP makeup.
   The fast-rising index maintains the same weight for items in the
so-called marketbasket regardless of changes in buying patterns.
The slower-moving index reflects changes in the buying patterns of
households and businesses.
   Interpretation: Reacting to price changes, businesses and
households are switching to lower-price purchases.
   The pattern is established; it has existed since the early
1980s, Wright says.
   In short, buyers are more firmly in the driver's seat than
during the earlier consumer movement. They are practicing their
free-market right to buy price-attractive goods and reject those
less attractive.
   Domestic producers know it, and so do exporters into the
American market. In a price-sensitive environment they seem to have
concluded it is simply good business to watch the price tags, just
as consumers are doing.

<HEAD>Next Fall: More Families, Movie Spinoffs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that the networks have announced their fall
schedules, let the trend-noting begin.
   Even though Nielsen figures show viewers are becoming
increasingly disenchanted with network television, the networks
seem to think what audiences want to watch on TV is TV. Four
comedies slated for next season are set in the wacky world of
television:
   _``TV101'' on CBS, from GTG Entertainment, Grant Tinker's new
production company, is about a journalism teacher (Sam Robards) who
returns to his high school alma mater to teach the kids about TV
reportage.
   _``Studio 5B'' on ABC is set in the morning news show milieu,
the title a reference to Studio 3B from which NBC's ``Today'' show
originates.
   _``Murphy Brown'' on CBS stars Candice Bergen as a barely
coping, high-profile TV news personality recently released from the
Betty Ford Clinic.
   _``A Fine Romance'' on ABC features Anthony Andrews and Margaret
Whitton as a divorced couple who continue as co-hosts of a
television show.
   Gone are ``dramedies'' for the most part. ABC canceled ``The
`Slap' Maxwell Story,'' and NBC is expected to drop ``The Days and
Nights of Molly Dodd'' after its current run. But CBS is holding
onto ``Frank's Place,'' perhaps the best new show last season, as a
midseason returnee. ``Hooperman'' on ABC was the only real success
of the four that premiered last fall.
   Gone is ``St. Elsewhere,'' itself a trend marking the end of an
era.
   Back are old standbys and tried-and-true troupers. Mary Tyler
Moore is back on CBS in a new comedy, as is her one-time co-star
Dick Van Dyke in a separate show. Peter Falk returns as ``Columbo''
on ABC in a rotating series that also features Burt Reynolds as a
private eye.
   There will be more so-called ``tabloid TV.'' NBC makes a regular
series out of its popular ``Unsolved Mysteries'' specials. ABC
offers ``Incredible Sunday,'' a remake of ``That's Incredible.''
   There are two movie spinoffs: NBC's ``Baby Boom'' casts Kate
Jackson (``Scarecrow and Mrs. King'') in the role Diane Keaton
created in the movie of the same name about a high-powered
executive who inherits an infant. CBS has Patrick Cassidy and
Melora Hardin playing the Patrick Swayze-Jennifer Grey roles in
``Dirty Dancing.''
   History offers no encouragement for these two. The last time a
movie spinoff was a big hit was ``Alice,'' the long-running sitcom
based on the movie ``Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.'' ``Starman''
premiered in 1986, but only lasted a season. This season's
``Supercarrier,'' a thinly veiled version of the hit movie ``Top
Gun,'' soon sank.
   There are a more families next season, but the ``The Cosby
Show'' won't have to worry about competition from other typical,
nuclear families in the neighborhood. TV likes one-parent
households.
   This season, moms fared poorly:
   _``Full House,'' mother dead;
   _``My Two Dads,'' mother dead;
   _``Valerie's Family,'' mother dead;
   _``I Married Dora,'' mother dead.
   Next season's families are missing moms and dads through
combinations of death and divorce and selfishness.
   _``Baby Boom,'' mother single;
   _Mary Tyler Moore's show, mother divorced;
   _``Close to Home,'' mother off finding self;
   _``Dear John,'' husband divorced;
   _``Empty Nest,'' mother dead;
   _``The Robert Guillaume Show,'' father divorced;
   _``Paradise,'' children inherited, sister dead.
   NBC, which was accused by some critics of playing it safe with
its fall schedule, seems to have created two new categories:
   _``Tattinger's'' establishes the
romance-comedy-drama-set-in-popular-New York-restaurant genre; and
   _``Midnight Caller'' creates an
ex-cop-turned-late-night-radio-talk-show-host formula.
   It isn't hard to predict the hits among the new shows _ just
look at what NBC put in its Thursday and Saturday lineups: ``Dear
John'' starring Judd Hirsch follows ``Cheers'' on Thursday; ``Empty
Nest'' with Richard Mulligan is spun off and follows ``Golden
Girls'' on Saturday.
   And ABC is giving ``Rosanne,'' a sitcom starring the
wisecracking comic Roseanne Barr, a space in its successful Tuesday
night lineup.

   Elsewhere in television:
   EMMY NIGHT LIVE _ Lorne Michaels, executive producer of NBC's
``Saturday Night Live,'' has signed to produce the 40th Annual Emmy
Awards on Fox. The celebration of television excellence airs live
Aug. 28, for the second year on the fledgling network. Fox hopes
Michaels will infuse the overlong, often leaden event with some
wit. Michaels himself has won six Emmies. ...
   STARS' FAVORITE SOAPS _ Bette Davis loves ``As the World Turns''
and ``Guiding Light,'' Sammy Davis watches ``Ryan's Hope'' and
``General Hospital'' every day, Carol Burnett made an appearance on
her favorite daytime drama, ``All My Children,'' and Aretha
Franklin adores ``The Young and the Restless.'' These soap-lovers'
confessions are contained in the June 28 issue of Soap Opera
Digest, which goes on to reveal that Crystal Gayle watches
``Another World'' along with the guys in her band and that Nancy
Culp, who played Miss Hathaway on ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' is a
``Santa Barbara'' addict.

<DATELINE>LUANG PRABANG, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The king was taken away 11 years ago
by communist rulers, but Luang Prabang retains much of its royal
charm, nestled among misty mountains and surging rivers _ a
still-peaceful repository of Buddhism and the finest in Laotian
culture.
   Despite peeling plaster and ramshackle eaves, the old royal
capital _ bypassed by war, mass tourism and commercial development
_ is one of the last places to find old Indochina, indeed old Asia.
   Thirteen years after communist revolutionaries marched into
``Never-Never Land,'' victorious in the Indochina war, Luang
Prabang and many of its 23,000 people cling fervently to the Lord
Buddha.
   At dawn, lines of saffron-robed monks pad through the streets,
emerging from the town's 57 peaked-roof temples to accept rice and
curries from the faithful in a centuries-old ritual.
   The area's Communist Party chief, Vongphet Salykeyachongtoua,
says 300 monks and novices are still here, fewer than before the
communist victory but a considerable number even by standards of
countries where Buddhism is actively encouraged.
   ``We consider religion as the traditional habit of the people,''
Vongphet told visiting Western journalists. ``Buddhism teaches that
people should be good to each other _ same as the party.''
   But he added that laymen now must seek official permission to
join the monkhood, and once enrobed they should help society and
the revolution.
   Luang Prabang's exquisite shrines, in which communist
authorities take considerable pride, seem to be maintained,
although some are in need of extensive repairs. Monsoon rains spill
into the interior of the Wat Mai monastery through holes in the
roof. Murals have been bleached. The gilding has faded on some of
the exquisite exterior reliefs.
   Next door is the former royal palace, now a museum to which the
general public is allowed only periodic access.
   This modest, one-story building served as the residence of the
missing King Savang Vatthana, last of a royal line that goes back
to the mid-14th century when Prince Fa Ngoum carved out an
extensive and powerful Laotian kingdom.
   King Savang, a devout Buddhist, led a secluded life, keeping
mostly to his palace where courtiers and officials approached him
on bended knees. Today, his outer rooms and throne hall are mounted
with displays of royal regalia, precious Buddha images by the
hundreds, and gifts from world leaders.
   On display still is a sliver of moon rock from a 1972 U.S.
Apollo space mission and a pen set from President John F. Kennedy.
Leonid I. Brezhnev, the late Soviet leader, had sent a shotgun. The
late Chairman Mao Tse-tung of China sent teacups. On the palace
grounds, water buffalos graze contentedly on the grass.
   The king and members of his family were taken from Luang Prabang
in 1977, and a number of refugee reports say he died in a communist
re-education camp. Communist officials refuse to say whether he is
dead or alive, and steer conversations about the royal past to
econonic developments and the future.
   Luang Prabang is officially the country's poorest province. Its
subsistence farmers have been hit by periodic droughts and its once
rich forests ravaged by migratory hilltribes through slash-and-burn
agriculture. High up the Mekong River, a rough, two-day's road
journey from the capital of Vientiane, the town remains isolated.
   But communist chief Vongphet said Laos' new economic reforms
have given incentive to local farmers to produce more while foreign
donors have provided emergency food aid and long-term assistance.
The United Nations has a reforestation project under way. American
Mennonites are trying to develop small-scale hydroelectric dams.
Cuban volunteers work in the local hospital.
   Meagerly stocked not long ago, the town's main markets now are
bustling. Most consumer goods come from neighboring Thailand, and a
recent warming of relations with China has sparked cross-border
barter trade. Laos offers various jungle products for batteries,
toothpaste and medicines.
   Enterprising vendors like Thongchin Chitdalin turn cheap Soviet
material into jeans, sewing on a fake label of the American
jeans-maker Levi Strauss to attract buyers. Others fashion empty
Heineken beer cans into wick lamps
   The market women are jovial, cracking jokes and exchanging
gossip.
   Along the Mekong, knots of townsfolk passed a recent languid
afternoon as temple bells sounded in the distance. Schoolgirls in
blue sarongs and white blouses pedalled their bikes along shady,
motor-free streets, smiling at strangers.
   ``Bo Pen Yang'' is an old Laotian saying still heard in Luang
Prabang: ``Don't Worry, Take It Easy, Let Things Flow.''

<HEAD>A Buoyant, Bittersweet `School for Wives' at the Hartford Stage
Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sound of Fred Astaire singing ``Night
and Day'' floats through the theater as the house lights dim and
the play begins.
   It's an anachronistic but totally appropriate introduction to
Moliere's ``The School for Wives,'' a 17th-century comedy about
obsessive love, a subject Cole Porter's most haunting melody and
lyrics also celebrate.
   Director Mark Lamos and actor Gerry Bamman perfectly capture
that obsession in a buoyant yet bittersweet production of ``The
School for Wives,'' now running at the Hartford Stage Company.
   Bamman, relatively unknown on Broadway but who has made his mark
in regional theaters like Hartford and the Guthrie in Minneapolis,
is a revelation. He exudes a self-satisfaction that is most
delightful when it is deflated. The actor plays Arnolphe, a smug
middle-class gentleman who raises his young female ward, Agnes, to
be what he considers a perfect wife _ sweet, obedient and
empty-headed.
   Lamos has set ``The School for Wives'' in what looks like late
19th or early 20th century France. He gives it a quaint charm that
suggests the early films of Rene Clair, particularly his silent
classic, ``The Italian Straw Hat.''
   A soft pastel glow envelopes the production. There's a circus
feeling to the evening, accentuated by designer John Arnone's
storybook French farmhouse. The characters, some wearing white
pancake makeup, resemble clowns. Arnolphe looks like a bourgeois
Charlie Chaplin, complete with that smidgen of a mustache and a
bowler hat.
   Bamman expertly negotiates the play's poetry _ showcased in
Richard Wilbur's graceful and witty adaptation _ as well as its
pratfalls. He's an expert vaudevillian, a master of the slow burn
and double take worthy of a Jackie Gleason or a Bert Lahr.
   For a 300-year-old play, ``The School for Wives'' reverberates
with a modern sensibility about women and their roles in marriage
and a society dictated by men. Arnolphe desires an uncomplicated
wife _ one, he says, who will say her prayers, spin, sew and love
him. And he gets none of it.
   Arnolphe's exasperation grows more desperate and more hilarious
as his fiancee becomes more confident in herself. Her
singlemindedness strengthens after she falls in love with Horace, a
handsome young man.
   A lovely Barbara Howard makes the transformation of Agnes _ from
an innocent into an intelligent, questioning woman _ something to
savor. Her declaration of independence from her possessive guardian
should win cheers from the least militant of feminists.
   Lamos has surrounded his leading players with a fine assortment
of character actors, as distinct for their physicality as their
emoting. Eric Swanson is an impassioned, jittery neophyte suitor;
Don R. McManus and Alice Haining as Arnolphe's exasperating
servants get a few laughs from some low hijinks, and Ian Trigger is
deliriously funny as a pint-size notary.
   But Lamos coaxes something more from this ``School for Wives''
than laughs.
   Arnolphe's defeat is not unexpected, but it is surprisingly
moving considering the laughter that goes before it. By the end of
the play, Bamman has revealed the hurt as well as the humor in this
pompous man's loss of a wife as well as his dignity.
   And it's not only Arnolphe who faces a bitter truth. When Horace
finally wins Agnes, he retreats with the rest of the men to the
side of the stage. Agnes watches their clubby masculine conclave
with the realization that her schooling in the battle of the sexes
is far from over. It's a brilliant tableau.
   This production, originally done with the same two leads at the
La Jolla Playhouse in California last summer, is as memorable as
the delectable and laugh-filled Broadway revival that starred Brian
Bedford and Joan Van Ark more than 15 years ago.
   However, Lamos has taken the play a step further. In his
``School for Wives,'' the director shows that an education in love
can be just as difficult for the teacher as it is for the student.

<HEAD>Japan Becoming Biggest Aid Donor to Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan soon will surpass the United States as the
world's biggest donor of foreign development aid. It is both proud
and wary of its new role.
   The strength of the yen helped to propel the country toward
leadership in the broad category of aid called Official Development
Assistance. ODA, as it is known, does not include military aid, and
Japanese officials like to call it ``pure'' aid.
   ``The Japanese are not yet used to the position of a country
which is expected to (provide) _ and which is providing _ the
largest ODA,'' said Masamichi Hanabusa, the Foreign Ministry's top
aid official.
   ``With that status substantial responsibility will follow.''
   About 70 percent of Japan's aid goes to Asian countries. The
biggest recipient is China, a country that does not receive U.S.
development aid.
   As often was the case with the United States as the leading aid
donor, the Japanese government has been criticized at home on
grounds that through aid it is buttressing dictators or fueling
corruption. At the same time, aid recipients have pleaded for more
grants or complained about loan terms.
   Until about 10 years ago Japan's development aid served mostly
to promote its own exports and assure its supply of raw materials,
Juichi Inada writes in the current issue of the scholarly
semi-annual, Japan Review of International Affairs.
   Resentment of too much Japanese self-interest led to a change in
policy, Inada adds, and in 1977 the government announced it would
triple aid in three years, with emphasis on the general promotion
of peace and prosperity.
   By 1985 Japan's development aid had grown to $3.8 billion,
trailing only France at $3.99 billion and the United States at $9.4
billion.
   Late that year the Western powers agreed to cut the value of the
dollar. The yen soared more than other currencies, and the dollar
value of Japan's aid rose 47 percent in 1986 to $5.6 billion,
second to the United States' $9.8 billion.
   When the 1987 disbursement figures are in, Japan's aid will have
grown to about $7.4 billion, Hanabusa said, and the budget for the
Japanese fiscal year that started April 1 calls for spending $10
billion.
   Since U.S. aid is held down by Washington's budget restraints,
the Japanese feel they will overtake the United States in this
fiscal year. The United States spend $8.8 billion on development
aid in 1987.
   The U.S. government has encouraged Japan to expand its
development aid.
   The U.S. deputy defense secretary, William Howard Taft IV, told
the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee May 26 that Japan
not only will surpass the United States this year, it also can
afford a further ``dramatic increase.''
   Measured against the size of the economy, Japan's aid is not
outstandingly generous. This year it will be about 0.3 percent of
the gross national product, higher than the U.S. rate of 0.23
percent but below the average of 0.36 percent among major Western
donor countries.
   Japan is expected to announce a further increase in aid at the
Toronto summit of the seven big free-market democracies June 19-21.
   More than 40 percent of the increase in Japan's aid is due to
the higher value of the yen, said Hanabusa, who is director-general
of the Economic Cooperation Bureau in the Foreign Ministry.
   He pointed out that the aid outlay also has risen in yen, even
though the overall government budget is frozen. This, he said,
demonstrates a strong commitment to development aid.
   The yen's strength has caused trouble for countries that took
yen loans and now have to repay by earning devalued dollars.
   ``This is not our fault,'' Hanabusa said. Japan has provided new
loans to such borrowers and reduced interest rates to an average of
2.6 percent.
   ``But here it is a bit difficult for us to satisfy those
borrowers completely,'' he said in an interview.
   Giving aid can be a vexing responsibility, Hanabusa added,
citing as an example the Philippines, where Japan is the largest
single donor to the government of President Corazon Aquino.
   ``We have doubled our assistance last year, but we are a little
ill at ease,'' he said. ``We are not controlling that country,
which we shouldn't. We really don't know that what we do is
actually taking effect.''
   Some critics in Thailand claim Japanese aid is intended mostly
to benefit Japanese contructions companies. Hanabusa denied the
charge. Japanese aid helped build a concert hall in Thailand.
   Japanese aid was a major factor in Indonesia's becoming
self-sufficient in rice, Hanabusa said.
   Hanabusa acknowledged that Japan, like other countries, has an
element of self-interest in giving aid.
   But, he said, ``Japanese aid is purer than the others in that we
have no colonial inclination, we have no strategic consideration,
we have no wish to impose our will on others.''

<HEAD>`To Be a Jew and a Southerner' _ Cultures Blend as Migration Grows</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LEANNE WAXMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Jews have lived in the South for more than 200 years, but their
history as a subgroup has long been ignored. Their religious roots
and desire to fit in alongside their often fundamentalist Christian
neighbors have produced a cultural blending that sets them apart
from the American Jewish establishment.
   ``I am not certain what it means to be both a Jew and a
Southerner,'' Eli Evans wrote in his personal account of growing up
in Durham, N.C. ``To have inherited the Jewish longing for a
homeland while being raised with the Southerner's sense of home.''
   The Sunbelt is home for more Jews now. The Jewish population in
the South has grown to about 1.1 million in Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, according to a 1987
estimate made for the American Jewish Committee. Florida has about
half of the South's Jewish population, mostly in the southern part
of the state.
   The committee counts about 5.9 million Jews throughout the
United States.
   Jews historically were scattered in rural communities across the
region, and their presence remains strongest in medium-sized cities
and small towns through active congregations like B'nai Shalom in
tiny Blountville, Tenn.
   ``I have to come in for a cultural injection now and then
because I miss it,'' said Sharon Moskowitz, 36, a New York native
who with her husband and two children travels from Marion, Va., to
Blountville most Friday nights to attend services at B'nai Shalom.
   They are the only Jews in Marion, a town of about 7,000 in
southwestern Virginia near the northeastern Tennessee border.
   ``I used to be super, super anxious about it,'' Ms. Moskowitz
said of rearing her 6-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter in a
non-Jewish town. ``My son goes to camp in Long Island and he was
the only one who knew the Hebrew songs at the camp. In the North,
they live it so they don't have to learn it. We can't take it for
granted.''
   Judy Peiser, who still lives in her hometown of Memphis, Tenn.,
and heads the Center for Southern Folklore there, said, ``I'm
always explaining the Jewish culture. It's a constant learning
process for them (non-Jewish Southerners) and a teaching process
for Jews. You've got to know the answers.''
   Jews first ventured to the South from the Northeast or took more
direct routes to flee unfriendly European and Spanish homelands via
ocean ports in Galveston, Texas, Charleston, S.C., and other
Southern cities.
   The first arrivals were refugees of the fading Spanish
Inquisition who dived early into the American melting pot and
enthusiastically adopted the aristocratic Southern culture.
   The Spanish-speaking Jews were followed in the early- to
mid-1800s by Jews from Germany who set out on foot as peddlers,
saved enough money to buy horses, then wagons and later opened
shops. They were followed by a huge wave of East European
immigrants who were more outwardly religious and who disdained the
assimilationist tendencies of the earlier arrivals.
   Jews often took prominent places in their new Southern
hometowns, and the region today lacks a distinct blue-collar Jewish
class.
   ``Jews had to walk a very tight line,'' said Abraham Peck,
administrative director of the American Jewish Archives at Hebrew
Union College in Cincinnati. ``It's really an amazing thing that
they were able to live in two worlds, one a world of (their own)
religious liberalism and the other a closed-off, segregated
society.''
   American Judaism's most liberal faction, Reform Judaism, was
born in the South, where Jews were more economically dependent on
their non-Jewish neighbors _ black and white.
   Carolyn Lipson-Walker, whose doctoral dissertation is titled
``Shalom Y'all: The Folklore and Culture of Southern Jews,'' said
Southern Jews have fused their social and religious practices to
produce a dual culture.
   Among the examples her research turned up:
   _ A cookbook put together by the women of a synagogue in Baton
Rouge, La., includes a recipe for matzoh ball gumbo.
   _ A synagogue in Brookhaven, Miss., for years held a high holy
day shrimp fry, even though traditional Jewish dietary laws ban
shellfish.
   _ A Jewish family in Texas often barbecued matzoh on their
backyard grill.
   _ A Nashville, Tenn., octogenarian recalled a temple celebration
marked by the arrival of ``Hanukkah Claus on reindeer.''
   A Jewish man from Savannah, Ga., explained he never thought of
marrying outside of his faith. Asked what he meant, Ms.
Lipson-Walker said he replied, ``Well, Southern Jews, of course.''
   Ethnic differences were discouraged in the South _ she remembers
being chided as a child in Tuscaloosa, Ala., for using Yiddish
words _ but the practice of religion was encouraged, Ms.
Lipson-Walker said.
   Jews in the South, both natives and transplants, are affiliated
with synagogues and other Jewish organizations more than Jews
living elsewhere, and Jews in the South often travel hundreds of
miles to seek Jewish contact for themselves and their children, her
research concluded.
   ``Until recently, even the Conservative and Orthodox Jews in the
South were less traditional than their Northern Jewish
counterparts,'' Ms. Lipson-Walker wrote. ```What will the goyim
(non-Jews) think?' takes on a great significance in the relatively
homogeneous South.''
   The South has its notorious examples of violent anti-Semitism,
including the Ku Klux Klan and the Atlanta lynching of Leo Frank
for the murder of a 14-year-old pencil factory worker in 1913. But
Gail Gans, a researcher in New York for the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith, said the region no longer stands out as a bastion
of discrimination and hatred against Jews.
   ``It has historically, of course,'' she said.
   Evans, Peck and other researchers agreed the post-Civil War
period was among the worst for anti-Semitism in the South.
   A notable example was the scapegoating of Judah P. Benjamin, a
New Orleans lawyer who served as attorney general, secretary of war
and secretary of state under Jefferson Davis. Many blamed him for
the Confederacy's defeat, while others falsely accused him of
involvement in Abraham Lincoln's assassination, Evans said.
Benjamin fled in disguise to England.
   ``During the 1870s and through the beginning of the 20th
century, anti-Semitism in the South, in all its manifestations ...
were the actions of powerless men reaching out to compensate for
their economic distress,'' Peck wrote in a paper on Southern Jewry.
   Blacks served as a lightning rod, absorbing expressions of bias
that might otherwise have been directed at Jews in the South, where
anti-Semitism was aimed more ``against a generalized stereotype of
the Jew,'' said Joseph Cohen, a Tennessean who founded the Jewish
Studies Program at Tulane University.
   ``The blacks and the Catholics had the worst time of it and they
were always a buffer,'' he said.
   As for Southern Jews, their years of being neighbors and local
merchants seemed to help defuse potential trouble. Said Cohen:
``There was a big difference between the stereotypical Jew and Sam
who ran the store.''

<HEAD>China's Presence in Hong Kong is Everywhere _ and Expanding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High above Hong Kong's imposing skyline, the
final girders are swinging into place atop the Bank of China's
striking prism-shaped building.
   The 70-story glass-and-steel building, to be the local
headquarters of mainland China's official bank, is a
none-too-subtle symbol of China's unrivaled influence and growing
activity in this British colony which reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.
   Communist China's soaring presence is a result of
market-oriented economic reforms championed by Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping in Beijing and the part of the agreement with Britain that
says Hong Kong can keep its capitalist system for 50 years after
1997.
   Chinese officials of various ranks are invading Hong Kong for a
crash course in capitalism and to secure money-making deals. The
big Chinese companies are wheeling and dealing in Hong Kong's
high-flying property market, investing in major construction
projects and even buying large blocks of local stock.
   Chinese diplomats are busy too.
   Xu Jiatun, China's top diplomat in Hong Kong, shows up at pop
concerts and cocktail parties. He heads the local branch of China's
official Xinhua News Agency but is viewed by many as the colony's
shadow government.
   Xu's main task is to promote stability and prosperity in Hong
Kong, and he is full of kind words for its capitalist society.
   ``We have some comrades who always fear capitalism, but in fact
they don't understand that the modern capitalist system is a great
creation of human civilization,'' he has told reporters.
   No official figures are available to show how many China-backed
companies are in Hong Kong, but estimates run into the thousands.
China is widely regarded as the largest foreign investor in Hong
Kong, with estimates ranging from $6 billion to $8 billion.
   The investments include department stores, factories,
supermarkets and real estate. Much of the activity is financed by
the 14-member Bank of China group, which saw profits rise by 30
percent to 60 percent in 1987, according to the Capital Information
Services financial research firm.
   China's property purchases in Hong Kong totaled about $1 billion
last year, exceeded only by Japanese and local investors, according
to William Kwan of Chesterton Petty, an international property
consulting company. China snatched up hotels, office buildings and
residential high-rises.
   ``They have to support the political confidence of people'' in
the years before 1997, Kwan said, noting that the injection of
Chinese capital creates demand and raises real estate prices.
   Some deals reflect the need for more space by expanding Chinese
companies while other deals are strictly to make money.
   China International Trust and Investment Corp., for example,
bought an office building near the central business district for
about $45 million in May 1987 and then sold it to Japanese
interests five months later for a 35 percent profit, according to
Chesterton Petty.
   Other Chinese moves that have turned heads in Hong Kong include:
   _Bailouts of financially troubled Hong Kong banks and a pledge
by the Bank of China of the equivalent in Hong Kong dollars of $128
million to save the colony's teetering futures exchange after the
global stock market crash in October.
   _The purchase by CITIC, which is China's premier international
investment company, of 12.5 percent of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.,
the territory's profitable flag carrier.
   _Participation of three Chinese companies in three competing
consortia bidding for a multimillion-dollar tunnel project through
the suburban New Territories.
   Matching China's flurry of economic activity in Hong Kong has
been its expanded political work.
   From the Xinhua headquarters across the street from the Happy
Valley race track, a staff of several hundred stay in touch with
nearly every sector of society.
   Hong Kong's Chinese-language Wide Angle magazine reported that
the news agency has separate departments responsible for keeping in
touch with the Hong Kong government, students, grass-root
organizations and the colony's elite.
   Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a political science lecturer at Chinese
University of Hong Kong, says China's plan to win over local
residents is ``a longtime process of befriending us, of co-opting
us, so when the Chinese come (in 1997) there's a very good chance
of us being immobilized or at least neutralized.''
   One group that China has successfully cultivated is the power
elite, who believe toeing the Beijing line is the best way to keep
their businesses healthy after 1997.
   China also can count on several local organizations to support
its policies here.
   For example, the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, which
represents about 170,000 workers, mobilized its members last year
to support China's opposition to general legislative elections in

   This, along with the colonial government's decision to delay
elections until 1991, has led some local activists to believe China
already is calling the shots in Hong Kong.

<HEAD>Saved from Erosion: 450 Million Tons of Topsoil</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for Weekly Farm</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old effort to combat erosion wearing
away 3 billion tons of topsoil a year in the Farm Belt is beginning
to produce results, conservationists and farm lawmakers say.
   ``It is saving a half a billion tons of soil from erosion each
year,'' says Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt. ``It has helped the farmer by stabilizing farm income and
land values. It has helped the public by reducing pollution and
lowering the cost of farm programs.''
   The Conservation Reserve Program, created under wide-ranging
1985 farm legislation, marked a sharp departure from soil erosion
programs in the past.
   Rather than taking the traditional, year-to-year approach, it
envisions long-term idling of huge amounts of highly erodible land.
   Some 25 million highly erodible farm acres have been placed in
the Conservation Reserve thus far. The government is paying rent to
keep the land out of cultivation except for trees and cover crops
that halt erosion.
   The aim is to place 45 million such acres into the reserve by
1990.
   Farmers are banned under the program from using land placed in
reserve for grazing and production of hay or row crops, such as
corn and soybeans, that wear away highly erodible soil.
   Preliminary indications cited by conservationists are that the
program has reduced erosion by 450 million to 500 million tons of
soil a year.
   The government estimated annual erosion at three billion tons in
1985 when the program was approved.
   ``We're saving 10 times more soil than we were in the previous
programs,'' says Bob Gray, a policy consultant to the American
Farmland Trust, a Washington group that spearheaded the campaign
for the reserve.
   Rental payments are admittedly costly to the government but the
program has thus far escaped the type of criticism that has been
focused on some of the crop subsidy provisions of the 1985 law.
   One reason may be that the program limits crop production and
thus is a factor in holding down surpluses that can cause an
explosion of federal payments under price and income support
programs as well as storage costs.
   Moreover, there are costs to the farmer in placing the land in
reserve.
   ``This is not just money coming to the farmer to put in the bank
or go on a holiday with it,'' says House Agriculture Committee
Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas. ``There is a cost to
preserve the land, or just to plant a vegetative cover.''
   Rents range from $45 to $50 an acre.
   One problem that has cropped up, however, is that rents have
been high enough to drive up the going rate for land in some parts
of the country.
   ``This is a big problem and a big program,'' says
conservationist Ken Cook, a major architect of the program. ``There
are going to be some mistakes and misfits ... But this is a
gigantic stride away from what we had before.''
   Not everyone views the program with equal enthusiasm. Rather
than blasting it, however, potential critics tend to say it has
done some good but could benefit from modifications.
   Pierre Crosson, a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, a
Washington-based, non-profit research group, says it is still to
soon to make ``really firm judgements as to precisely what the
payoff of the program is.''
   ``We don't know enough about what the various benefits are to be
very conclusive about that sort of thing,'' he says.
   Crosson is finishing a report that he says will show the program
has caused little improvement of water quality because most of the
land in the reserve contributes little to the sedimentation that
causes water quality problems.
   Agricultural runoff has been a major contributor to water
problems. A 1985 report from the Conservation Foundation estimated
the off-farm costs of soil erosion at perhaps $6.1 billion a year
and possibly even as high as $13 billion.
   One oft-cited cost is the Army Corps of Engineers dredging of
reservoirs that have become filled with silt.
   Agricultural runoff that finds its way down the Mississippi to
the Gulf of Mexico is also blamed for much of the nagging problem
of seafood contamination.
   Still, water quality improvement is a secondary objective of the
program. The main goal is cutting back on soil erosion.
   ``From a conservation standpoint, the Conservation Reserve
Program is a distinct improvment over earlier USDA land
conservation programs,'' Crosson says. ``That doesn't mean that it
couldn't be done still better.''
   Some of the most serious erosion problems are focused in the
High Plains region reaching from eastern Montana to Colorado and
Nebraska and to parts of Iowa, Missouri and Kansas.
   The problem intensified in the 1970s when agricultural exports _
and farming _ were expanding dramatically.
   ``We're talking about thin and fragile soils that in many cases
were not meant to be farmed,'' says Sierra Club lobbyist Daniel
Weiss. ``They were plowed out in the 1970s to make a quick buck.''

   The annexation of Korea in 1910, the ``Rape of
Nanking'' in 1937, the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941: all
these are accepted in standard Western histories as aggressions of
Japanese militarism in the first half of the 20th century. But in
today's economically powerful Japan, nationalistic right-wingers
maintain that was not the way it was. Here is a report on their
efforts to revise history.

   A move that seeks to justify Japan's militaristic
past is gaining ground in conservative governing circles.
   In contrast with trends in the Soviet Union and Austria toward
greater criticism of the records of their pasts under Stalinism and
Nazism, some Japanese conservatives are challenging the generally
accepted judgment that Japan was an aggressor before and during
World War II.
   Right-wing opinions have cropped up repeatedly in high places as
Japan's economic prosperity surged in the 1980s, raising Japanese
pride and diluting some of the guilt the country felt after its
defeat in war.
   Most recently, the director general of the national land agency,
Seisuke Okuno, set off an international furor by saying that Japan
was not an aggressor in World War II and that the country ``fought
to protect itself at a time when the white race had turned Asia
into a colony.''
   The 75-year-old Okuno, who is regarded as the third most
prominent member of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's Cabinet, was
forced to resign May 19, but not before his viewpoint had been
backed by 41 parliamentarians of the governing Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP).
   ``We fully support Mr. Okuno's remarks and his historical
interpretation,'' the right-wingers said in a statement.
   They have organized themselves within the party, which has been
in power nearly four decades, as the Fellow Thinkers Council on
Fundamental National Issues, headed by Shizuka Kamei.
   ``There are many other people inside and outside the LDP who
support our nationalistic move to re-evaluate the past and
traditional values,'' Kamei said in an interview. ``They just don't
openly express their sentiment.''
   The scope of the movement is hard to judge. Kamei's right-wing
group had 18 members when it started two years ago and has grown to
41, but that's still a small minority of the LDP's 445
representatives in the two houses of Parliament.
   Japan does not have broad-based opinion surveys that probe
nationalistic sentiments or ask whether people believe the country
was an aggressor five or six decades ago. But as pride in the
country's economic accomplishments grows, commentators see a
gradual change in the postwar attitudes of great guilt for wartime
actions.
   ``Nationalism now seems to be growing among the Japanese, who
are eager to see their country exercise a political voice becoming
of its economic stature,'' The Japan Times commented in an
editorial on Okuno's remarks.
   ``Our belief is that Japan must pursue its national interests
with a righteous historical perspective. Otherwise, it will face
formidable resistance _ surely, an unwise approach on the part of
Japan.''
   Okuno was the second official forced to leave the Cabinet in two
years for challenging the generally accepted historical record.
   Education Minister Masayuki Fujio was fired in 1986 by Yasuhiro
Nakasone, then prime minister, after he angered South and North
Korea by writing in a magazine article that Korea was partly
responsible for its annexation by Japan in 1910.
   The Education Ministry was the center of controversy in 1980
after it forced the noted Japanese historian Saburo Ienaga to
delete from a high school textbook his whole reference to the
Imperial Army's notorious 731 Unit in China. Ienaga alleged that
the unit conducted experiments on about 3,000 American, Chinese and
Soviet prisoners of war and others, using typhus, cholera and
bubonic plague germs.
   According to Yasushi Mitarai, director of the Education
Ministry's Textbook Administration Division, the ministry still
maintains that not enough evidence is available to prove the
allegation.
   In 1981 and 1982, the Education Ministry asked Ienaga and other
historians to revise and soften the wartime record, proposing to
describe Japan's invasion of China as an ``advance,'' not as
``aggression,'' as previous textbooks did; to delete mention of the
``Rape of Nanking'' in China in 1937; and to describe the forcible
transfer of Koreans to Japan as ``an implementation of the national
mobilization order to the Koreans.''
   China claims that more than 300,000 people, mainly civilians,
were killed or raped after Nanking, then China's capital, fell to
four Japanese divisions in December 1937. The South Korean
government says more than 1 million Koreans were dragooned to do
forced labor in Japan during World War II.
   The Education Ministry's move drew sharp protests from Asian
countries, and Japan settled a dispute with China and South Korea
by promising to amend controversial passages.

   President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev may have
squared off in private during their fourth summit, but in public,
everywhere from the ballroom to the Bolshoi, they looked like a
pair of superpower pals.
   Outside the Kremlin, Reagan flung his arm over Gorbachev's
shoulder after one closed-door meeting. At the ballet, Gorbachev
pulled his chair closer to Reagan's so they could share small-talk.
They left the theater box with their arms at each other's waists.
   The high-level chumminess is seen as a dramatic symbol of the
end of Cold War politics. But does it have any real impact on
Soviet-American negotiations?
   ``It would be simplistic to think these two men can ramrod
through an arms agreement on their own,'' one American official
close to the talks said privately. ``On the other hand, they can
tell their negotiators to cut through the baloney which sometimes
can be the death of an accord.''
   Unlike the iciness that divides Nancy Reagan and Raisa
Gorbachev, Reagan and Gorbachev share a rapport that, even when
tempered by wariness, apparently helps steer them through
differences and allows them to keep talking.
   Reagan indicated Friday that he sees the Soviet leader as a man
he can talk to. ``My personal impression of Mr. Gorbachev is that
he is a serious man seeking serious reform,'' the president said in
London.
   Earlier, in a warm farewell speech at the Kremlin's St. George's
Hall, Reagan told the Gorbachevs: ``We think of you as friends.''
   Whether or not Gorbachev will strike up such a relationship with
the man who succeeds Reagan in January 1989 remains to be seen.
That uncertainty has fueled speculation that a fifth summit might
be held before Reagan leaves office.
   The growing cordiality between the two leaders appears to be
based in part on each man's ability to be casually charming and
personable.
   Gorbachev demonstrated his charisma during his news conference.
He interrupted his own statement about Soviet-American relations
when he noticed an electronic system which provided a simultaneous
translation of his remarks was not working in one row.
   In a remarkable performance for a Soviet leader, a smiling,
gesturing Gorbachev orchestrated a solution, asking Russian
speakers to change places with the foreign journalists.
   The burgeoning friendship between Reagan and Gorbachev also
reflects a deepening understanding of each others' countries, which
analysts hail as an important development.
   Reagan, apparently with some surprise, told a group of Soviet
students they reminded him of American university students back
home. And although he met with Soviet dissidents during his
five-day visit, Reagan has become progressively less preachy about
human rights issues during his four summits with Gorbachev.
   ``There was more and more politics, and less rhetoric, in this
summit,'' Gorbachev said Friday in remarks carried by Soviet media.
   For his part, the general secretary has acknowledged that the
Soviets have much to learn about the Americans.
   ``The American administration does not have an understanding of
the real situation regarding human rights,'' Gorbachev said
Wednesday at his unprecedented news conference.
   But he quickly added: ``Probably we too do not have a clear
understanding of the American situation in this sphere of life.''
   This improved familiarity with each other's cultures, as well as
the recognition that there is more to learn, is probably the
greatest contribution the Reagan-Gorbachev friendship has made to
superpower relations.
   ``When Americans see a president with the hardline political
views of Reagan embracing the Soviet leader, it is an image that
carries some weight, in political circles as well as in private
homes,'' the U.S. official said.
   ``All of a sudden, it has become all right to be a diehard
capitalist and still have a communist friend,'' he said. ``And that
is a change that will outlast Reagan's term.''

   Consumers continued to spend at a slow pace in May, the nation's
largest general retailers reported, and Wall Street analysts said
the slump could continue through much of the summer.
   High installment debt, an aversion to higher prices and boredom
with current fashions _ the same factors that have kept consumers
cautious for months _ contributed to the lackluster May performance
and were exacerbated by the unusually cool spring, analysts said
Thursday.

   Financier Carl C. Icahn sought to turn up the
heat in his fight with Texaco Inc., calling together securities
analysts to try to convince them he has the means _ and the will _
to follow through on his takeover bid.
   Icahn offered last week to buy the 86.2 percent of the company's
stock he does not already own for $60 a share, or $12.4 billion.
The bid put a total value on Texaco's 207 million shares of $14.6
billion.
   Texaco's directors rejected the offer Friday, prompting Icahn,
the company's largest shareholder, to go through with his threat to
wage a proxy fight for five seats on the oil giant's board.

   The nation's largest general retailers reported their sales
remained slack in May as consumers continued to hold tight to their
purse strings.
   ``Retail sales have been in a recession since the middle of last
year, and they still are,'' Linda Kristiansen, a retail industry
analyst with the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
Thursday after the retailers issued their monthly sales reports.
   High installment debt, an aversion to higher prices and boredom
with current fashions _ the same factors that have kept consumers
cautious for months _ contributed to the lackluster May performance
and were exacerbated by the unusually cool spring, analysts said.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co., described
last month's sales as ``in line with or slightly below
conservatively budgeted expectations.''
   Feiner said storeowners have responded to the continued sales
slump by cutting back their inventories.
   He warned this could result in fewer orders to manufacturers and
``could potentially back up into the rest of the economy.''
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the gross
national product, is an important barometer of the economy's health.
   Analysts say June sales results could show a pickup if the
warmer weather that arrived at the end of May holds up, but a major
turnaround is not expected for several months.
   ``The next chance for a decent sales gain will be in August with
the back-to-school'' merchandise, said Monroe Greenstein, an
analyst with Bear Stearns & Co.
   Many retailers said their May sales were only marginally higher
or down from levels of a year ago.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said its
overall sales rose 5.1 percent when compared with May 1987, while
sales for the first 17 weeks of the fiscal year rose 3.5 percent
over last year. But sales at stores open at least a year, known as
same-store sales in the industry, rose only 0.2 percent last month
and 1.1 percent so far this year.
   Analysts pay closer attention to same-store sales because they
provide a more accurate picture of a retailer's performance.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 6 percent last month
and 4.8 percent so far this year. Same-store sales were up 2.3
percent for May and 1.7 percent for the year-to-date.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales gained 27 percent
last month and 31 percent so far this year. Same-store sales rose 8
percent for May and 12 percent year-to-date.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., which emphasizes its fashion lines, said
its overall sales fell 1.2 percent last month but were up 2.4
percent so far this year. Penney's same-store sales declined 1.4
percent in May and rose 1.5 percent for the first 17 weeks.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall sales rose 17.6 percent in
May and 18.1 percent so far this year. Same-store sales were up 1.7
percent last month and 1.5 percent year-to-date.
   May Department Stores Co. reported a 17.8 percent overall
increase in May and a 6.5 percent rise year-to-date. Same-store
sales were up 1.3 percent last month but down 0.3 percent during
the first 17 weeks. The company's May results included sales from
the newly acquired Foley's and Filene's divisions.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. reported a 14.2 percent gain in May and a
12.2 percent increase so far this year.
   Montgomery Ward & Co. said its overall sales rose 3.7 percent
last month and 3 percent for the year-to-date. Same-store sales
edged up 0.9 percent in May and 0.3 percent so far this year.
   The numbers reported Thursday were for general merchandise and
apparel retailers and do not reflect sales of auto dealers or
supermarkets.

   Burlington Northern Inc., owner of the nation's
largest railroad, has concluded that oil and trains don't mix _ at
least not in the same company.
   The Seattle-based conglomerate announced a major restructuring
Thursday that includes separating non-transportation operations
into a subsidiary that eventually will be spun off as a separate
company.
   For the time being, though, Burlington Northern said it is
seeking to sell to the public a 13 percent stake in its recently
formed Burlington Resources Inc. and raise around $500 million for
possible future expansion.
   The unit contains Burlington Northern's energy, natural resource
and real estate operations.
   ``The objective here is to enhance shareholder value by creating
two very viable companies _ one in transportation and one in
resources,'' Chairman Richard M. Bressler said at a meeting with
financial analysts after Thursday's announcement.
   ``We think the marketplace has penalized our company because we
are a conglomerate,'' he said.
   Trading on Wall Street appeared to confirm some of those
concerns. Burlington Northern's stock, which rose as much as $4.12{
by midday Thursday, closed up $1.75 a share to $69.12{ in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The stock had risen before the announcement on speculation
Burlington Northern was planning to sell its natural gas pipeline
company or other assets.
   George Morris, an analyst with the investment firm Prescott Ball
& Turben Inc., said separating Burlington Northern's transportation
operations from the others was a move in the right direction.
   ``They're two distinctively different businesses _ the railroad
and the natural resources,'' Morris said. ``When you complicate
businesses, you have a multitude of influences as opposed to a
purer play. It confuses shareholders and distracts from the
industry.''
   For example, he said, when energy prices rise, that usually
hurts the company's transportation unit but boosts the natural
resource operations.
   The company said about 60 percent of its operating income comes
from transportation operations, with the remainder from natural
resources.
   Bressler said the company's restructuring was a ``two-step
process.''
   The first objective is to establish a market for the newly
created Burlington Resources stock by issuing a minority stake to
the public, then break off the unit into a separate publicly owned
company.
   Burlington Northern said it filed a registration statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public
offering of 20 million shares of common stock. It said the
Burlington Resources stock is expected to be priced between $25 and
$28 a share, putting a value on the offering between $500 million
and $560 million.
   When the offering is completed, probably in about a month,
Burlington Northern said it would retain 130 million shares in
Burlington Resources, or 87 percent of the subsidiary's stock.
   The parent company said it hoped to spin off its stake to
Burlington Northern's shareholders by the end of the year or early
next year. The Internal Revenue Service is expected to rule on the
tax consequences of the move in December.
   Bressler said the proceeds from the public sale would be used
for either lowering the company's debt, increasing its dividend or
making acquisitions. He said the company is looking at oil and gas
properties currently up for sale by Tenneco Inc.
   Burlington Northern's main subsidiary, Burlington Northern
Railroad Co., has 28,000 miles of track stretching from the Pacific
Northwest to the Gulf of Mexico, making it the nation's largest
railroad system.
   Burlington Resources includes Meridian Oil Inc., an independent
oil and gas producer, and El Paso Natural Gas Co., owner and
operator of a 22,000-mile interstate natural gas transmission
system.
   It also includes Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., a timber and forest
products company; Meridien Minerals Co., a coal and minerals
development and production cpompany; and Glacier Park Co., which is
involved in real estate management, sale and development.

<HEAD>Icahn Says He Expects No Problem Raising Money For Texaco Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN C. GIVEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover specialist Carl C. Icahn, whose
$60-per-share bid for Texaco Inc. has met a heavy dose of
skepticism on Wall Street, says he will have little problem raising
the necesary cash to finance the buyout.
   Meeting with securities analysts Thursday, Icahn said he would
have to borrow $8.86 billion to complete his offer, made last week,
to buy the 86.2 percent of the company's stock he does not already
own for $12.4 billion. The bid put a total value on Texaco's 207
million shares of $14.6 billion.
   To complete the deal, Icahn said he would sell two subsidiaries
_ Texaco Canada Inc. and the company's 50 percent interest in
Caltex, among other provisions.
   He then would borrow against the $2.98 billion cash flow
expected to be generated this year to obtain the remainder, Icahn
said.
   Texaco later scoffed at the plan, calling Icahn's offer ``still
illusory'' and dismissing the details he provided as ``sketchy,
sloppy and wrong.''
   Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, launched a proxy fight for
five of the company's 14 board seats on Friday, after the board
rejected his offer.
   He said he would have dropped the bid if Texaco had put it to a
shareholder vote at the company's annual meeting later this month.
   If his five-man slate wins, Icahn said Thursday he is confident
he would be able to persuade the board to sanction such a vote.
   As far as financing is concerned, ``We've had several banks tell
us we would have no trouble raising that on the basis that (the
takeover would be) on a friendly basis,'' Icahn said.
   On hostile terms, however, ``it would be just about impossible''
because of certain statutory requirements, he added.
   Texaco said in a statement issued from its White Plains, N.Y.,
headquarters that Icahn's $8.86 billion figure ``simply wished away
or ignored more than $5 billion in debt and other obligations he
would also have to immediately finance.
   ``Morgan Stanley & Co., our financial advisor, has informed
Texaco that Icahn's plan is simply not financable in their
opinion,'' the statement added.
   Securities analysts and the stock market have dimissed the offer
as a ploy, either to lure other bidders into the ring, or to
encourage Texaco's management to buy his shares or help him sell
them to a third party.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Texaco stock has traded just
above $50 a share _ far below the $60 Icahn proposed. In nationwide
trading Thursday, it closed at $50.62{ a share, down $1.75.
   Icahn acknowledged that his own $60-per-share price was
``cheap,'' saying: ``If it were out for a vote, there's no doubt in
my mind it would go higher, because there would be an auction.''
   Asked what price he believed would be fair, Icahn replied: ``I'm
not going to go into that.''
   From the start, Texaco officials questioned whether Icahn could
arrange financing for the deal, despite his pledge to put up $100
million that would be forfeited to the company if he failed to come
up with the financing in time for Texaco's annual meeting June 17
in Tulsa, Okla.
   Icahn stipulated, however, that the $100 million would not be
forfeited if another party topped his offer or if the Internal
Revenue Service failed to assent to the plan.
   On Thursday, he said his message to shareholders was simple:
``Even if you don't like me, if you vote for me, I'm going to get
you $60.'' And, he added, ``If I can't get you your $60, I'll
resign and (Texaco) will get its $100 million.''
   If his slate loses, Icahn said he would ``go away,'' and sell
his shares ``in a secondary offer of some such thing.''
   On another matter, Icahn also declined to comment on the
interest in Texaco of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., an investment
banking firm with a long record for conducting takeovers.
   In March Kohlberg said it bought 4.9 percent of Texaco's stock
and asked permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to
up that stake to 15 percent.
   Icahn told reporters that he had spoken to Henry Kravis but
stressed they were not collaborating.
   ``But that's not to say we have any deals with Henry Kravis, and
we don't. We absolutely don't,'' he added.
   Icahn paid about $1.2 billion in building his Texaco stake,
which is now worth about $1.8 billion.
   The amount he already has paid and the $12.4 billion he is
offering for the remaining Texaco shares would put his total cost
for acquiring the company at $13.6 billion _ the biggest sum ever
paid in a corporate buyout.
   The biggest deal so far was the $13.4 billion acquisition of
Gulf Corp. by Standard Oil Co. of California, now Chevron Corp., in
1984.

<HEAD>Aspirin Sales Rose Immediately After Heart Attack Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aspirin sales got a short-lived lift earlier
this year after the release of a study on aspirin and first heart
attacks, figures from a leading market research firm indicate.
   Industry analysts say that should come as no surprise. The
report attracted a lot of media attention, but just how many
100-tablet bottles of the stuff does somebody need if he takes one
aspirin every other day?
   They also note that aspirin makers agreed not to use the results
of the study to promote their product until the government
investigates the data further.
   Analysts say the long-term sales outlook for aspirin should
brighten, however, if government studies support new ways to use
the painkiller.
   Aspirin sales at the nation's larger food stores jumped to about
190 million tablets in the first week in February, up 41 percent
from unit sales of about 135 million in the same week in 1987,
according to figures from Nielsen Marketing Research, based in
Northbroook, Ill.
   But unit sales at those outlets then fell steadily over the next
several weeks and by mid-March were back to levels roughly matching
that of a year earlier, Nielsen said.
   From mid-March through the last week in April, the most recent
week for which figures were made available, Nielsen said unit sales
ran between 135 million and 140 million tablets a week, about the
same as a year earlier.
   The Nielsen numbers are for supermarkets with more than $4
million in sales a year and do not include sales at drug and mass
merchandise stores.
   Since 1985 it has been known that aspirin reduces the risk of
second heart attacks and certain kinds of heart pain, and aspirin
makers have pointed that out in their advertising.
   But on Jan. 28, the New England Journal of Medicine published a
study that indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of
non-fatal, first heart attacks by 47 percent in 11,000 male
physicians over a 5-year period, compared with 11,000 who took a
non-aspirin substitute.
   The makers of the aspirin products Bayer, Bufferin and Anacin
each refused to discuss how the news of the study affected either
their own or segment-wide sales.
   Travis Whitlow, promotion manager for Nielsen, said one
explanation for the brief sales surge Nielsen detected at food
stores was that some people who heard about the report might have
bought a bottle of aspirin but would not need another for three to
six months.
   The Food and Drug Administration has persuaded aspirin makers to
refrain from advertising claims about aspirin and first heart
attacks until the government analyzes data from the study further.
   The agency said today in a commentary appearing in the Journal
of the American Medical Association that doctors should be cautious
in prescribing aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more
research supports its value.
   It said taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase
some people's chances of dying of other things, especially
hemorrhagic strokes.
   David Saks, a pharmaceutical industry analyst who runs Saks
Health Care Investment Advisory, a consulting firm in River Vale,
N.J., said aspirin makers have spent more time trying to educate
doctors about the possible uses of aspirin in recent years.
   He said he sees signs that the approach is starting to pay off,
and that a halt may be near in the decade-old erosion of aspirin's
share of the analgesic market by non-aspirin products.
   ``There may have been some incremental growth (due to the latest
study), but I don't think the average person is paying much
attention to it,'' Saks said.
   He said if aspirin makers can make doctors pay attention,
however, they could see some sales growth ahead as they recommend
aspirin for patients.

   South Korea's consumer prices rose 0.5
percent in May compared with the previous month and and 6.5 percent
from a year ago, the Economic Planning Board reported Friday.
   The board also said wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent last month
from April and 1.9 percent from May 1987.
   The increases, which followed declines in April, were attributed
partly to hikes in wages, cooking coal and housing rentals.
   The government is attempting to keep the annual consumer and
wholesale price inflation to 4.5 percent and 3 percent respectively.

   The dollar reversed course and fell against all
major foreign currencies in European trading today.
   Gold bullion rose in active trading.
   The dollar opened strong in Tokyo, but came under pressure from
profit-taking before the European opening, traders said.
   At midmorning, the U.S. unit was losing ground against all major
currencies, although markets had calmed from the previous day's
sharp swings.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
were: 1.7223 West German marks, down from 1.7295; 1.4345 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4425; 5.8275 French francs, down from 5.8502;
1.9343 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9413; 1,282.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,286.75; and 1.2303 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2325.
   The British pound edged up to $1.8005 from late Thursday's rate
of $1.7967. Major British banks raised their base lending rates by
half point Friday to 8 percent, but analysts said sterling still
appeared vulnerable.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 126.11 Japanese yen, up from
125.68 yen. But in later London trading today, the dollar slipped
back to 125.70 yen.
   Bullion prices, boosted by a rally in the commodities market,
jumped after a bout of profit-taking ran out of steam.
   London's main bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $464.85 a troy ounce, up from $454.30.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $464.50, up from $453.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $463.71, up
from $455.38.
   Silver bullion rose sharply in London, trading at a bid of $7.24
a troy ounce, up from $6.73.

   Reflecting strong gains in New York and London, the
U.S. dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen in Tokyo today,
while share prices dipped for the first time in a week.
   The dollar closed the week at 126.11 yen, up 0.43 yen from its
125.68-yen finish Thursday. It opened the day's trading at 126.07
and changed hands between 126-126.25 yen throughout the day.
   The dollar last closed on the 126-yen level on April 14, when it
finished at 126.10 yen. The next day, the currency tumbled to
124.13 yen.
   Exchange dealers said the dollar opened too strong today and
dropped briefly in early trading but stabilized in the late morning
and afternoon sessions.
   ``Investors saw the opening level as being too high and sold the
dollar in profit-taking,'' said a dealer at a U.S. bank. ``But the
dollar is basically bullish, and it bounced back up,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Dealers said Japanese trust banks, which sold as much as $1
billion at the 126.30-126.40-yen level, contributed to keeping the
currency at a higher level.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, the Nikkei Stock Average
of 225 selected issues lost 47.82 points, or 0.17 percent, from
Thursday's close to finish the day at 27,821.54. The loss snapped a
four-day winning streak in which the main market barometer had
gained a total 646.26 points.
   ``The market resisted unfavorable conditions such as higher
requirements for margin trading, profit-taking and concern over
inflation in the U.S. during the morning session,'' said a broker
at a major securities firm. ``But it could not maintain the current
level and dropped down a little in the afternoon,'' he added,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced Thursday it was raising its
margin requirement from 60 percent to 70 percent effective today.
   Volume traded on the exchange's first section was a strong 2
billion shares.

   Prices on the London Stock Exchange were slighty
higher in aimless trading at midday Friday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was 4.4
points, or 0.24 percent, higher at 1,814.7 at 12:30 p.m. local time.
   Trading volume was a moderate 359.6 million shares, compared
with 274.3 million shares at the same time Thursday.
   Dealers said the market had little direction with only selected
stocks finding favor with market players.
   International stocks were aided by the British pound's sharp
weakening over the course of the week. Sterling rose overnight, but
this did little to damp investor enthusiasm for dollar-earning
shares, a dealer said.
   At midmorning, the pound was quoted at 1.8005 dollars, up from
late Thursday's rate of 1.7967 dollars.

<HEAD>Turkey Establishes an International Hazelnut Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ZEYNEP ALEMDAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attempt to live up to its reputation
as the world's largest hazelnut producer and exporter, Turkey has
recently established an international union in a joint effort with
some other exporter and importer countries.
   The members of the group include Italy, Spain and West Germany,
both importers and exporters, and the United States and France,
only importers.
   ``Turkey is the leading country in the global hazelnut market,
producing 75 percent of the world's hazelnut crop and having 70
percent of the world's import market,'' Ertugrul Onen, the general
director of the exports department at the Treasury and Foreign
Trade Undersecretary, told The Associated Press.
   But he added that Turkey also wanted to play an active role in
organizing the global hazelnut market.
   Onen said a powerful importers' organization in Hamburg, West
Germany, Waren Verein, had set all the rules in the global hazelnut
market until now. ``But this has got to be changed,'' he added.
   Onen said the union would not be a cartel-like organization.
``That is the reason why we invited importer nations along with the
producers to be the founding members of the union.''
   Onen said the union aimed at improving the workings of the
market, avoiding unnecessary conflicts, preventing delays in
arbitration cases and protecting the rights of both importers and
producers.
   He added that the union would also seek ways to increase
hazelnut production and consumption worldwide.
   The union is expected to start functioning in a few months
following a general convention meeting. Its headquarters will be in
Ankara.
   Turkey's Black Sea coast is the source of the country's hazelnut
production. About two million people make their living from the nut
crop in the region.
   Last year, the country earned 390 million dollars from sale of
hazelnuts, mostly to West Germany, France, Soviet Union, Britain,
Austria, Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands. Hazelnuts are
mostly used in chocolate and other candy.
   The production amounted to 260,000 tons in 1987. This year's
crop is estimated to be 350,000 tons, well over the annual average
amount of 300,000 tons.
   Onen also noted that the crop totally recovered from fallout
from the Chernobyl nuclear accident two years ago.
   Following the disaster, hazelnuts from the eastern part of the
Black Sea coastal area showed radiation levels above the European
Economic Community limit of 600 becerel, a measure of nuclear
contamination.
   The latest measures showed radiation levels under 100 becerel
for the crop, Onen said.

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A planned United Nations fund to shore up
commodity prices is expected next week to come within one vote of
the minimum needed for ratification, a U.N. spokesman said Friday.
   Honduras recently became the 100th nation to ratify the 1980
agreement on a United Nations Common Fund for Commodities and
approval by the Maldives is due next week, spokesman Graham Shanley
said.
   Its ratification would mean that countries accounting for 66.46
percent of initial contributions totaling $470 million have
approved the fund. Two-thirds, 66.67 percent, are needed, so one
more ratification could finally launch the project, Shanley told a
news briefing.
   Hopes were boosted last December when the Soviet Union ratified
the agreement, reached under auspices of the Geneva-based U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development, the main forum for the
north-south dialogue.
   Moscow had signed at last July and is due to pay 5.78 percent of
the fund's starting capital.
   The United States, which would have to contribute 15.7 percent,
signed the pact under the Carter administration but has not given
its ratification.
   The fund would help finance buffer stocks, a device used in
commodity agreements to help steer world market supplies and
thereby prices. Major commodity accords have been negotiated under
the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, including those for
cocoa and natural rubber.
   An additional $265 million in pledges, earmarked for financing
research and development in commodities, will be freed if the fund
enters force.
   The fund was central to an ambitious program launched at a 1976
conference that aimed to promote price stabiliziation for 18 major
commodities, from bauxite to vegetable oils.
   Enthusiasm for such accords has since waned among rich
countries, especially after an agreement regulating world tin
prices went bankrupt three years ago.

<TEXT>
   City officials have asked a U.S. District
Court judge to delay British industrialist Brian Beazer's $1.7
billion takeover of Koppers Co. until they can review the latest
developments in the deal.
   In court papers filed Thursday, the city argued it should be
allowed time to review an agreement to sell the construction
materials and chemicals company before an injunction blocking the
transaction is lifted.
   Beazer won a three-month battle to acquire Koppers this week
when the company agreed to a $61-per-share buyout by BNS Inc., a
company formed by Beazer, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and National
Westminster Bank PLC.
   City officials said they are concerned about the fate of 1,150
employees the company has in the Pittsburgh area. All but 40 of
Koppers' local workforce are attached to chemicals operations
Beazer plans to sell.
   Mayor Sophie Masloff sharply criticized Koppers on Thursday,
saying, ``I think they sold us down the river.... I thought we had
an agreement with them that there wouldn't be a sellout yet, but
apparently they didn't pay any attention to that.''
   Allegheny County Commissioner Tom Foerster has asked the city
and the state to join the county in helping Koppers' employees put
together a plan to buy the company's chemical and allied products
operations from BNS.

<TEXT>
   Bank of New York's hostile takeover bid for
Irving Bank Corp. is being interrupted for 10 days on a federal
judge's orders.
   U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. barred Bank of New
York Thursday from purchasing Irving common stock for 10 days.
   Irving filed suit in federal court last month against Bank of
New York, claiming the unfriendly takeover bid violated federal
securities laws.
   Under its $1.1 billion tender offer, Bank of New York plans to
run Irving as a separate subsidiary, regardless of whether it could
win control of Irving's board. The offer is for $15 in cash and
1.575 shares of its stock for each of Irving's 18.5 million common
shares outstanding.
   Irving claimed Bank of New York failed to notify shareholders of
the financial ramifications of its amended offer and also failed to
disclose the effects of its proposal to operate Irving as a
subsidiary.
   In a 22-page opinion issued after the markets closed Thursday
evening, U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. concluded Bank
of New York ``must issue and disseminate a supplemental prospectus
addressing certain issues.''
   He issued a temporary restraining order that bars purchase of
Irving common stock for 10 days pending additional disclosure.
   ``We have no objection to doing that,'' said John L. Warden, an
attorney for Bank of New York. He said the company was compiling
the necessary information and would have it ready by next Tuesday,
and added that most of it is already public.
   Haight rejected Irving's request for additional disclosure but
directed Irving lawyers to draw up another order that would extend
Bank of New York's offer for six business days after the additional
information is disclosed to shareholders.
   Irving has taken steps to prevent Bank of New York from
proceeding with its tender offer. Last month, it amended its
``poison pill'' so that it would be activated should any unwanted
investor acquire at least 20 percent of Irving shares on the open
market. The poison pill previously would have gone into effect in
the event of a takeover not supported by management.
   Poison pill defenses are designed to discourage takeover bids by
greatly increasing the cost of an acquisition. In Irving's case,
all existing shareholders except Bank of New York would be allowed
to buy Irving shares for half-price once Bank of New York acquired
20 percent of Irving shares.
   Irving has steadfastly rejected Bank of New York takeover
proposals, instead opting for a friendly merger with the state-run
Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's second largest bank.
   The Banca Commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring
plan that includes sale of Irving assets, several cost-cutting
measures and a special $10 dividend. The proposal still needs
regulatory approval.
   Bank of New York closed up 37.5 cents to $32.50 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange before Haight's ruling was
made public, while Irving rose 62.5 cents to $64.

<HEAD>Industry Groups Fail To Reach Agreement On Semiconductor Access</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese electronics industry groups
failed to reach agreement this week on increased foreign access to
the Japanese semiconductor market, the two sides said Friday.
   In meetings in Tokyo, the U.S. Semiconductor Industry
Association and the Electronic Industries Association of Japan
``came close'' to an agreement on increased access for foreign
makers of computer chips, but talks broke down following
disagreement over whether concrete targets should be set for
foreign market share, the Japanese group said.
   Before the meetings, the third set between the two sides, the
Japanese group had presented the U.S. industry group with proposals
for a ``joint action program'' aimed at increasing sales of foreign
semiconductors in Japan.
   The proposals included establishment of long-term relationships
between Japanese semiconductor users and foreign makers, and
increased participation by foreign suppliers in the design stage of
Japanese electronic products, the Japanese group said.
   But the U.S. group insisted on a clearly stated target of sales
promotion for expansion of market shares, the Japanese group said
in a statement.
   Jeanne Locke, director of communications for the U.S.
Semiconductor Industry Association, said the differences focused on
how to address the ``process of market access.''
   ``It started to be apparent we (and the Japanese side) were
talking about two different things,'' she said.
   Locke said U.S. makers wanted to be able to measure progress
through actual improvements in market share.
   The Japanese government has urged Japanese firms to increase
their purchases of foreign-made semiconductor chips, but U.S.
makers say the growth of their sales in the Japanese market is too
slow.
   In April 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan imposed $300 million
in punitive tariffs on Japanese electronic products for Japan's
alleged violation of a 1986 semiconductor agreement. In the pact,
Japan pledged to boost foreign access to the Japanese market and
stop alleged sales of semiconductors by Japanese producers at
unfairly low prices, a practice called ``dumping.''
   A total of $135 million of the trade sanctions have since been
lifted, following a U.S. Commerce Department report that Japanese
makers had stopped dumping semiconductors on world markets.

<HEAD>May Retail Sales Continue Sluggish; Wall Street Slumps</HEAD>
<HEAD>Tops with 8 grafs on May unemployment data; picks up 2nd graf pvs,
Many of ...; fixes credit line.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in May, its
first increase in 20 months, the government said today.
   The 0.2 percentage point increase from a 14-year-low jobless
rate of 5.4 percent was accompanied by an increase of 173,000 in
the number of people listed by the Labor Department as officially
unemployed.
   The department said the labor force, those either holding jobs
or actively looking for them, shrunk by 363,000 to 122.7 million.
   The figures are based on a monthly survey of the nation's
households.
   A separate survey of employer payrolls showed the economy
creating 210,000 jobs in May, but that was down from an average job
growth over the last year of 250,000 a month.
   ``Almost all of the payroll job increase took place in the
service-producing sector,'' said Janet L. Norwood, the commissioner
of labor statistics.
   Ms. Norwood told the congressional Joint Economic Committee that
job growth in business services, which has accounted for one in
eight new jobs over the six-year economic expansion, has slowed in
recent months.
   In other economic news, consumers are still showing a reluctance
to open their wallets, and industry analysts say the slump could
continue through much of the summer.
   Many of the nation's largest general retailers, reporting their
May results Thursday, said sales were only marginally higher or
down from levels of a year earlier.
   High installment debt, an aversion to higher prices and boredom
with current fashions _ the same factors that have kept consumers
cautious for months _ contributed to the lackluster May performance
and were exacerbated by the unusually cool spring, analysts said.
   Wall Street had a slump of its own as stocks gave up some of
their recent gains amid rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 107.57 points
Tuesday and Wednesday, dropped back 11.56 Thursday to 2,052.45.
   Interest rates rose in the credit markets, reversing a sharp
decline Tuesday and Wednesday. That prompted many traders to sell
stocks in order to cash in on the gains of the past two sessions,
brokers said.
   Meanwhile, inflation fears, sparked by persistent rises in
agricultural commodity prices in recent days, pushed gold prices
sharply higher. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid for
gold of $466.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $8.75 from late
Wednesday.
   In other economic developments Thursday:
   _A new study on competitiveness showed the standard of living of
workers in other major countries has risen four times as fast as
the U.S. standard of living in the past 15 years.
   _The Federal Reserve reported that the narrowest measure of the
nation's money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $769.3
billion in the week ended May 23 from a revised $768.1 billion the
previous week.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the gross
national product, is an important barometer of the economy's health.
   ``The (May) sales were sluggish by normal standards,'' said
Jeffrey Edelman, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co., described
last month's sales as ``in line with or slightly below
conservatively budgeted expectations.''
   Retail sales have been sluggish for more than a year, and Feiner
said storeowners have responded by cutting back their inventories.
   He warned this could result in fewer orders to manufacturers and
``could potentially back up into the rest of the economy.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas oil tycoon Nelson Bunker Hunt insists it
was unstable world political conditions and inflation that led him
to buy silver _ not a plan to corner the world silver market.
   In his third day on the witness stand Thursday, Hunt came under
the scrutiny of plaintiff's attorney Mark Cymrot, but the one-time
billionaire stubbornly maintained his ground.
   Hunt and his two younger brothers are being sued for $150
million by Minpeco S.A., a mineral marketing company owned by the
government of Peru.
   The company claims the brothers _ Nelson Bunker, 62, William
Herbert, 59, and Lamar, 55 _ conspired unsuccessfully with several
Middle East businessmen to corner the world silver market between
1970 and 1980.
   In two days of questioning by his own lawyer, Paul Curran, Hunt
claimed he did not plot purchases of silver bullion and silver
futures with two other co-defendants, Mahmoud Fustok and Naji
Nahas, during a party at Fustok's home in France.
   When Cymrot noted the coincidence that both Nahas and Fustok
increased their purchases of silver futures after meeting with
Hunt, he replied: ``I talked about silver with everybody.''
   Hunt has insisted he was ``very bullish'' on silver as a hedge
against inflation and claimed that in 1979 he couldn't walk down a
street in Paris without being questioned about the precious metal
as an investment.
   ``I never knew anything about Fustok's operation,'' said Hunt at
one point. At another he claimed: ``I never knew what Nahas was
doing.''
   Fustok, a brother-in-law of the Saudi Arabian crown prince, was
the only other defendant to attend the trial. Three others, two
Arab sheiks and Nahas, a Lebanese businessman now living in Brazil,
have no U.S. holdings and did not challenge Minpeco's court papers.
   The sheiks, Ali Bin Mussalem and Mohammed Al-Amoudi, co-owned
with Nelson Bunker and William Herbert Hunt, International Metals
Investment Co., (IMIC), a Bermuda-based company which is also a
defendant in the case.
   Lawyers for Minpeco claim the Hunts and their Middle Eastern
co-defendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices
from about $9 an ounce to more than $50 an ounce between September
1979 and January 1980.
   Six financial institutions accused of participating in the
alleged conspiracy have settled with Minpeco for a total of $64.6
million.
   Minpeco claims the skyrocketing silver prices caused it to lose
more than $100 million when the world silver market collapsed in
March 1980, with prices falling back to about $10 an ounce.

   The nation's civilian unemployment rate rose
to 5.6 percent in May _ only its second increase in 20 months _ as
518,000 fewer Americans were at work than in the previous month,
the government said today.
   The 0.2 percentage point increase from a 14-year-low jobless
rate of 5.4 percent was accompanied by an increase of 173,000 in
the number of people listed by the Labor Department as officially
unemployed.
   The department said the labor force, those either holding jobs
or actively looking for them, shrunk by 363,000 to 122.7 million.
   The figures are based on a monthly survey of the nation's
households. The rate is seasonally adjusted to discount for
periodic, predictable influences on the calculations.
   A separate survey of employer payrolls showed the economy
creating 210,000 jobs in May, but that was down from an average job
growth over the last year of 250,000 a month.
   ``Almost all of the payroll job increase took place in the
service-producing sector,'' said Janet L. Norwood, the commissioner
of labor statistics.
   Ms. Norwood told the congressional Joint Economic Committee that
job growth in business services, which has accounted for one in
eight new jobs over the six-year economic expansion, has slowed to
an average of 15,000 in each of the last three months, compared
with an average monthly gain of 35,000-40,000 in 1987.
   Manufacturing employment grew by only 16,000 in May after a
45,000-job gain in April. Construction employment fell by 16,000
following a rise of 157,000 from January through April.
   The 0.2 percentage point drop in April's jobless rate _ the
first since October's small 0.1 percentage point rise and a match
to the 0.2 percent gain recorded in September 1986 _ had been
propelled largely by assembly line hiring as manufacturers tried to
keep with the surging foreign demand for American products.
   Ms. Norwood called May's 16,000 new factory jobs ``no real
change.'' But she said that both the machinery and metal products
industries had registered job growth over the month.
   ``The two export-influenced industries have paced the gains in
manufacturing over the last year, along with electrical equipment,
printing and publishing, chemicals and rubber and plastic
products.''
   The rebound in manufacturing has been accompanied by strong
growth in wholesale trade, which added 25,000 jobs last month.
   Over the last year, the Labor Department said, such employment
has climbed by 275,000, three-fourths of it in durable goods
distribution.
   Meanwhile, employment in finance, insurance and real estate fell
by 10,000 after a 2,000-job drop in April.
   The financial industry, which includes banks and brokerages, had
been one of the strongest areas of job growth through much of the
recovery, but has lost a total of 10,000 jobs since January.
   The biggest area of job growth last month was health services
with 35,000 new jobs, a reflection of the fact that the American
population is gradually aging.
   ``More jobs have been created'' in this area ``over the last
year than in any previous year,'' Ms. Norwood said. In that time,
380,000 health-care jobs have been created.
   She added, ``Our projections suggest that several of the health
industries will be among the 10 fastest-growing sources of
employment during the next decade.''
   While the household survey, on which the jobless rate is based,
showed a seasonally adjusted decline of 518,000 people at work, the
unadjusted figures showed an increase of more than 300,000.
   Ms. Norwood called the unadjusted increase ``very low by
historical standards and considerably lower'' than last May's 1.3
million unadjusted job gain.
   The unadjusted data for the period of April through July can
vary significantly.
   ``In past years, when May employment growth has been relatively
week, substantial expansions generally occurred in June or July,''
she said. ``It would be premature to draw any firm conclusions
about the direction of civilian employment from this one-month
household survey. At this time of the year, I believe, it's more
appropriate to focus on the business survey, which shows continued
_ although somewhat slower _ growth.''
   An alternate rate, including the 1.7 million members of the
armed services stationed in the United States, also rose in May, to
5.5 percent.
   The department gave this breakdown of civilian unemployment:
   _Whites, 4.7 percent, up from 4.6 percent.
   _Blacks, 12.4, up from 12.2.
   _Hispanics, 9.0, down from 9.3.
   _Men, 5.5, up from 5.2.
   _Women, 5.6, unchanged.
   _Teenagers, 15.6, down from 15.9.
   _Black teenagers, 36.6, up from 35.5.
   The export boom, unbridled consumer demand domestically and an
upward pressure on wages from the tightening job market have
triggered widespread fears of inflation.
   So far, however, there is little evidence that the declining
unemployment rate has triggered any significant wage-push inflation.
   ``We're lucky in that the latest shift in demand is stimulating
the Rust Belt, where there was a tremendous labor force that has
been underemployed,'' said William Dunkelberg, dean of the business
school at Temple University in Philadelphia. ``We can tap that for
awhile before we start running into inflation problems.''
   Two years ago, the consensus among private economists was that
any jobless rate below 6 percent would trigger an inflationary
spiral. When that figure was reached with only a 2 percent increase
in consumer prices, economists lowered their so-called
``non-inflationary full employment rate'' to 5.5 percent.
   Those numbers are again being revised downward, with Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greespan recently telling Congress that he
foresees no inflationary problem from wages until the jobless rate
approaches 5 percent.
   The consensus from a survey of 49 private economists last month
by Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, a newsletter edited by analyst
Robert Eggert of Sedona, Ariz., was that the unemployment rate
could fall to 4.9 percent before raising inflation problems.

   How secure is the nation's phone system? Ask
your disgruntled local florist.
   Thousands of mothers across the country didn't get their roses
or daffodils on Mother's Day this year because the phone system let
them down, and florists took the heat for it.
   ``Our customers thought that we were lying to them,'' said
Jacqui Apostolides, office manager of Manhattan's Academy Floral
Co., which belongs to the FTD network.
   The real culprit was a fire in a suburban Chicago central-office
switching center on May 8 that knocked out service to Florists'
Transworld Delivery Association.
   The Hinsdale, Ill., fire caused one of the most serious U.S.
telephone outages in years. Besides FTD, it temporarily disabled
the reservations center for Holiday Inns and a communications link
for air-traffic controllers at O'Hare Airport.
   The last set of customers with impaired service was scheduled to
be moved to a new switch Sunday at 12:01 a.m. CDT. But the
deficiencies revealed by the fire continue to exist throughout the
nation's phone system.
   Overall, the nation's phone system is reasonably secure, but
central-office switches such as the one in Hinsdale are its
Achilles' heels, according to interviews with phone company
executives, government officials and independent consultants.
   In addition, deregulation has accelerated competition, much as
in the airline industry, and has increased temptations for phone
companies to cut corners on safety to save money.
   While phone company officials say they continue to give top
priority to security issues, the Defense Department and other
agencies are stepping up their scrutiny of potential
vulnerabilities in the wake of the Bell System breakup.
   ``All the changes that have been made have left emergency
preparedness as a poor sister,'' said John C. McDonald, chairman of
a National Research Council panel that was funded by the Defense
Department and other federal agencies to examine the phone system's
security.
   ``What's lost in this is any element of national welfare,'' said
McDonald, who is vice president and chief scientist of Contel
Corp., an Atlanta-based phone company.
   Phone disruptions hurt more today because Americans depend on
telecommunications more than ever, for such things as department
store credit checks and automatic-teller machines.
   High technology contributes to the phone system's safety in some
cases, but detracts from it in others. Technology made it possible
for Illinois Bell to leave the Hinsdale central office unstaffed
and monitor it from Springfield, 200 miles away. But that meant no
one was around to snuff the fire when it broke out.
   The Hinsdale fire department could not be notified for more than
an hour because its own phones were knocked out. Incredibly,
Illinois Bell had no quick backup method of reaching the fire
department.
   Central offices are Achilles' heels because there is no easy way
around them. A medium-sized city may have one, while large cities
have several. All the calls in the area will go through its
switches, to be sent across town or funneled onto a long-distance
network.
   To protect themselves from failures at the central office, big
companies are increasingly opting for the controversial solution of
bypassing the local switch and plugging directly into long-distance
networks.
   But bypassing the local phone companies deprives them of
revenue, making it even harder for them to afford the improvements
that would lessen their vulnerability.
   Residences and small businesses are forced into dependence on
the local phone company because they can't afford the satellite
dishes or fiber-optic cables they would need to get around the
central office.
   ``Somebody like the local Domino's Pizza, they're out of luck,''
said Steven Glagow, manager of strategic business services for
Coopers & Lybrand in Houston.
   Outlying areas have become more vulnerable because phone
companies are saving money by closing some smaller central offices
and replacing them with so-called remote switching units.
   If a line breaks between the remote switching unit and the
central office where the switching is actually done, the area is
left without local phone service. In the old days, the line break
would have affected only attempts to call outside the local area.
   Long-distance networks are more secure than the local portion
because calls can be routed around a place where there is a break.
   But that doesn't mean there are no problems with long-distance
calls. In the era of fiber optics, when thousands of calls can be
carried over a single strand of glass, a misdirected backhoe can
cause more damage than ever.
   This past week, for example, telephone service into and out of
San Francisco over the MCI Communications Corp. network was
disrupted for about five hours after a road grader broke a
fiber-optic cable.
   To lessen its exposure to a fiber cut, American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. has two geographically separated fiber cables over
major routes, such as the Boston-to-Washington corridor and between
the East and West coasts. It is laying a third over each route.
Rivals are using the same strategy.
   AT&T is building a separate network whose sole job is to
establish the paths that long-distance calls will take. That
signaling network makes it easier to route around problem areas.
   Skeptics say the creation of a signaling network makes things
more vulnerable because the completion of a call now depends on the
proper functioning of two networks. But AT&T defends the
reliability of the signaling network.
   Deregulation has splintered the phone industry in ways that
reduce flexibility in response to a disaster. For example, phone
companies are installing many different brands of switches. If one
breaks down, it takes longer to get a replacement than if all of
them came from one source _ which used to be AT&T's Western
Electric Co.
   Trouble could also result from the fragmentation of the phone
system into rival public and private networks that don't
interconnect.
   The National Communications System, a group of federal agencies
primarily funded by the Pentagon, is taking early steps to build
links between the networks so the government can commandeer as much
transmission capacity as it needs in a national emergency.
   More is better when it comes to safety in the phone system _
more switches and more cables in more places, and more varied
methods of transmission. AT&T, for example, is supplementing its
main network with microwave radio transmission in a new digital
format.
   Illinois Bell defends its attention to the security of its phone
network, although it says it plans to study such issues as why it
was not able to reach the fire department for more than an hour.
   ``There'll be those that say that more can be done. But the
question is, Who do you have pay for that? ... It really gets to
the central issue of affordability of telephone service,'' said Tim
Bannon, an Illinois Bell spokesman.

   A computerized work station that lets
quadriplegics manipulate a mechanical arm and operate a personal
computer by speaking commands will mean jobs for many paralyzed
people, the manufacturer says.
   Architecture, engineering, law and small-parts assembly are
among the possible jobs quadriplegics could do with the $50,000
``Command 1'' work station, said Walter Weisel, chief executive
officer of Prab Command, Inc. of Kalamzaoo, Mich.
   ``Here's a system that costs less than a Mercedes, we can
deliver it in weeks and it puts you back on the payroll,'' Weisel
said.
   The system lets a quadriplegic make telephone calls and tap
computers and data bases around the world, record telephone
messages, operate the desktop computer for accounting and other
purposes, and perform a variety of other tasks for home and
workplace, the company says.
   It was introduced Thursday with a demonstration by Rick Walsh of
Seattle, a 50-year-old quadriplegic who was paralyzed 11 years ago
and calls himself a computer illiterate.
   Speaking into a headset, Walsh said, ``Keyboard. Robot. Get
Lotus. Keyboard.''
   At his side, a tan mechanical arm like those that hold up the
lamp in a dentist's office whirred quietly and fetched a book from
a shelf, presenting it to him.
   ``Stick Lotus. Keyboard,'' Walsh said. The arm put the book
back. Walsh said he had about three hours of training before the
demonstration.
   Similar systems have been developed in university laboratories,
said K.G. Engelhardt, director of the health and human services
robotics laboratory at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
But she said she knew of no other such system now on the market.
   Turning the research into a product is ``a very, very important
step and a difficult one,'' she said in a telephone interview.
``I'm really very pleased that it's happening.''
   To use the system, a quadriplegic must be able to see well
enough to read and to pronounce words or make consistent utterances
in place of ordinary words, Weisel said.
   He estimated that perhaps half the nation's quadriplegics _
people paralyzed in all four limbs _ could use it.
   Some 140,000 Americans are quadriplegics because of spinal cord
injury, said Thomas Stripling, associate director for health
studies and analysis at the Paralyzed Veterans of America. The
total may be about 600,000 if one adds people with quadriplegia
from other conditions such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis
and severe arthritis, he said in a telephone interview.
   The heart of the new system is the computer, which learns the
sound of each word or utterance and associates it with a command,
Weisel said.
   Once it learns the sound of one person's words, it will not
respond to the same words spoken by another person, which
introduces a measure of security, Weisel said.
   The full system requires 148 words to operate, said Greg Bodnar
of Prab.
   One large corporation is thinking about buying 200 or 300
systems to use in telephone marketing, Weisel said.
   By the end of the year, the company hopes to sell 40 systems
around the country, chiefly to rehabilitation and educational
centers, so that training can begin, Weisel said. A person can be
well trained in three or four days, he said.
   More general sales will begin next year, he said.

<HEAD>Bic Ordered to Give Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bic Corp. has been ordered to release
hundreds of internal documents on its disposable lighter, including
results of safety tests performed by the company and complaints by
users of the lighter.
   U.S. District Judge E. Mac Troutman on Thursday told the company
to release the documents to attorneys representing the estate of
Ethel L. Smith, a Schuylkill County woman who died in 1985,
allegedly after a Bic butane lighter exploded in her hands. The
estate is suing Bic, which is based in Milford, Conn., for $11
million.
   Other cases of exploding lighters are pending in other courts
and attorneys said the Smith case could have an impact on them.
   Troutman's 25-page memorandum and order affirms a decision by a
federal magistrate in 1987 that required Bic to turn over the
documents. In addition, the magistrate's order, also affirmed
Thursday by Troutman, did not grant a protective order barring
Smith's attorney's from distributing the documents to anyone else,
including attorneys representing other plaintiffs suing Bic.
   ``It's very, very significant,'' said John W. Andrews, a Tampa,
Fla., lawyer heading a Bic litigation group for the American Trial
Lawyers Association. ``The more (information) that's public, the
easier it will be to get it before a jury ... To have this
information available (for plaintiffs) is going to save them a
tremendous amount of money and time. And as soon as this
information gets out, the public will know what's going on there.''
   Michael B. Oropollo, a New Brunswick, N.J., lawyer who
represents Bic in the Smith suit and other cases, would not comment
on Troutman's decision and declined to say whether the company will
appeal.
   Ethel Smith, 66, died on July 15, 1985, two days after the
lighter she was using exploded, ``causing her to sustain severe
second- and third-degree burns over a great portion of her body,''
according to the suit filed on behalf of her estate by her husband,
Francis.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported last year that there had been
at least 10 deaths and hundreds of injuries associated with the Bic
lighter since 1979. Andrews said he is handling more than 15 cases
against Bic, including five in which the users died, allegedly from
injuries resulting when the lighters exploded.
   According to a statement from Bic, the company has sold more
than two billion lighters since it began selling them in the United
States in 1973. Under Troutman's orders, Bic must release all
information about complaints and accidents dating to 1977, when the
current Bic Mod II design was first sold. In addition, the company
must release all design information and test results regarding the
lighter.
   ``We find Bic USA's arguments that it would suffer significant
embarrassment and harm as a result of public disclosure of other
incidents involving the Bic Mod II lighter particularly
disingenuous given the extensive and detailed adverse publicity it
claims to have already received,'' Troutman wrote in his opinion.
   Bic has 30 days to comply with the order.

<HEAD>EEC Trade Gap With Japan Up 13 Percent In 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community's trade
deficit with Japan last year rose by 13 percent in dollar terms but
shrank 4 percent in terms of European currency units, the EEC
Commission said Friday.
   The weakening value of the dollar against European currencies
accounted for the discrepancy.
   The EEC's trade deficit with Japan rose to $24.2 billion in 1987
from $21.4 billion the year before. But in terms of European
currency units, or ecus, the gap narrowed to 20.9 billion ecus from
21.8 billion ecus.
   EEC exports to Japan rose 19 percent in 1987 to 13.62 billion
ecus, while Japan's exports to the EEC rose by a smaller 6 percent
to 34.5 billion ecus.
   The EEC's trade gap of $24.2 billion compares with a trade
deficit of almost $60 billion which the United States registered
with Japan last year.
   A Commission spokeswoman said the rise in EC exports to Japan
last year showed relations were improving slightly but said ``much
remained to be done'' by Japan to open up its market to EEC goods.

<TEXT>
   Takeover specialist Carl C. Icahn, whose
$60-per-share bid for Texaco Inc. has met a heavy dose of
skepticism on Wall Street, says he will have little problem raising
the necesary cash to finance the buyout.
   Meeting with securities analysts Thursday, Icahn said he would
have to borrow $8.86 billion to complete his offer, made last week,
to buy the 86.2 percent of the company's stock he does not already
own for $12.4 billion. The bid put a total value on Texaco's 207
million shares of $14.6 billion.
   To complete the deal, Icahn said he would sell two subsidiaries
_ Texaco Canada Inc. and the company's 50 percent interest in
Caltex, among other provisions.
   He then would borrow against the $2.98 billion cash flow
expected to be generated this year to obtain the remainder, Icahn
said.
   Texaco later scoffed at the plan, calling Icahn's offer ``still
illusory'' and dismissing the details he provided as ``sketchy,
sloppy and wrong.''
   Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, launched a proxy fight for
five of the company's 14 board seats on Friday, after the board
rejected his offer.
   He said he would have dropped the bid if Texaco had put it to a
shareholder vote at the company's annual meeting later this month.
   If his five-man slate wins, Icahn said Thursday he is confident
he would be able to persuade the board to sanction such a vote.
   As far as financing is concerned, ``We've had several banks tell
us we would have no trouble raising that on the basis that (the
takeover would be) on a friendly basis,'' Icahn said.
   On hostile terms, however, ``it would be just about impossible''
because of certain statutory requirements, he added.
   Texaco said in a statement issued from its White Plains, N.Y.,
headquarters that Icahn's $8.86 billion figure ``simply wished away
or ignored more than $5 billion in debt and other obligations he
would also have to immediately finance.
   ``Morgan Stanley & Co., our financial advisor, has informed
Texaco that Icahn's plan is simply not financable in their
opinion,'' the statement added.
   Securities analysts and the stock market have dimissed the offer
as a ploy, either to lure other bidders into the ring, or to
encourage Texaco's management to buy his shares or help him sell
them to a third party.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Texaco stock has traded just
above $50 a share _ far below the $60 Icahn proposed. In
late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, it stood
at $50.37{ a share, down 25 cents.
   Icahn acknowledged that his own $60-per-share price was
``cheap,'' saying: ``If it were out for a vote, there's no doubt in
my mind it would go higher, because there would be an auction.''
   Asked what price he believed would be fair, Icahn replied: ``I'm
not going to go into that.''
   From the start, Texaco officials questioned whether Icahn could
arrange financing for the deal, despite his pledge to put up $100
million that would be forfeited to the company if he failed to come
up with the financing in time for Texaco's annual meeting June 17
in Tulsa, Okla.
   Icahn stipulated, however, that the $100 million would not be
forfeited if another party topped his offer or if the Internal
Revenue Service failed to assent to the plan.
   On Thursday, he said his message to shareholders was simple:
``Even if you don't like me, if you vote for me, I'm going to get
you $60.'' And, he added, ``If I can't get you your $60, I'll
resign and (Texaco) will get its $100 million.''
   If his slate loses, Icahn said he would ``go away,'' and sell
his shares ``in a secondary offer of some such thing.''
   On another matter, Icahn also declined to comment on the
interest in Texaco of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., an investment
banking firm with a long record for conducting takeovers.
   In March Kohlberg said it bought 4.9 percent of Texaco's stock
and asked permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to
up that stake to 15 percent.
   Icahn told reporters that he had spoken to Henry Kravis but
stressed they were not collaborating.
   ``But that's not to say we have any deals with Henry Kravis, and
we don't. We absolutely don't,'' he added.
   Icahn paid about $1.2 billion in building his Texaco stake,
which is now worth about $1.8 billion.
   The amount he already has paid and the $12.4 billion he is
offering for the remaining Texaco shares would put his total cost
for acquiring the company at $13.6 billion _ the biggest sum ever
paid in a corporate buyout.
   The biggest deal so far was the $13.4 billion acquisition of
Gulf Corp. by Standard Oil Co. of California, now Chevron Corp., in
1984.

   Union Carbide Corp. announced Friday it
would withhold $192 million in interim relief to victims of the
Bhopal gas leak while it appeals the order to the Supreme Court of
India.
   The Indian State High Court ordered Carbide to pay the interim
compensation April 4.
   ``The needs of the victims will be fully addressed only in the
context of a final resolution of all issues,'' Carbide said in a
statement. ``The questions of liability and damages must be decided
through fair means _ not through retroactively reinventing the
law.''
   The company accused the Indian goverment of delaying final
resolution of lawsuits stemming from the December 1984 gas leak at
a Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, by first trying to sue Carbide in
U.S. courts and then ``by subsequently circumventing existing laws
in India.''
   ``Unlawful court orders generate lawful appeals to higher
courts,'' the company said. ``Denying justice to Union Carbide
Corp. ultimately does not help the Bhopal victims.''
   The Indian government says at least 2,660 peple were killed and
40,000 injured when methyl isocyanate leaked from a pesticide plant
owned by a Union Carbide subsidiary on Dec. 3, 1984 in the world's
worst industrial disaster.
   Carbide contends the leak was the result of sabotage.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened sharply higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid continuing weather-driven
speculation.
   Soybean meal opened up its daily $10-a-ton limit and that lent
strong support to soybean, corn and oat futures, which also were up
the limit within minutes of the opening.
   Some analysts linked the runup in soybean meal futures to rumors
of heavy Soviet buying of South American meal. But Cathy Leow, an
analyst in New York with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc., said
traders were merely using such talk as an excuse to advance the
dry-weather rally.
   ``With no rains in the forecast, nobody wants to be caught
short, so you've got a lot of people wanting to buy and no one
wanting to sell,'' she said.
   Only scattered rains were predicted for the Grain Belt during
the weekend, and longer-range forecasts called for another week of
unseasonably warm, dry weather.
   In early trading, wheat was 7 cents to 8 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.58 a bushel; corn was 7 cents
to 7} cents higher with July at $2.32 a bushel; oats were 9\ cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $1.96{ a bushel; soybeans were 9{
cents to 26{ cents higher with July at $8.45 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .13 cent higher with June at
72.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .50 cent lower
with August at 76.10 cents a pound; hogs were .90 cent lower to .05
cent higher with June at 52.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .53 cent to .70 cent lower with July at 56.35 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures advanced on Thursday while pork futures settled
lower.

<TEXT>
   Hitachi Ltd. said Friday it managed its first gains in profits
and sales in three years in fiscal 1987 as profit jumped 39 percent
and revenue climbed 3 percent.
   Hitachi, the giant Japanese manufacturer of electronics and
electrical equipment, said its profit rose to 136.8 billion yen, or
$1.09 billion, in the fiscal year ended March 31, from 98.7 billion
yen a year earlier.
   Revenue rose to 4.98 trillion yen, or $39.8 billion, from 4.85
trillion yen a year earlier.
   The increases left Hitachi still short of its peak year of
fiscal 1984, when revenue surpassed 5 trillion yen and profit was
more than 210 billion yen.
   Hitachi attributed the gains to a continued advance in its
computer business, a recovery in semiconductors and gains from the
upswing in Japan's domestic demand. It said those offset a mediocre
showing by its heavy electrical equipment and consumer products
sectors.
   The results, which include the consolidated results of its
overseas subsidiaries, were converted into dollars at a rate of 125
yen to the dollar.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Shrinks 12.7 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The broadest measure of Japan's trade surplus
shrank 12.7 percent in April from its level of a year earlier as
imports climbed 30 percent to record levels, according to
government figures released Friday.
   The current account, which covers trade in merchandise as well
as services and investment income, posted a $7.12 billion surplus,
down from $8.15 billion surplus a year earlier and an $8.12 billion
surplus in March, the Finance Ministry said.
   Japan's surplus also declined in the narrower measure of
merchandise trade alone, falling 4.5 percent to $8.49 billion from
$8.89 billion a year earlier and $9.24 billion in March.
   The strength of the Japanese yen and a government-promoted
economic expansion are encouraging strong growth in imports. The
trade gap is shrinking because imports are rising even faster than
Japan's rapidly expanding exports.
   Imports, measured when contracts were settled, climbed to a
record $13.5 billion in April from $10.4 billion a year earlier.
They were up 2 percent from $13.2 billion in March.
   Exports, also gauged at the time of customs clearance, grew 14.1
percent to $21.9 billion from $19.2 billion in the year-earlier
month. They fell 2.2 percent from $22.4 billion in March.
   The trade pattern is encouraging for the Japanese government,
which has been trying to restore balance to international trade in
a coordinated effort with such other industrial countries as the
United States, West Germany and Britain.
   Imports of manufactured goods have been rising especially fast,
they noted, accounting for 49.9 percent of the total imports in
April, the largest in Japan's recent history. In March,
manufactured goods held a 47.7 percent import share.
   Officials also pointed out that a growing number of Japanese
companies are stepping up imports of products they have made at the
plants that have been established overseas in an attempt to cushion
the impact of the yen's strength.
   The export growth was supported by considerable overseas demand
for products like business machines and computers, according to
officials. April's exports were the third largest on record.
   After seasonal factors were taken into account, the April
current account registered a surplus of $6.37 billion, down 12.6
percent from $7.28 billion in the previous month.
   The seasonally adjusted trade balance was in the black by $7.74
billion dlrs, dwindling from $8.40 billion in March. Seasonally
adjusted imports increased 3.7 percent to $12.9 billion from $12.4
billion but exports dipped 1 percent to $20.6 billion from $20.8
billion.

<HEAD>Four High Schools Named Finalists In Supercomputer Giveaway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four high schools _ one from Florida, one from
California and two from the Washington, D.C., area _ have been
named finalists in a contest to receive a million-dollar
supercomputer.
   ETA Systems Inc. of St. Paul, Minn., which is donating the
computer, says the machine would be the first in the world to be
installed in a secondary school.
   Named as finalists were North Florida Christian School in
Tallahassee, Fla.; James Logan High School in Union City, Calif.;
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in
Alexandria, Va.; and Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring,
Md.
   ETA, a subsidiary of Control Data Corp., says the contest is
intended to ``identify and encourage excellence in computational
science at the U.S. secondary school level.'' It also gives the
company publicity in its bid to take business away from Cray
Research Inc., the dominant supercomputer maker.
   The four finalists were culled from 99 semifinalists. Some 1,500
schools, or roughly 6 percent of secondary schools in the country,
responded to the SuperQuest announcement. The winner will be
announced Aug. 12.
   Teams at each school, composed of four students and a teacher,
had to say what they would do with the supercomputer. Ideas ranged
from studying the life cycle of the Southern bald eagle and
improving school climate to ``calculating Van de Wall forces for
peptide chains and amino acids.''

<HEAD>London Stocks Close Up 8.9 Points</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with close.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices rose Friday as the opening of a new
trading account on London's Stock Exchange prompted some fresh
buying.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 8.9
points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 1,819.2. Volume was a healthy
616.6 million shares, compared with Thursday's 516.2 million shares.
   Traders said there was a bit of buying at the opening of the new
two-week trading account, pushing the 100-stock index up an
additional 5 points, but there was a lack of follow-through and the
index drifted back.
   London's Stock Exchange divides trading into two-week and
three-week trading periods for accounting purposes. Trades must be
completed within 10 days of a period ending.
   ``Some buying crept back into the market,'' said Nicholas
Knight, an equity analyst with James Capel and Co.
   Selected international stocks were aided by the pound's
weakening over the course of the week.
   Sterling was little changed, but investor demand for certain
dollar-dependent issues had not subsided, dealers said.

   The stock market declined slightly today,
getting little mileage out of the latest data on the employment
situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 6 points
at midday, was off 2.13 at 2,050.32 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 681 up, 705 down and 497
unchanged.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that
nonfarm payroll employment increased by 209,000 in May, while the
overall unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent the
month before.
   Analysts said those figures showed a little less strength in the
economy than had been anticipated, and thus served to dampen
worries about inflation somewhat.
   Interest rates declined moderately in the credit markets,
putting yields on long-term government bonds in the neighborhood of
9.1 percent to 9.2 percent.
   But traders seemed leery of chasing after stocks after their
sharp runup earlier in the week.
   Among the blue chips, Procter & Gamble rose [ to 77];
International Business Machines slipped [ to 112{; American
Telephone & Telegraph lost \ to 26}, and Eastman Kodak was
unchanged at 43~.
   Abbott Laboratories fell 2[ to 44~ and Bristol-Meyers 1~ to 40~
on reports that Nestle S.A. was preparing to introduce a product to
compete with Abbott's and Bristol's infant formulas.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.24 to 149.43. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .56 at 299.64.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 135.55 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Federal Studies Should Boost Airline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The favorable results of federal investigations
into Eastern Airlines' safety and management should boost the
struggling carrier's business, although many travelers may still
hesitate to book flights, analysts and travel agents say.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday its
plane-by-plane inspections showed no serious problems and the
Department of Transportation concluded, after an unprecedented
probe, that Houston-based Texas Air Corp. was capable and willing
to run Eastern and its other key carrier, Continental Airlines.
   The results ``should probably help them (Eastern). They passed
the test,'' John Pincavage, airline analyst for PaineWebber Inc.,
said.
   Anthony Hatch, analyst for Argus Research in New York, said the
reports help ``restore their reputation and begin the healing, now
that the worst of the wound is over. The worst of the hemorrhaging
is over.''
   But even more important than the government's report would be
news reports of on-time, courteous service, he said.
   Eastern lost $181 million last year and its management has
reported more losses and declines in passengers this year. It has
complained about campaigns led by Eastern unions charging that
management was creating unsafe conditions.
   Pincavage said some resistance to flying Eastern is likely to
remain because of its lackluster service.
   Bill Cooper, owner of Adventure Travels in Pompano Beach, said
client surveys have shown travelers have been more satisfied with
Eastern service in recent weeks. But only time will tell, he said,
if those who switched airlines and signed up with another
frequent-flier program will be willing to go back to Eastern.
   Norman Koppen, owner of Viking Travel in Coral Gables, said: ``I
think the problems are deeper'' than safety.
   ``Just the fact that there's ongoing internal strife within the
company gives people cause for apprehension,'' he said.
   Business travelers, in particular, ``have a very long memory''
about service problems, said Koppen, a former manager at Eastern.
   ``I think the fact that they got a clean bill of health is going
to have a nominal effect on restoring people's confidence,'' he
said.
   The Department of Transportation probe ``found no basis for
serious concern about management competence,'' said Transportation
Secretary James Burnley.
   After their six-week scrutiny of owner Texas Air Corp.'s
fitness, the investigators also decided that neither Eastern nor
Continental is in any immediate danger of financial failure.
   The 30-day ramp inspections of Eastern and Continental by the
FAA proved ``an unsafe condition does not currently exist among the
carriers,'' FAA Administrator T. Allan McArtor said.
   When the government investigation was launched in April, airline
analysts called it a victory for union lobbying in an election-year
Congress.
   Machinists President Charles Bryan charged that Texas Air
lobbying had influenced investigation findings.
   He called the final report ``an absolute clear whitewash'' and
said Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo ``has proved he's the darling
of the FAA and the DOT.''
   Lorenzo, at a Washington news conference Thursday, hailed the
federal report as showing Eastern and Continental ``are absolutely
safe and absolutely fit. Those airlines passed inspection with
flying colors.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell called the investigation
``comprehensive and thorough'' and said that ``any charge to the
contrary by a union leader is simply more of the same distorted
rhetoric we've been hearing for years. The findings vindicate
Eastern's operations and maintenance practices. No amount of
soap-box grandstanding can change those findings.''
   Eastern and the Machinists are in federal mediation and the
pilots union's contracts is opened to be amended July 1. Eastern
wants to cut labor costs by $450 million, or nearly 30 percent.

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Close Sharply Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade with many corn, oat and
soybean contracts advancing their daily limits amid fears of crop
damage due to dry weather.
   The session ended a week of dramatic gains for the grain markets
and reflected concerns that the emerging crops face a real threat
if arid conditions in the Midwest continue, analysts said.
   Weather forecasts called for no rain in the region this weekend
and below-normal precipitation next week.
   ``This is the first time in at least six weeks that we're
fininshing up a Friday afternoon without having to worry about a
weekend weather system,'' said Rich Feltes, grain analyst for Refco
Inc. in Chicago. ``This weekend, it clearly is not going to rain.''
   Feltes said field observers had reported that the soybean and
corn crops were off to a ``suboptimal start'' and in worse
condition than in either 1980 or 1983, years that also had unusally
dry springs.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 14 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.62{ a bushel; corn was up 9{
cents to 10 cents, the daily limit, with July at $2.34\ a bushel;
oats were up the 10-cents-a-bushel limit across the board with July
at $1.96{ a bushel; soybeans were up 9{ cents to 30 cents, the
daily limit, with July at $8.49 a bushel.

   A pair of big building contractors from Japan
and the United States announced Friday they had formed an
association to explore possible joint ventures, but the American
partner said it does not expect to win much construction work in
Japan.
   The linkage was announced by New York-based Turner Corp., the
biggest U.S. general contractor for buildings, and Kumagai Gumi Co.
Ltd., one of Japan's big six contractors.
   ``Currently we have none (business in Japan), nor do we expect
to have any major operations there. It allows us to have a very
small start, if you will, in Japan,'' said Hal Parmelee, president
of Turner Construction Co., Turner's U.S. subsidiary.
   Parmelee confirmed the linkage was prompted by a diplomatic
agreement reached last month that would open the Japanese
construction market wider to U.S. contractors. He said it could
also help Turner get work from Japanese clients in the United
States, although both companies will continue to do some
independent work.
   In a more extensive deal, Parsons Corp., a Pasadena,
Calif.-based engineering firm, last month announced agreements with
Japan's Shimizu Corp. to pursue projects together in Japan and to
form a jointly owned Japanese company.
   Turner and Kumagai Gumi have already worked together on three
joint construction ventures in Manhattan with a total value of $215
million: Americas Towers, John Jay College of Criminal Justice and
Hospital for Special Surgery.
   Japan's Kansai International Airport project, a subject of
intense negotiation between the United States and Japan, is one
that Turner and Kumagai Gumi said they have ``strong interest in
and will initially pursue.''
   Kumagai Gumi is about twice the size of Turner. It ranked
seventh in the world among general contractors in 1986, while
Turner ranked 193rd, according to ENR, McGraw-Hill Inc.'s weekly
construction magazine.

<TEXT>
   Heck's Inc. said Friday it planned to sell
40 of its discount department stores as part of a restructuring
plan required by U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Officials also announced the company suffered a loss of $2.1
million for the first quarter.
   Heck's President John Isaac said in a statement company
officials have begun discussions on the proposed reorganization
plan with the lenders' and creditors' committees appointed by the
bankruptcy judge.
   ``The restructuring will include the sale of approximately 40
leased and owned stores operated by Heck's and by its subsidiary,
Maloney Enterprises Inc.,'' Isaac's statement said.
   Heck's has stores in eight states: Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.
   Isaac said the ``restructuring will enable the company's
management team to focus its efforts on that segment of the retail
store business which offers ther greatest current prospect for
profitable operations.''
   It was not announced which stores would be sold.
   The move would leave the retailer with 75 to 80 stores and a
work force of about 3,300 employees. Heck's, once a 165-store
chain, closed nearly 40 other outlets last year in addition to its
Federal Wholesale Co. division.
   Company attorney William Bragg said layoffs would occur in all
parts of the company, as well as in its administrative offices and
warehousing operations in Nitro, but he said he did not know how
many people were involved.
   After a number of postponements, Heck's must file the
reorganization with the court by July 1 or lose the right to offer
an exclusive plan.

   The stock market gained more ground Friday,
rounding out a week of sharp gains that caught many Wall Streeters
by surprise.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 18.85 to
2,071.30, extending its gain for the week to 114.86 points.
   That surpassed the previous record weekly point rise of 108.26
set last Dec. 14-18, though it fell well short of some past weekly
percentage increases.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
946 issues up, 548 down and 478 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 189.60 million
shares, down from 193.54 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 212.87 million shares.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that
nonfarm payroll employment increased by 209,000 in May, while the
overall unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent the
month before.
   Analysts said those figures showed a little less strength in the
economy than had been anticipated, and thus served to dampen
worries about inflation somewhat.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets, putting yields on
long-term government bonds in the neighborhood of 9.05 percent to
9.1 percent.
   Just a short while ago, Treasury bond rates appeared to be
closing in on 9.5 percent.
   After weathering mild bouts of selling late in the morning and
at midafternoon, stocks came on strong near the close.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Alcoa, up 1\ at 49;
International Paper, up 1 at 43\; DuPont, up { at 85]; Philip
Morris, up 1] at 86}, and International Business Machines, up | at
113\.
   Brokers said basic-industry stocks in businesses like chemicals
and paper attracted investors who reasoned that moderate growth in
the economy would allow industrial America to continue posting
robust earnings gains.
   Abbott Laboratories fell 1~ to 45[ and Bristol-Meyers lost 1{ to
41\, both in active trading, on reports that Nestle S.A. was
preparing to introduce a product to compete with Abbott's and
Bristol's infant formulas.
   Biocraft Laboratories dropped 1[ to 14[. The company reported
earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31 of 13 cents a
share, down from 19 cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

0.48 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .64 to 150.31.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.22 to 307.58, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.12 at 266.45.

   Financier Carl C. Icahn's multibillion-dollar
bid for Texaco Inc. gained no ground Friday as Wall Street remained
unmoved by his latest attempt to drum up support from investors.
   In a meeting with more than 300 oil industry and investment
specialists late Thursday, Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder,
gave the first details of how he would finance the proposed
acquisition and said he was certain he would have no trouble
getting the money.
   But the oil giant's stock stayed around the $50 level Friday _
or $10 below Icahn's offer _ where it had hovered since the bid was
announced. It slipped 50 cents a share to close at $50 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   ``That basically tells you that probably not a huge number of
minds were changed'' by Icahn's presentation, said Sanford
Margoshes, who studies oil companies for the Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. securities firm.
   Icahn is seeking to buy the 86.2 percent of Texaco's stock he
does not already own for $12.4 billion. His proposal puts the
company's total value at $14.6 billion.
   He told the analysts he would need $8.86 billion in loans to
finance the deal. He said he would sell two subsidiaries _ Texaco
Canada Inc. and the company's 50 percent interest in Caltex _ then
borrow against an anticipated $2.98 billion in 1988 cash flow to
cover the financing.
   Some analysts said they agreed with Icahn's assertion that the
deal was ``eminently doable.'' Many others were not so sure.
   Texaco also scoffed at the plan, saying it was ``still
illusory'' and dismissing the details he provided as ``sketchy,
sloppy and wrong.''
   Texaco's board refused last week to let shareholders vote on the
takeover offer at the company's annual meeting June 17.
   On Thursday, Icahn admitted he would first have to win his proxy
fight for five seats on Texaco's 14-member board before he would
have a chance of getting the offer before Texaco's shareholders.
   He said several banks had told him if the proposal were then
accepted, he ``would have no trouble'' raising the necessary cash
to complete the deal.
   Once elected, Icahn argued, he and his associates would have no
problem pursuading the board to field the proposal for a vote,
simply because the ``mandate'' their election would be irresistable.
   Some analysts disagreed.
   ``The record of proxy contests is so irrational,'' said Philip
L. Dodge, of Nomura Securities International Inc. ``Management
almost always wins, and as a rule the price of the stock goes
down.''
   Even if Icahn won, Dodge continued, he still would only have
five of 14 members, which could lead to a long internal fight.
   And ``there is no mandate a management can't ignore,'' Dodge
said.
   Icahn won something of a victory in a related development
Friday, when a federal judge in White Plains, N.Y., rejected
Texaco's request that he void Icahn's directors slate before the
annual meeting.
   But U.S. District Judge Gerard Goettel left open the possibility
that he might still overturn the election should Icahn's slate win
and Texaco prevail in a suit charging Icahn with alleged violations
of federal securities laws.
   Several analysts said that no matter how the proxy fight comes
out, the market still doubted Icahn's explanation of how he would
come up with the money to pay for the Texaco takeover.
   ``The disappointment was that there's no firm financing in
place,'' said Rosario Ilacqua of Nikko Securities Co.
International, Inc.
   Ilacqua said Icahn would have to put up hefty fees to line up
the money _ fees he might not want to pay in advance.
   ``It all boils down to the proxy fight. If he loses, he's not
going to need the money,'' Ilacqua said.
   Oppenheimer & Co.'s Paul Ting also said there was ``a lot of
skepticism about Icahn's financing ability.''
   In particular, Ting said he believed Icahn had sharply
underestimated the money Texaco would have to pay for future
exploration and production costs.
   ``If you're a bank, you're going to lend money to Mr. Icahn only
if you feel comfortable about getting it back. So banks are going
to look at that more than anything else,'' he said.
   Other analysts suggested Icahn's figures did not include
adequate provisions covering payments of the company's debt.
   Texaco said Icahn's $8.86 billion figure ``simply wished away or
ignored more than $5 billion in debt and other obligations he would
also have to immediately finance.''
   ``Morgan Stanley & Co., our financial adviser, has informed
Texaco that Icahn's plan is simply not financeable in their
opinion,'' the statement added.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose Friday against most major
currencies except the Japanese yen and gold gave back some of its
gains in another busy session.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at
$464 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $466.25 an ounce late
Thursday.
   Traders said there was no major economic news to account for the
activity, although the Labor Department announced the U.S. civilian
unemployment rate rose in April for the first time in 20 months, to
5.6 percent from 5.4 percent the previous month.
   ``People are trading off the charts,'' that is, trying to pick
out trends in rates, said Mark Pletscher, an assistant vice
president for corporate foreign exchange at BankAmerica
International. ``Fundamentals you almost have to put aside right
now.''
   Gold rose sharply in Asia and Europe, catching up with the gains
made in Thursday's hectic session in New York. Gold continued to
rise in New York, climbing as much as $2 an ounce, but then sank
late in the session and finished below late Thursday's levels.
   ``These two days have been as active as we've seen in months''
in the precious metals markets, said James Koppel, managing
director of Deak International Trading (U.S.) Ltd.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to a closing 126.11 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 125.95 yen. In New York, the
dollar finished at 125.97 yen, down from 126.12 yen late Thursday.
   The British pound rose against the dollar in London, to $1.8005
from $1.7967 late Thursday. But later in New York, sterling dipped
to $1.7970 from $1.8044.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.7266 West German marks, up from
1.7211; 1.4391 Swiss francs, up from 1.4351; 1.2314 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2308; 5.8333 French francs, up from 5.8270; and
1,283.75 Italian lire, up from 1,281.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.7248 West German marks, down from 1.7295; 1.4363
Swiss francs, down from 1.4425; 5.8293 French francs, down from
5.8502; 1.9355 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9413; 1,282.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,286.75; and 1.2311 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2325.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $463.71 a troy ounce, up
from $455.38.
   Later in London gold rose to a late bid of $464.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $454.30. That was its highest price
since Jan. 28, when it fetched $466.50 an ounce.
   In Zurich, gold gained $12.50 an ounce, closing at a bid $465.50
compared with $453 late Thursday _ its best since Jan. 8.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $464.80 a troy ounce from $467 an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices, powered by gold's gains, also jumped on
the London market, where the metal was trading at a late bid price
of $7.31 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $6.73. On New
York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $7.225 a
troy ounce from $7.260.

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Soar On Dry Weekend Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean, corn and oat futures soared the limit allowed for daily
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade Friday amid fears of crop
damage due to dry weather. Wheat futures also moved sharply higher.
   On other markets, pork futures prices plummeted while cattle
futures were mixed; precious metals dipped; energy futures
retreated; and stock-index futures were lower.
   The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities advanced
2.02 points to 255.10, with 10 components scoring gains, eight
showing losses and three ending mixed.
   Friday's session ended a week of dramatic gains for the grain
and soybean markets and reflected concerns that the emerging crops
face a real threat if arid conditions in the Midwest continue,
analysts said.
   The amount of spring rain in the Midwest has been far below
normal. Most of the region's central portion _ including Illinois,
Indiana and Missouri _ received no measurable rainfall for 10 days,
the National Weather Service reported Friday, and south-central
Wisconsin had gone more than three weeks without measurable
precipitation.
   Weather forecasts called for no rain in the region this weekend
and the weather service, in a six-to-10-day forecast issued after
the close, predicted below-normal precipitation and above-normal
temperatures in the Midwest through June 13.
   ``This is the first time in at least six weeks that we're
fininshing up a Friday afternoon without having to worry about a
weekend weather system moving in,'' said Rich Feltes, grain analyst
for Refco Inc. in Chicago. ``This weekend, it clearly is not going
to rain.''
   Feltes said field observers had reported that the soybean and
corn crops were off to a ``sub-optimal start'' and were in worse
condition than in either 1980 or 1983, years that also had unusally
dry springs.
   Wheat settled 2 cents lower to 14 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in July at $3.62} a bushel; corn was up 9} cents to 10
cents, the daily limit, with July at $2.34{ a bushel; oats were up
the 10-cents-a-bushel limit across the board with July at $1.96{ a
bushel; soybeans were up 8} cents to 30 cents, the daily limit,
with July at $8.49 a bushel.
   Most pork futures posted sharp losses on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in response to a drop in cash prices, analysts said.
   ``We had lower-than-expected cash hogs come in this morning on
the heels of a larger-than-expected country hog run yesterday,''
said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc.
   ``The packers had already fulfilled their Saturday slaughter
requirements and demand diminished,'' he said. ``That caught the
trade by surprise and washed the market out pretty good to the
downside.''
   Cattle futures were mixed as selling sentiment spilled over from
the pork pits, offsetting the positive effects of anticipated
higher boxed beef prices, Stanley said.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .33 cent higher with June
at 72.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .68 cent
lower with August at 75.92 cents a pound; hogs were 1.40 cents
lower to .23 cent higher with June at 52.45 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .83 cent to 1.50 cents lower with July at at
55.55 cents a pound.
   Precious metals retreated on profit-taking after three days of
sharp gains.
   ``I think the metals have established that they are in an
uptrend, a pretty strong uptrend,'' said Craig Sloane, metals
analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
``Sometimes when you get a market in an uptrend it backs off a bit,
then continues on its way. I think that's what we're seeing here.''
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $1.80 to
$2.20 lower with the active August contract at $469.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 3.5 cents lower with July at $7.27 a
troy ounce.
   Platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $17.40 to
$17.60 lower with July at $610.60 a troy ounce.
   Oil prices slipped lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
quiet trading based mostly on technical factors, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents to 15 cents
lower with July at $17.50 a barrel; heating oil was .25 cent to .31
cent lower with July at 47.13 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.38 cent to .62 cent lower with July at 50.89 cents a gallon.
   Stock index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .25 point lower at 266.10.

<HEAD>EDS Criticizes Perot for Hiring Executives Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electronic Data Systems Corp. on Friday criticized
its founder, H. Ross Perot, for luring eight executives away just
one day after a moratorium against such recruiting expired.
   ``We're just disappointed he did it,'' said Bill Wright, a
spokesman for EDS, which is now a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.
   On Thursday, Perot announced the formation of a new company,
Perot Systems Corp., which included three EDS corporate officers
and five of the company's divisional managers. Their experience
ranges from 11 years to 20 years.
   The announcement caused a sharp drop in the price of GM's Class
E stock, the dividend of which is tied to the performance of EDS.
   Wright said the defections would not hurt the company, which has
48,000 employees in all 50 states and 29 countries. He said
investors should not fear a talent drain from EDS to Perot.
   However, he added, ``We will take measures to protect our
people. We want to make sure our employees know what their
opportunities are.''
   The move by Perot was another twist in a tumultuous relationship
with General Motors, which bought EDS in 1984 for $2.5 billion.
   After the automaker bought the computer services company, Perot
and GM executives began feuding. GM finally paid Perot $700 million
in 1986 to leave EDS, which he had founded in 1962.
   As part of the agreement with GM, Perot was barred from hiring
any EDS employees for two years, a period that expired Wednesday.
   A day later Perot revealed he had formed the new company and
said its first job would be to conduct a three-month, $500,000
study on how to cut costs in the U.S. Postal Service.
   Perot said the timing of his announcement had nothing to do with
the expiration of his agreement with GM. He said the Postal Service
was eager to get the job started.
   The 57-year-old billionaire also denied Friday that revenge
played a part in luring the eight executives away.
   ``Absolutely not. The whole purpose was to build a company that
could work on a large complex job,'' Perot said.
   He also said the new company did not pose a threat to EDS, which
he said has ``tremendous talent.''
   Immediately after Perot's announcement Thursday, GM's Class E
stock dropped $2.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. The
stock edged back up 50 cents Friday to close at $40.37{.
   Perot said he took no delight from the drop. ``That's just Wall
Street being Wall Street. It's an emotional reaction based on
nothing,'' he said.
   The settlement between Perot and GM also prohibited him from
launching a new for-profit business that would compete with EDS
prior to Dec. 1, 1989. The postal contract is a no-profit agreement
until the expiration date, when it will be eligible for a share of
any savings that result from the studies.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices jumped higher Friday in moderate
trading, capping a four-day trading week in which they posted
vigorous advances.
   Analysts said bond prices were boosted in Friday's session by a
new government report showing a modest rise in U.S. unemployment in
May, which was reassuring for the outlook for inflation. The gains
also reflected a perception in the market that the Federal Reserve
was keeping its credit policy stable, judging from its operations
in the open market, traders said.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond surged about a
point, or $10 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves inversely to its price, dropped from 9.14 percent late
Thursday to 9.04 percent _ its lowest level since late April.
   The yield on the 30-year issue has tumbled from 9.31 percent
last Friday, before the Memorial Day holiday.
   The Labor Department reported the nation's civilian unemployment
rate rose to 5.6 percent in May _ only its second increase in 20
months _ indicating a possible slowdown in economic growth. Bond
prices had been dragged down in recent weeks by fears that an
overheated economy could reignite inflation, a key enemy of
fixed-income investments such as bonds.
   ``The market is anticipating better (economic) numbers,'' said
William Sullivan, director of money-market research at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   He said market participants are expecting further confirmation
that growth has moderated from economic indicators to be released
in the near future, including next Friday's wholesale price index
for May.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues ranged from 7-32 point to ] point higher,
intermediate maturities advanced 15-32 point to 25-32 point, and
long-term issues jumped 11-16 point, according to figures provided
by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.52 to 109.68. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
Daily Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, stood
at 1,147.94, up 5.63.
   In corporate trading, industrials rose } point and utilities
advanced | point in light trading, according to the investment firm
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, was up 0.34 at 278.57.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was up [ point at 88 as of 3 p.m. EDT. The
average yield declined to 8.13 percent from 8.14 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, edged up 2
basis points to 6.45 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a
percentage point. Six-month bills tumbled 9 basis points to 6.71
percent and one-year bills fell 6 basis points to 7.01 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7\ percent, down from 7]
percent late Thursday.

   Farmers Insurance Group Inc. and Batus Inc.
both claimed to have won the hearts of Farmers shareholders Friday
after the release of a preliminary count of a vote on Batus' $4.5
billion hostile takeover bid for Farmers.
   Batus, a Kentucky-based tobacco and retailing conglomerate,
claimed the vote went 51 percent in favor of a resolution calling
on Farmers management to negotiate with Batus.
   But Farmers maintained Batus got only 40 percent of the vote.
   Farmers' version of the count included abstentions, said
spokesman Tom Welch. Farmers bylaws require a resolution to win the
support of a majority of those shares eligible to vote rather than
a majority of those actually casting votes, he said.
   The preliminary tally compiled by independent counter, Copeople from
Hargeisa to the
nearby town of Garowe before the operation stopped because of a
curfew, said the British High Commission in Mogadishu, the Somali
capital.
   The airlift, coordinated by the U.N. Development Program, was to
resume Saturday.
   There are 25 Britons and about 20 Americans among the 160
foreigners, said diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity. They
did not have a breakdown on the other nationalities. Most of the
foreigners are aid workers.
   The Somali National Movement, engaged in a 7-year-old struggle
to overthrow the government of Maj. Gen. Mohamed Siad Barre,
claimed it took Hargeisa on Tuesday and the main port of Berbera a
day later.
   Diplomats in Mogadishu said there was light fighting but that
Hargeisa was in government hands.
   ``Berbera is peaceful but tense,'' British diplomats in
Mogadishu said in a telex message. ``There are no immediate plans
for evacuation.''
   The government has not commented on the fighting.
   Rebel officials, reached by telephone in London and in Addis
Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, claimed their forces controlled
Hargeisa and were battling soldiers holed up in barracks near the
airport, six miles outside the town.
   Ahmed Mohamed Silanyo, chairman of the rebel movement, said in a
telephone interview from London that 20,000 to 30,000 civilians
were fighting alongside his forces, whose strength he refused to
reveal.
   ``Siad Barre has been arming the people for years to fight each
other in tribal conflicts. Now they are using those guns against
him,'' Silanyo said.
   Richard Greenfield, an Oxford University professor and a
political adviser to the Somali government from 1977-86, said he
believed civilians were joining the rebel forces, which had not
been particularly effective until now.
   ``I think this is the most serious confrontation that Siad has
faced in the whole of his career,'' Greenfield said.
   Silanyo said he did not know how many government troops were
involved, but he said scores had defected to the movement.
   Silanyo, a former minister of commerce and planing under Siad
Barre, was elected the rebel movement's chairman in 1984.
   Siad Barre took power in a 1969 military coup.
   Silanyo said the rebel offensive was timed to coincide with the
north's spring rainy season when the thick mud makes movement
difficult for the government's tanks and heavy artillery.

   Oil prices ended the week by slipping lower in
quiet trading.
   Analysts said most of Friday's activity involved traders trying
to square positions taken earlier in the week when prices ticked
upward. Prices of both crude and refined products weakened as
traders sold contracts to take their profits, observers said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for July delivery
of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at
$17.50 per 42-gallon barrel, down 15 cents.
   Among July contracts for refined products, wholesale unleaded
gasoline settled down 0.62 cent at 50.89 cents a gallon, while
wholesale heating oil closed at 47.13 cents per gallon, off 0.25
cent.
   Traders remained reluctant to make large moves in the market
until they see what happens at the upcoming summer meeting of oil
ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The
conference opens June 11 in Vienna, Austria.
   ``The market is more bearish going into the OPEC meeting than
other recent meetings,'' said Richard Redoglia of Merrill Lynch
Energy Futures. ``But there is still a week to go, so there's not
much to worry about.''

<HEAD>Jobless Rate Posts First Rise of Year; Wall Street Gains</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: for Saturday PMs</NOTE>

   The stock and bond markets have gotten a boost from news that
the nation's unemployment rose for the first time this year to 5.6
percent in May.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that unemployment in May
increased 0.2 percentage point from April's 14-year-low civilian
jobless rate of 5.4 percent. The small May rise reflected a
seasonally adjusted shrinking of the U.S. labor force by 363,000
people, with 536,000 fewer Americans at work.
   Wall Street interpreted the figures as showing a little less
strength in the economy than had been anticipated, and thus serving
to dampen worries about inflation somewhat.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 18.85 points
Friday to 2,071.30, extending its gain for the week to 114.86
points. That surpassed the previous record weekly point rise of
108.26 set last Dec. 14-18, although it fell well short of some
past weekly percentage increases.
   Bond prices also rose in response to the jobless data, pushing
interest rates lower. The yield on the Treasury's closely watched
30-year bond dropped from 9.14 percent late Thursday to 9.04
percent _ its lowest level since late April.
   However, government officials and private economists cautioned
the job figures for last month are too unreliable to suggest the
economy is losing steam.
   In other economic developments Friday:
   _Auto companies reported sales of domestic cars and trucks
picked up in late May despite lower incentive offers and rose 14.8
percent over the same period a year earlier.
   _The broadest measure of Japan's trade surplus shrank 12.7
percent in April from its level of a year earlier as imports
climbed 30 percent to record levels, Japanese government figures
showed.
   Before the seasonal adjustments made in the government's jobless
survey, to reflect a historically burgeoning job market in May with
the end of school terms, the actual number of Americans working
increased by 317,000.
   A separate government survey of employer payrolls also showed
209,000 new jobs in May, down from an average net gain of 250,000
new jobs monthly over the past year but reflecting a still-tight
labor market.
   Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, said it would be premature to draw any conclusions from
the May change in the jobless rate based on her agency's household
survey.
   The unadjusted increase in May employment was very low by
historical standards, particularly when compared with a 1.3 million
rise the same month a year ago, Ms. Norwood told the congressional
Joint Economic Committee.
   Private economists agreed, and some even suggested the
unemployment rate may still be on a downward trend despite the
slight increase in May.
   ``You really can't identify a 0.2 percentage point move as a
change in the trend,'' said Chris Caton, an analyst for Data
Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``Next month it will probably go
down a tenth of a percent.''
