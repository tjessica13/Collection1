<HEAD>Proposal Would Withhold Federal Aid to Promote Anti-Drug War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is considering
withholding governmental benefits such as student loans and public
housing assistance to people convicted of drug use, according to a
published report.
   The Cabinet-level National Drug Policy Board, headed by Attorney
General Edwin Meese III, approved the proposals in outline form at a
meeting May 27, but they have not yet been presented to President
Reagan, The Washington Post reported in Wednesday's editions, citing
sources it did not identify.
   ``We're not trying to be Draconian _ we're not going to kick poor
people out of public housing...,'' the Post quoted one source as
saying. ``But at the same time, we're trying to encourage'' state
and local governments and colleges to adopt anti-drug programs that
will have ``maximum impact.''
   The proposals would seek to fight drug abuse by threatening to
withhold some federal aid to state and local governments, colleges
and universities and other publicly funded institutions that fail to
adopt strict, federally approved anti-drug programs, the sources
said.
   One proposal calls for state governments to refuse to issue
first-time drivers' licenses to minors who have been convicted of
drug use, and the federal government would enforce this by
threatening to withhold federal transportation funding, the Post
said.
   Various federal department and agencies were directed to study
the proposals and report back to Meese by Wednesday, the newspaper
said. One source told the Post that no objections had been raised
and that the proposals probably would be presented to Reagan within
the next few days.

   Michael S. Dukakis clinched the Democratic
presidential nomination on Tuesday night, assuring his victory on
the first ballot at the party's national convention, according to
the Associated Press delegate count.
   The Massachusetts governor exceeded the 2,081 delegate majority
as votes were being counted in the California primary. Earlier,
Dukakis picked up more than 100 delegates in winning the three other
final-day primaries in New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana.
   Dukakis began the day about 150 delegates short and was likely to
end the evening with about 2,200 delegates in the AP count. On
Wednesday, he expected to pick up more delegates and the
endorsements of two former rivals.
   George Bush mathematically clinched the Republican nomination in
winning the Pennsylvania primary in April.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson staged what was to have
been a celebratory appeal for votes on the final night of the
California primary campaign, but the half-hour show was botched when
the presidential candidate got stuck in traffic and missed half of
it.
   Jackson arrived 16 minutes into the half-hour broadcast, which
originated at Los Angeles station KTLA and shown throughout the
state at a cost of $150,000.
   Jackson fell behind schedule on campaign appearances in San
Francisco earlier in the the day, then got tied up in traffic jams
trying to get to the San Francisco airport.
   The show opened with rock disc jockey Casey Kasem, a Jackson
supporter, announcing that the chair next to him was empty because
Jackson was on his way.
   The first half of the show was given over to a video montage of
Jackson campaign appearances.
   Kasem filled time waiting for Jackson by interviewing Chris
Hammond, Jackson's state campaign manager, producing some tortured
exchanges.
   Then came a second video montage, featuring some of the same
footage already shown. Finally, Jackson appeared.
   The candidate, appearing calm but his face glistening with
perspiration, talked about the issues that he has stressed in
California _ offshore oil drilling and environmental concerns as
well as devoting defense funding to peaceful application in space
and science instead.
   He also highlighted his anti-drug message and his call for an end
to gang warfare.
   Jackson told Kasem he had a ``day of big crowds, lots of
excitement, but mostly of touching people's hearts.''
   Earlier in the day, Jackson, shifting the focus toward thd
Democratic convention this summer, said Monday he will go to the
convention mat with Michael Dukakis unless the Democratic
front-runner comes around to his position on South Africa.
   Jackson accused Dukakis of proceeding too ``cautiously and
conservatively'' in refusing to agree with Jackson that South Africa
should be declared a terrorist nation.
   ``If he will not bend on that matter, we'll simply meet on the
floor at Atlanta,'' Jackson said during a call-in radio news
conference. The tough talk was the most pointed language Jackson has
used in discussing his intentions for the convention.
   ``The matter needs to be resolved in the committee or in platform
hearings or on the convention floor,'' he told reporters later.
   He indicated he will put up a fight for his platform issues but
will do so within the framework of party rules, leaving unclear just
how hard a bargain he will drive.
   ``We can resolve our differences within the context of our party
and not in the streets _ and that's growth,'' he said at one point.
   He also said that at the convention he would ``use the rules to
have fair rules'' _ a reference to his contention that the popular
vote is not fairly reflected in the delegate count and so
delegate-selection procedures should be changed.
   As for South Africa, Jackson contends the United States should
subject that nation to the trade sanctions applied to other
countries it has put on its terrorist list such as Libya, North
Korea and Cuba.
   ``By any definition of a terrorist state South Africa
qualifies,'' he said.
   Jackson said the Democratic convention ``will have a tremendous
impact on the priorities that the ticket will have. I'm convinced
the ticket will take a strong position against apartheid and declare
South Africa to be a terrorist state.''
   As to Dukakis, he said, ``Either the governor will offer
leadership on these basic issues or be wallowing in the wave of the
convention taking him out to sea.''
   ``It's not a question of integrity, it's a question of judgment
and priorities. And the governor, like all of us, will keep
expanding and keep growing,'' he said.
   Jackson indicated he will push for platform planks on cutting
back military spending and on shifting spending to housing, health
care and other social services.
   Although polls have shown Jackson consistently trailing Dukakis
in California, Jackson said the state ``can produce an upset
tomorrow if voters listen to their convictions rather than reports
of an inevitable Dukakis win.''
   In a philosophical vein, Jackson said he believes his candidacy
has helped America grow in racial tolerance. ``It's clear America
has become more and more accustomed to Jesse Jackson as a possible
next president. ... It's a matter of growth. I'm the stimulus. I'm
the catalyst for that growth.''

   Pirates are harassing boats off the eastern
seaboard of China for the first time since the Communists took over
the mainland in 1949, an official newspaper reported today.
   The China Daily said that in the past few weeks, pirates in the
East China Sea off the coast of Shanghai, Zhejiang province and
Fujian province have stolen the catches of fishing boats and
assaulted and kidnapped fishermen.
   The daily said the pirates have been armed with iron pipes,
explosives and detonators. It not say how many boats were involved
in pirating or indicate their origin.
   It did say, however, that six boats from a Fujian province county
had been seized in the past two months for illegal possession of
fish.

<TEXT>
   Police say they foiled the first attempt
of Colombia's `Medellin Cartel' drug barons to use Chile as a
transit point to send cocaine to the United States or Europe.
   The seizure of 22 pounds of pure cocaine worth $1.2 million on
the street was the biggest cocaine bust in Chile in 14 years, police
Maj. Jaime Rieutord said Monday.
   Two Colombians, Oscar Diaz Torres, 30, and Alberto Marquez, 42,
were arrested with the narcotic on Friday at a fashionable Santiago
hotel after arriving from Colombia, police said.
   The arrests were not immediately announced because police were
waiting for accomplices to pick up the drugs, but the accomplices
never showed, Rieutord said.
   Diaz Torres and Marquez admitted to belonging to the cartel named
after the city where it is based and ``said they were told to use
Santiago as a transit point because this city was not normally used,
and thus security could be less severe,'' the major said.
   Rieutord said cocaine traffickers had not used Chile as a transit
station for more than a decade.

   Sonnette, a rare French donkey who
narrowly escaped a government death sentence four years ago, is
expecting its first offspring.
   ``She looks like she swallowed a barrel. She looks like she wants
to have it any minute,'' said Sharon Vanderlip, who owns the donkey
with her husband, Jack Vanderlip.
   The Vanderlips, both veterinarians at the University of
California, San Diego, said Sonnette successfully mated with a
3-year-old of the same breed about a year ago and should deliver her
first foal later this month.
   Sonnette is one of four donkeys the Vanderlips imported to their
northern San Diego County farm from the Poitou region of France in
1984 and 1985.
   In 1984, federal agriculture inspectors almost put Sonnette, a
member of an endangered species, to death because the donkey failed
an equine blood test for communicable diseases.
   A public outcry ensued over the plans to destroy the animal, and
officials changed their mind when the Vanderlips and other experts
showed the test given wasn't suitable for a specialized variety such
as the Poitou donkey.
   A test designed for the rare donkey was then given to Sonnette
and it was released from quarantine after being certified as healthy
and free of disease. Since then, the Vanderlips have imported three
other rare Poitou donkeys, including the father-to-be, Tartarin.
   The Vanderlips hope to establish a herd to help the save the
breed from extinction. About 45 Poitou donkeys remain in existence,
said Mrs. Vanderlip, who learned about the species while studying
veterinary medicine in France several years ago.
   Sonnette has been separated from the other donkeys and will
remain alone with the foal until the baby is weaned at 4 months to 6
months of age. Tartarin also will be kept away from Sonnette as well
as the foal because male donkeys can become agitated around small
creatures and may even kill them, Mrs. Vanderlip said.

   Victoria Sellers, daughter of the late actor
Peter Sellers and actress Britt Ekland, has pleaded guilty to
violating her parole by using cocaine.
   Ms. Sellers, 23, had been ordered to undergo periodic testing for
drugs as a condition of her three-year probation in a New Jersey
drug conspiracy case. She pleaded guilty in that case in March 1987
to concealing a crime.
   In a federal court hearing in Los Angeles on Monday, Ms. Sellers
admitted diluting urine samples by drinking a lot of fluids, failing
to appear for tests and leaving the district without probation
approval, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Lincenberg. She will be
sentenced June 27.
   ``Right now she is being tested every day, according to the
probation officer,'' Lincenberg said.
   The U.S. Probation Office has indicated it will recommend that
the former Playboy model and actress be treated at a drug
rehabilitation program.
   Miss Sellers, a British citizen who lives in Los Angeles, already
has spent time in a rehabilitation program at St. John's Hospital in
Santa Monica, Lincenberg said.

   Talk show host Phil Donahue and his wife,
Marlo Thomas, have upset preservationists because the couple wants
to demolish a unique contemporary home on their property.
   Although an ordinance provides a three-month grace period for
structures over 50 years old, nothing is on the books to stop the
demolition of those built during the past 50 years.
   ``We want architecturally significant structures included in the
ordinance as well,'' said Lucinda McWeeney, chairwoman of a historic
survey of 400 Westport homes.
   The concrete house, built in 1963, is located on the shore at
Donahue's property. It was purchased for $6.8 million in March by
the couple, along with 7 acres and a guest house next to their $3.5
million Tudor home on 3.1 acres overlooking Long Island Sound.
   The couple bought the land adjoining their property to prevent
construction of a subdivision.
   The house is considered a landmark in modern architecture,
McWeeney said, and should be preserved for that reason.
   ``I'm sorry that these people whom I respect would suggest that
my only interest is the view,'' Donahue said. ``My main interest is
the security of my family and all the children who visit my home
during the summer.''

   Too many doctors hesitate to give good
advice about disease prevention and promotion of good health,
perhaps because they're preoccupied with high-tech medicine, U.S.
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said.
   ``We seem at times to be more interested in transplanting
diseased hearts and lungs than we are in teaching people not to
smoke in order to prevent heart and lung disease from occuring in
the first place,'' he said Monday.
   Koop, speaking to graduates of the Kirksville College of
Osteopathic Medicine, said doctors are under greater pressure to
slow down if not reverse the rising cost of health care _ sometimes
by making judgments based on cost rather than on the basis of good
medicine.

   Rising ocean levels will flood cities
and the climate will become hotter and more stormy unless
governments curb gas emissions that make the Earth an ever-warming
greenhouse, a group of scientists said.
   ``The problem here is 10 times or maybe 100 times more important
and more difficult'' than the thinning ozone layer, said Bert Bolin
of the World Meteorological Organization.
   The group Monday issued a report calling for coordinated planning
to prepare coastal defenses against floods, stop deforestation,
re-examine energy policies, cooperate to monitor and study
emissions, and to carry out the accord to halt the depletion of the
ozone layer recently signed in Montreal.
   The report said weather changes will make deserts hotter and
tropical storms more severe in the next few decades. It said rising
seas will threaten to flood coastal cities like New York and
endanger entire countries like the Netherlands and Bangladesh.
   Bolin said the scientists could not establish how the weather
changes would hit specific areas, but it was clear that ``climatic
problems will be part of people's lives over the next century.''
   The study was a follow-up to a 1985 conference of the
International Council of Scientific Unions at Villach, Austria,
which endorsed the theory that gases trap energy from the sun near
the Earth's surface, warming the atmosphere in a ``greenhouse
effect.''
   ``We are entering a new phase. We told the world what scientists
believe will be the case ... Now nations and politicians must start
to think about the problems,'' said Bolin, whose pioneering work on
the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer earned him this year's
$150,000 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement from the
University of Southern California.
   The report said the earth's average temperature will rise by at
least 0.54 to 1.44 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. In the tropics and
in the polar regions, the rise in temperature may reach as much as 9
degrees, the report said.
   The rising temperatures will melt polar ice packs in summer,
raising the sea level by 8 to 60 inches over the next 50 years, the
report said.
   At least 30 of the world's largest cities ``definitely will be
affected,'' said Jill Jaeger of the Beijer Institute of the Royal
Institute of the Academy of Sciences, who wrote the report.
   In the last 100 years the earth's average temperature has risen
nine-tenths of a degree and sea level has risen by four to 4.8
inches, she said.
   Even if emissions of dangerous gases were stopped immediately,
temperatures and the sea level would continue to rise at that rate
for another 100 years because of those gases already released in the
atmosphere, she said.
   The report said that among the effects, tropical storms will
become more frequent and hit wider areas. Patterns of rainfall, and
thus farming, will change. Fish migrations will shift. Evaporation
will increase, making water supplies scarcer in semi-arid zones.
Trees and animals may have difficulty reproducing and may be
threatened with extinction.
   Jaeger said more powerful storms could cause severe flooding in
Bangladesh, threating the lives or dislocation of 50 million people.
Floods could overwhelm the Nile Basin, where 10 million Egyptians
live.
   ``Roughly half of humanity lives close to the sea,'' she said.
The United States alone will have to spend up to $100 billion to
protect its eastern seaboard, she said.
   The changing climate also will have military implications as seas
become ice-free along the northern coasts of Europe, North America
and Siberia.
   ``If these coastlines become navigable, fundamental security
readjustments will be required,'' the report said.
   The report listed the ``greenhouse gases'' as carbon dioxide,
methane, chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide and tropospheric ozone.

<HEAD>D.C. Law School Dean Resigns Two Months After Being Selected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dean of the District of Columbia Law School
has resigned two months after his selection and three months before
classes are scheduled to begin, according to a published report.
   ``It was the most agonizing decision of my career,'' Frank N.
Jones told The Washington Post for a story in Tuesday's editions.
``My wife and family decided they really didn't want to move. It's
as simple as that.''
   Jones' resignation becomes effective June 15. He plans to return
to a private law practice in Boston, where he lives with his wife,
who is also an attorney, and two children.
   The resignation is the most recent in a series of setbacks that
have plagued the fledgling law school, created amid controversy over
whether the city should take over its predecessor, the failing
Antioch School of Law.
   Mayor Marion Barry and the board of directors of the University
of the District of Columbia, which is to assume control of the
school in two years, have opposed the takeover.
   Board chairman Frederick B. Abramson said Jones' resignation
``makes it difficult'' to continue the school's operations because
Jones was responsible for many of the start-up activities.
   The resignation also adds to the growing list of law school deans
in Washington and around the nation who have quit recently.
   In May, the law school deans at American University and
Georgetown University announced their resignations. Meanwhile,
George Washington University Law School named a new dean in April
and new deans have assumed positions at the law schools of Catholic
and Howard universities in the past two years. The George Mason
University law school in suburban Arlington, Va., also named a new
dean in the last two years.
   The American Bar Association has reported that 86 of the nation's
174 ABA-approved law schools hired new deans in the last three
years, and the average tenure has declined from six years to 3.2
years.

<TEXT>
   Crews filming scenes for a movie about
bat-wielding principal Joe Clark have disrupted classes and
graduation plans, but some students said the film also has generated
excitement.
   ``They moved our classes. So what, it doesn't mean they are going
to stop,'' said Francis Sousa, an Eastside High junior who is an
extra in the movie. ``Mostly the only reason you sit in class by now
is to go over your review sheets. Books have already been
collected.''
   Several students and parents have complained that Warner Bros.
crews filming ``Lean on Me'' forced a change in graduation sites,
Passaic County schools Superintendent Melindo Persi said Monday.
   Clark, who gained national attention for a get-tough approach to
education that includes wielding bullhorns and baseball bats in
hallways, could not be reached for comment. Calls left with his
secretary Monday were not returned.
   As the 97-member film crew built sets, sprayed graffiti over
lockers and filmed a scene with actor Robert Guillaume, students
hanging out after school said they saw only a positive impact from
the movie.
   Sophomore Kathy Lewis, an extra waiting to be called, said
students in the movie have been given plenty of time to do their
homework, and tutors are available if needed. She said she hopes to
parlay her movie appearance into greater roles in the future.
   ``I was excited because now there is a chance for us to be
noticed,'' she said.
   Some school officials, however, were worried there are too many
distractions at a time of year when important exams are held.
   ``My concern is just for the kids,'' said Donna Brightman, a
school board member. ``I'd like them to be able to take their exams
without a lot of commotion going on.''
   Persi sent the Paterson Board of Education a letter asking how
the filming of ``Lean on Me'' is affecting the school.
   In particular, he is asking about newspaper reports that physical
education classes have been canceled to let the film crew use the
gymnasium; that hallways are being blocked with film equipment; and
that regular instruction rooms have been sacrificed for the movie.
   Producer Norman Twain, who began filming Wednesday, said his
crew's presence will have few negative academic effects.
   ``Sure, it's a little more crowded in the hallways,'' Twain said.
``This is the time of year when everybody starts `short-timing'
anyhow. Just come over here and see the exodus at noontime.''
   Twain acknowledged causing a change in graduation plans, and
attributed it to the artistic preferences of director John Avildsen.
   Avildsen had planned to film the ceremony but because of
aesthetic concerns, persuaded the school to move the location to
Baurele Field from the original and larger site, Hinchcliffe Stadium.
   Two weeks ago, Avildsen decided not to film the graduation. At
that point, another school had reserved the stadium for June 24,
forcing Eastside to change its graduation date to June 25.

<HEAD>Complaints Drop, While Airline On-Time Performance Improves</HEAD>

   The number of airline complaints to the
government was the lowest in 15 months in May and air carriers also
recorded their best on-time performances, according to the
Transportation Department.
   The department said Monday that its consumer affairs office
received 36 percent fewer complaints from airline passengers than
during the same month in 1987. For the first time since February
1987, the number of complaints dipped below the 2,000 level at 1,820.
   In April, the latest month for which there was on-time
information available, the 14 largest airlines had 82.6 percent of
their flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule, compared with
78.8 percent in March, the department said.
   The April figures were the best since the department began
monitoring on-time performance last September and in part reflected
good weather during the month, officials said.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley issued a statement saying
that the latest on-time and consumer statistics indicate ``that our
attempt to instill greater accountability into the (aviation) system
seems to have made a substantial difference.''
   America West had the best performance during April with a 90.8
percent on-time arrival rate, followed by Southwest Airlines at 90.3
percent. Pacific Southwest Airlines reported a 91.1 percent on-time
rate, but that covered only the first eight days of the month before
its operations were incorporated into USAir as a result of last
year's merger.
   Eastern Airlines, which has been plagued by labor tensions, had
the worst on-time arrival rate among the 14 airlines, with 75.5
percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule. Pan
American World Airways reported a 76.5 percent on-time mark.
   The airlines also misplaced fewer bags during April with 6.53
baggage complaints for every 1,000 passengers flown, compared with
7.48 reports the previous month and 11.83 reports in January. The
April figures for mishandled bags were also the best since the
consumer statistics began being compiled last September.
   The number of passengers bumped from flights because of
overbooking also declined. There were 3.71 passenger for every
10,000 boardings involuntarily bumped during April, compared with
5.46 passengers during the first three months of the year, the
department said.
   Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines, both owned by Texas
Air Corp., had the highest complaint rate in May with 11.43
complaints for every 100,000 passengers who flew on Continental and
10.34 complaints from every 100,000 people on Eastern.
   While the number of complaints involving Continental was more
than any other airline it represented a sharp improvement over a
year ago when the department received more than 21 complaints per
100,000 travelers on Continental. Northwest Airlines, which until
recently had consistently been among the airlines with high
complaint rates, also showed continued improvement with only 3.22
complaints for every 100,000 passengers flown in May.
   Southwest Airlines, Aloha Airlines and Air Wisconsin had the best
complaint record with less than 1 complaint for every 100,000
passengers flown. Delta Air Lines had the fewest complaints among
the large carriers at 1.32 per 100,000 passengers.
   The best arrival rate was reported at Salt Lake City, where 90.6
percent of the flights arrived on time during April, followed by
86.7 percent at Memphis and Phoenix. San Francisco had the worst
arrival record at 68.4 percent.
   The department tabulates on-time information for the 27 largest
airports based on passenger traffic volume.
   The April on-time statistics are made public at the same time as
the May consumer complaint statistics, although the two sets of
statistics cover different months.

   Edward Schaumberg Quade, a founder of
the methodical problem-solving method known as ``systems analysis,''
died Saturday. He was 79.
   Quade joined the research organization when it was founded in
1948 and retired in 1973. His 1968 book, ``Systems Analysis and
Policy Planning: Applications in Defense,'' defined systems analysis
as ``a systematic approach to helping a decision-maker choose a
course of action by investigating his full problem, searching out
objectives and alternatives, and comparing them in the light of
their consequences.''
   Quade's books applied systems analysis to military problems and
later to broader public policy issues.

<HEAD>FDA Approves New Wart Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new treatment is available for the estimated
8 million Americans who suffer each year from genital warts.
   The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it has
OK'd direct injection of genetically engineered alpha interferon
into the warts.
   The FDA said a study of 192 patients showed they exhibited marked
improvement after receiving interferon injections three times a week
for up to three weeks.
   Of the 192, 42 percent experienced complete clearing of all their
treated warts, 24 percent had a 75 percent to 99 percent reduction
in the size of their treated warts and 18 percent had a 50 percent
to 74 percent reduction in the size of their treated warts, the FDA
said.
   Previously, the most effective treatments were painful and
potentially scarring removal by freezing or burning.
   Some types of genital warts can be treated with direct
application of conventional anti-infective drugs, but this treatment
often is not effective.
   Alpha interferon was first approved in June 1986 as a treatment
for hairy cell leukemia _ a rare form of leukemia.
   Although the presence of genital warts is more distressing than
health-threatening, some studies have suggested there could be a
relationship in women between the warts and later development of
cervical cancer.
   Adverse reactions experienced during clinical trials were mild
flu-like symptoms. The drug is not recommended for use in pregnant
women since animal studies have shown the treatment may cause
abortions.
   Schering Corp. of Kenilworth, N.J., will market the alpha
interferon treatment under the Intron-A brand name.

   Nancy Reagan sat quietly in Moscow's Spaso
House last week, waiting for her husband to arrive for a news
conference.
   Since President Reagan's wife has rarely attended such events, a
reporter called on her to answer a few questions.
   With a giggle and a grin, the first lady demurred, saying, ``I
only rescue people.''
   The first lady's response drew a peal of laughter from reporters
_ who realized she was referring to a hectic scene several days
earlier when she'd reached out to pluck a hapless reporter loose
from the over-eager clutches of the KGB.
   In a number of ways, Mrs. Reagan's first visit to the Soviet
Union cast her in a defender's role.
   Although it seemed odd for a woman who rarely goes to church,
Mrs. Reagan used several events during the visit to make subtle
points about religious freedom.
   During a visit to the Kremlin's Assumption Cathedral _ nowadays a
museum _ the first lady questioned her guide and Raisa Gorbachev
about its use for religious services and the celebration of the
1,000-year anniversary of the founding of Christendom in Russia.
   She got only curt responses from the Soviet first lady, but Mrs.
Reagan pursued the topic again several days later.
   Upon viewing an icon named, ``The Trinity,'' during a tour of the
famed Tretyakov Gallery, she told Mrs. Gorbachev she'd arrived in
the Soviet Union on Trinity Sunday. Again, little response.
   At another point, the first lady was told that before she'd come,
Mrs. Gorbachev had spoken at length about the icons but failed to
mention their relgious meaning.
   ``I don't know how you can neglect the religious implications,''
Mrs. Reagan insisted. ``I mean, they are there, when you see them.''
   The first lady's propaganda points on behalf of religious freedom
were accompanied by a few propaganda points on her own behalf, as
well.
   Left smarting after her Washington summit encounters with the
well-spoken and photogenic Mrs. Gorbachev, Mrs. Reagan at first
appeared intent on showing how to play the polite and well-mannered
guest.
   So, it seemed, a peace pact of the magnitude of the Treaty of
Westphalia had been reached.
   The two women held hands, European style, as they toured the
Kremlin cathedral on the first day of the visit .
   And afterwards, Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman Elaine Crispen relayed
quotes from a private afternoon tea in which the two pooh-poohed the
``silly'' idea that there was any rivalry between them.
   But it didn't last.
   By Wednesday, when they toured the Tretyakov Gallery, their
equally strong wills collided as they jockeyed for position in front
of the cameras.
   Mrs. Gorbachev offered reporters a ``dialogue,'' displaying her
opinions of the priceless artwork, going so far as to quote Russian
author Feodor Dostoevsky on their beauty and how they reflected the
Russian soul.
   This time, Mrs. Reagan appeared ready for the assertive Mrs.
Gorbachev, insisting she be granted equal time. She then made her
thanks known to everyone, and chatted a bit with reporters about her
experiences.
   Mrs. Gorbachev backed away, allowing the first lady to have her
say.
   But if body language is a barometer, judge the seating chart that
evening _ when the two men sat next to each other in the front row
of the Bolshoi's Royal Box and their ladies sat on the outside _ as
far apart from each other as they could be and contrary to normal
practice at such events.
   But at the Reagan's departure, there were smiles and waves all
around.
   Perhaps it is the last time the two women will meet and it really
isn't necessary that they be friends.
   Given Mrs. Reagan's newfound ability _ as her spokeswoman says _
``to roll with the punches,'' it's clear Mrs. Gorbachev has
discovered she must allow for the moment when a U.S. first lady
insists she be allowed her own ``dialogue.''
   And through their words and appearances, each first lady has
become adept at getting a message across, not only at home, but to
their counterpart's homeland as well.

   Sen. Lowell Weicker's forecast of Senate action
on President Reagan's Persian Gulf policy is simple: ``Let me
predict when the next great debate will occur _ when the next great
tragedy occurs in the Persian Gulf.''
   The statement by the Connecticut Republican came Monday afternoon
as the Senate again sidestepped the issue of whether to require
Reagan to invoke the War Powers Act and defend his policy under
terms of the controversial 1973 law.
   As Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said, ``this is not the first time,
it's not the second time, it's not even the third time. ... It's the
umpteenth time'' the Senate debated the issue since the May 17,
1987, attack by Iraq on the USS Stark killed 37 sailors.
   The Senate has been unable to decide the question once and for
all because it is divided both on the war powers law and on the
separate question of Reagan's Persian Gulf policy, senators noted
during Monday's debate.
   The War Powers Act was approved by Congress over the veto of
President Nixon, who argued it was an unconstitutional restriction
on his power. All succeeding presidents, including Reagan, have
agreed with that point of view.
   The act requires a report from the White House within 48 hours
after U.S. military personnel are sent into areas of ``imminent
hostilities'' and, under some circumstances, requires them to be
withdrawn within 60 or 90 days unless Congress says they can remain.
   Reagan's policy involves reflagging 11 Kuwaiti tankers and
protecting them with U.S. Navy warships in the gulf, scene of
fighting in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. Kuwait is an ally of Iraq.
   Six weeks ago, the U.S. mantle of protection was extended to
neutral ships that ask for help from the U.S. warships.
   Monday's vote in the Senate was a 54-31 decision to keep a
resolution invoking the War Powers act off the top of the chamber's
agenda. Although Democrats hold a 54-46 advantage in the chamber,
the issue cuts across political lines.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., summed up one view
of the dilemma Monday. On one hand, he said, ``the policy of
escorting, of convoying, Kuwaiti ships is not a good one, but that's
the policy we're following.'' On the other, Byrd said, the War
Powers Act ``is an unworkable law.''
   Byrd and other Senate leaders have introduced a bill to overhaul
the act by eliminating the 60-day withdrawal period.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., disagreed that the War Powers law is
unwieldy and offered a different reason for Senate inaction. ``If we
choose to make it work, it'll work, but we don't have the gumption
to make it work,'' he said.
   Weicker agreed. ``There seems to be the inability by Congress to
stand up to presidents,'' he said.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said the Senate is afraid to take a
stand on Reagan's policy and ``our silence is our complicity.''
   ``If the policy appears to be a success, we can issue statements
praising it, but if it appears to be out of hand, we can issue
criticisms,'' he explained.
   The War Powers law was written in response to the Vietnam War and
reflected a desire by Congress to take back some of the power ceded
to the executive branch during America's longest war.
   Senators have noted that the Constitution gives Congress, not the
president, the power to declare war. But the Vietnam conflict was
fought without a declaration of war and the modern reality most
often features murky U.S. military deployments such as the Persian
Gulf and Reagan's deployment of U.S. Marines to Lebanon for a
peacekeeping mission. The latter ended shortly after 241 servicemen
were killed by a terrorist truck bomb.
   ``Congress will probably never again declare war,'' said Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., referring to that reality.
   The War Powers law and Reagan's Persian Gulf policy are also
involved in a related federal court fight.
   Last year, 115 legislators, frustrated at the congressional
inability to act, filed suit in federal court seeking an order
requiring Reagan to invoke the law. That challenge was turned down,
but the legislators are appealing and say they will pursue their
case to the Supreme Court.
   Helms thinks the law will eventually be struck down by the
nation's highest court. ``Once it hits the Supreme Court, they're
going to throw it out like a tub of lard, because it is
unconstitutional,'' he said.

   Balloonist Per Lindstrand soared more than
10 miles to set an unofficial altitude record, but had to crawl
outside his pressurized gondola at 22,000 feet and wield a pocket
knife to release stubborn sandbags.
   Lindstrand on Monday reached 59,700 feet, easily surpassing the
55,137-foot record set in 1980, but fell short of his goal of 60,000
feet in his butane- and solar-powered ``Stratoquest'' hot-air
balloon, project coordinator Peter Mason said.
   The 12-story-high craft took off into a clear sky, but was
hampered by two 200-pound sandbags that failed to release
automatically.
   ``There was no way I could make the altitude record while
carrying this sand,'' said the 39-year-old Lindstrand. `` So I had
to climb out of the capsule and cut them.''
   The first bag was no problem because it was near the hatch, but
the second was on the other side of the craft beyond the reach of
his oxygen line.
   ``I had to take a deep breath, run around, cut it off and run
back again, all the while clinging on to the outside of the
capsule,'' he said. ``That got a bit hairy.
   ``There were a few white knuckles when I was climbing around
there,'' he said.
   Linstrand figures the sandbag problem cost him about 5,000 feet
in potential altitude.
   ``It was a fairly average day, I think,'' Lindstrand said
jokingly. ``We had a particular problem with the sandbags, but
nothing my trusty Swiss Army knife couldn't handle.''
   Last year, Lindstrand and British millionaire Richard Brandson
set another record when they became the first ever to cross the
Atlantic in a hot air balloon. The two hold balloon records for
speed, 100 mph; duration, 31 hours and 41 minutes, and distance,
3,075 miles, from that flight.

<HEAD>Farm Wives Lash Back at Critics of Pesticide Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concern over the hazards of chemical pesticides
has gone too far, according to members of a farm women's
organization meeting in the nation's capital.
   ``We feed our families with the food we grow; we're not going to
feed them poison,'' says Mildred Brown of Hale Center, Texas.
   She is here for the sixth annual Washington meeting of Women
Involved in Farm Economics, an organization that brings together
farm women from across the country to wrestle with agricultural
issues.
   The group frequently has focused on the intricacies of world
markets for farm commodities and federal payment programs. But
pressure for congressional action on the pesticide issue prompted an
environmental seminar as well this year.
   Many crops produced in the United States and overseas are sprayed
with pesticides, some of which the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency has linked with cancer and other serious health problems.
   The two speakers at the farm women's session were representatives
of industries that have been major targets of environmental
criticism.
   Jack Early, president of the National Agricultural Chemical
Association, focused on pesticides, while, Vickie Sullivan, a
legislative analyst with a utility company, discussed the acid rain
issue.
   Early said he doubted that regulatory legislation recently
produced by the Senate Agriculture Committee would be sent to the
president's desk this year.
   He said so many loose ends remain to be tied up in other
committees that it will be ``close to impossible to get all these
things pulled together.''
   ``To do all that before Congress goes home and tries to get
re-elected _ and they will do that earlier this year _ I just don't
think you can get it all done this year,'' he said.
   His organization is supporting the Agriculture Committee's bill
but is opposing separate legislation cosponsored by Agriculture
Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., and Sen. David
Durenberger, R-Minn.
   It would impose stringent standards for clean groundwater, which
provides the major supply of drinking water for millions of
Americans but has in some areas been found to be laced with
pesticides.
   There may be an effort to attach the Leahy-Durenberger plan to
the Agriculture Committee's blueprint for revising the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.
   After the session, a number of members of the farm women's group
agreed to discuss their attitudes toward pesticides at an impromptu
roundtable discussion.
   Alice Parker, the group's president, recalled how she drove into
a farmers market near her home town of Royal City, Wash., not long
ago with a truckload of vegetables. Nearby another farmer was
parked, advertising that his vegetables were organically grown _
without the use of pesticides.
   Customers were interested at first, she says. But that changed.
   ``He had on his truck ``organicially grown'' and as soon as they
found the worms on his vegetables, they walked away,'' she recalled.
   ``They want absolutely perfect products and we have supplied them
with them,'' said Naioma Benson of Sterling, Colo., a wheat and
cattle producer.
   Environmentalists, she said, ``are not looking at the total, full
picture'' and often have ``a biased and slanted view.'' The notion
that farmers are poisoning the land with toxic chemicals is absurd,
she said.
   ``Our families depend on it. Our futures and our childrens'
futures depend on it.''
   ``My husband really respects the chemicals and is very careful
how he uses them,'' said Merlina Tate of Almira, Wash. She also
recalled a trip to the Soviet Union last year to inspect irrigation
systems used in that country. She saw ``beautiful vegetables'' grown
there without benefit of pesticides.
   ``But those same vegetables would not be bought in a U.S.
store,'' she said. The reason? Too many flaws caused by pests.
   The women condemned the notion that U.S. law should attempt to
eliminate all risk from the use of pesticides.
   Instead, they said, pesticide use should be likened to the use of
certain drugs that are beneficial in treating illnesses but
sometimes have side effects, or to automobiles, which are certain to
mean highway fatalities but provide vital transportation.
   They also pointed the finger at pesticides banned here that are
being used overseas on crops that are then brought into this country.
   ``They're being used in Mexico and hauled across the border,''
said Clara Jo Spivey, a Louisville, Ala., cotton and peanut grower.

   A Farm Belt senator clashed with administration
officials after they rejected both his bill to increase the nation's
commitment to agricultural research and similar recommendations from
an Agriculture Department task force.
   ``You're rejecting the recommendations of your own task force,''
Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said Monday after USDA voiced opposition
to the proposals.
   The bill would set up an independent corporation to make research
grants and provide federal funding for it. The price tag envisioned
by Conrad would be $100 million. The task force recommended $1
billion.
   Robert W. Long, USDA deputy assistant secretary for science and
education, made clear that the department was opposed.
   ``We do disagree with the amount that was involved and we do
disagree with the mechanisms that were involved, and that's our
privilege as it was their privilege to make those recommendations,''
Long said.
   USDA already supports a sizeable, government-operated
agricultural research program, and Long said Conrad's legislation
would add a new layer of bureaucracy. He also said the
administration would not back research grants that could not be
reviewed by the secretary of agriculture.

<HEAD>Delegates Flock To Dukakis As He Heads Over The Top</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis closed to within 200 delegates
of locking up the Democratic presidential nomination even before the
first votes were counted in today's season-ending primaries, boosted
by a surge of about 180 in the last week.
   Dukakis picked up 75 of those new delegates on Monday alone, some
prodded into declaring their support by his campaign staff and
others attracted by the near-gravitational force that surrounds a
winner.
   ``He's been on a roll,'' said Susan Brophy, deputy director of
delegate selection for the Dukakis campaign.
   ``He's shown election success week after week after week,'' she
said. ``It casts a very favorable light on Mike Dukakis.''
   Much of the surge came courtesy of ``super delegates,'' the party
leaders and elected officials who have heavily favored Dukakis, to
the chagrin of Jesse Jackson.
   The Massachusetts governor also has been converting delegates who
had been pledged to the suspended candidacies of Sens. Albert Gore
Jr. and Paul Simon.
   On Monday, Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, a staunch supporter
of Gore, switched to Dukakis and brought the bulk of his state's
65-member delegation with him. This came two days after Wilkinson
said he would continue to support Gore.
   And in Arizona on Monday, Gov. Rose Mofford and four other
``super delegates'' moved to Dukakis from the uncommitted ranks,
where they had been since former Gov. Bruce Babbitt dropped out of
the presidential race.
   By its own estimates, the Dukakis campaign has moved within
striking distance of the 2,081 delegates needed to clinch the
nomination. With fewer than 200 delegates to go, the campaign
expects to take at least 280 of the 466 delegates at stake in
today's primaries in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana.
   The intensity of the operation to contact and win delegates has
picked up as the primary season draws to a close. Delegates are told
that ``the governor would appreciate it very much if they would get
into the count earlier rather than later,'' Ms. Brophy said.
   ``The goal of all of this is to take the pressure off Dukakis
after June 7 so he can go about the process of building a coalition
for the general election,'' she said.
   Another incentive is the memory of 1984, when Walter Mondale
finished the final round of primaries without enough delegates to
lock up the nomination and spent an extra day pleading with a
handful of delegates to put him over the top.
   Some members of Dukakis' staff, including delegate chief Tad
Devine, worked for Mondale four years ago.
   Of the 178 delegates moved into the Dukakis column in the last
week, roughly half were super delegates, the party leaders and
politicians who automatically hold seats at the convention, and the
rest were delegates picked through the primaries and caucuses who
had been uncommitted or pledged to other candidates.
   ``I think that the advantage that we have is that we have been on
the phones with these people so long and there is a real strong bond
between some of these people and the campaign,'' Ms. Brophy said.
   By Monday, Dukakis held support from more than 321 of the 643
super delegates, while Jackson was backed by just 54, of whom 42 are
black, according to The Associated Press delegate count.
   Jackson has complained that the super delegates have
disproportionately favored Dukakis and hinted he may challenge the
rules that created them. He also has indicated he may launch a
convention challenge against the rules that allow some states to
pick other delegates in a manner that does not reflect the results
of the states' primaries.

<HEAD>Robert Kennedy Remembered 20 Years Later as Father, National Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the dusk of a spring evening, with his
family gathered before the simple cross that marks his grave, Robert
F. Kennedy was remembered as a father who guided his children with
love and understanding and as a public figure who was ``always ready
to stop and reach out to others.''
   Tourists mingled with friends and aides of the New York senator
Monday evening at a Mass of remembrance for Kennedy, who was shot by
an assassin 20 years ago as he left a Los Angeles celebration of his
victory in the 1968 California presidential primary.
   ``I invite you to join us in renewing the commitment that was his
life, his spirit and his hope,'' said Matthew Kennedy, who was not
yet 3{ years old when his father died.
   It was the first time the Kennedy family had invited outsiders to
take part in a memorial service. All 10 surviving children had a
brief part in the service. The 11th child, David Anthony Kennedy,
was found dead of a drug overdose in West Palm Beach, Fla., in April
1984.
   His widow, Ethel Kennedy, arrived on the arms of her
brother-in-law, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. She did not speak at the
service, but she told NBC News in a taped interview that her husband
``brought us all along with his enthusiasm ... his love of life ...
his curiosity.''
   ``He made everybody feel a part of this battle, that we're going
to do better, that America can stand for something,'' she said.
   Robert Kennedy's grave _ only a few steps from the more ornate
site where his brother, President John F. Kennedy, is buried _ was
unadorned for the service but an altar was set up nearby for the
Mass. In front was a box with 400-500 pink Eveline roses ordered by
Ethel Kennedy.
   Six choirs sang and the United States Navy band played. Andy
Williams sang ``Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory,'' as he did on the
night Robert Kennedy was buried.
   The sun was setting over the cemetery as the service began and as
it ended, the crowd lighted candles that had been handed to them as
they entered. The flickering lights cast a soft glow as John F.
Kennedy Jr. read a Shakespearean quotation his uncle often recited:
   ``When he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars,
and he will make the face of heaven so fine _ that all the world
will be in love with night, and pay no worship to the garish sun.''
   The youngest Kennedy child, daughter Rory, had not yet been born
at the time of her father's death. Now 19 and a freshman at Brown
University, she quoted from a speech her father delivered in Indiana
in 1968: ``Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so
many years ago, to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the
life of the world.''
   ``Robert Kennedy was always ready to stop and reach out to
others,'' said Joseph P. Kennedy II, the oldest son, who is a
congressman from Massachusetts.
   He recalled how his father, tired after a week in Washington,
would return to their seaside home in Hyannisport, Mass., and make
it a point to speak with each of the children about their week.
   ``He was deeply responsive to others, especially those who were
needy and vulnerable,'' Joseph Kennedy said.
   Robert, a 34-year-old son who bears his father's name, asked the
crowd for a moment's prayer for a policeman who was struck and
critically injured by a motorist as the Kennedy motorcade was making
its way to the service.
   Courtney Kennedy Ruhe, 31, a fund-raiser for the RFK Foundation,
quoted from a speech that the former senator gave during the Oregon
primary campaign in 1968 a week before he was assassinated.
   ``Perhaps this world will always be a world in which children
suffer,'' she recited. ``But we can reduce the number of suffering
children and if you don't help us, who will?''
   The other Kennedy children who took part in the mass were
Kathleen Townsend, 36, who heads a Maryland youth corps program and
was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress; Joe, 35; Robert Jr., 34,
who teaches environmental law at Pace University;
   Michael, 30, who heads Citizens Energy Corp. in Boston; Mary, 28,
who runs RFK Center for Human Rights in Boston; Christopher, 24, who
works for the family-owned Merchandise mart in Chicago; Matthew, 23,
a senior at Harvard; Douglas, 21, a sophomore at Boston College; and
Rory, 19, a freshman at Brown.
   The gathering included some important names from the Kennedy era,
such as Ted Sorensen, a top aide and biographer to both Kennedy
brothers; Byron White, a Supreme Court justice appointed by John F.
Kennedy and former Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson who was
with Kennedy when he was shot.
   Neither Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis nor her daughter, Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg, attended the service.
   Robert Kennedy was shot by Sirhan Sirhan and mortally wounded
shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, after he had addressed a
crowd of supporters gathered in the Ambassador Hotel to celebrate
his election victory of the day before. The senator, then 42, died
the next day.
   The Jordanian-born assassin, who said he did not know what drove
him to the deed, still is in prison.

   Two dozen contestants tried their charms on Carmen,
but a 4-year-old boy was the only one able to spark the interest of
the 5-foot-long boa constrictor.
   ``I can make a sound like a snake,'' Cole Anglin said as he
looked into the serpent's eyes. ``I can. Listen. Ssssssssssssss.''
   Carmen slithered with interest. Cole backed away.
   The boy was declared the winner of the Dallas Zoo's
snake-charming contest because he was the only one able to coax
Carmen into moving. He won a certificate worth $40 at a restaurant.
   Others tried to tempt the snake from her wooden perch Sunday, but
Carmen turned them down cold.
   Gordhan Patel, a 51-year-old hospital worker who successfully
sweet-talked Carmen last year, wasn't able to repeat the feat.
   Perhaps it was because Patel used the same line: ``You like
pizza? Spaghetti? Oh, you like the birds _ chicken.''
   Nicky Waters, 11, tried to make Carmen flinch. ``Look out,
there's a truck,'' Nicky said. When that didn't work, he tried,
``How about a fat, juicy rat?''
   Each competitor was allowed one minute to stand before Carmen,
and try to coax it into motion. Three judges gauged audience and
serpent reaction.
   The contest was part of the zoo's ``Snakes of the Metroplex''
weekend, an exhibit of snakes indigenous to the region. Boa
constrictors like Carmen, however, in the wild live in Central and
South America.
   The event presents the good side of snakes, which have been
slapped with a bad reputation ``since Adam and Eve,'' said zoo
spokeswoman Victoria Furber.

   A physics professor set a world record in a
corker of an event.
   Heinrich Medicus on Sunday opened a bottle of champagne to launch
a cork 177 feet and 9 inches, beating the mark set last year of more
than 68 feet at Kensington, England's Oval Cricket Grounds.
   A land surveyor used laser equipment to measure the shot, and a
wine expert testified that the bottles of champagne used were
undoctored.
   Medicus, a professor at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute in Troy,
plans to send the results to the Guiness Book of World Records.
   The victory was especially sweet for Medicus, whose much-heralded
attempt to break the record at the Saratoga Polo Club Grounds last
year literally fizzled.

<HEAD>Dukakis Nears Nomination; Jackson Prods Him on South Africa</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 7th graf pvs with Jackson-Dukakis meeting</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>

   Michael Dukakis converted dozens of delegates to his cause on
Monday and said he was looking forward to clinching the Democratic
presidential nomination in Tuesday's final round of primaries. Jesse
Jackson bought half an hour of television time to make a live
primary-eve appeal for votes in California, but got caught in
traffic and missed half of the show.
   Vice President George Bush, who wrapped up the Republican
nomination weeks ago, said in California that he expects to find
himself differing increasingly with administration policy as the
campaign goes on.
   ``We'll probably be dragged into more and more of these things
rather than less,'' he said at a news conference where he was asked
about one such difference, his advocacy of a delay in an offshore
oil lease.
   The oil-lease issue became moot Monday night, however, when
Interior Secretary Donald Hodel abruptly suspended plans to proceed
with a controversial drilling project off Northern California.
   Hodel's primary-eve move followed Bush's call for a delay in the
project. Both Dukakis and Jackson oppose the offshore drilling, and
the issue has been an important one in environmentally sensitive
California.
   Jackson, meanwhile, spent a busy last day of campaigning before
the election _ so busy that he got tied up in traffic and arrived 16
minutes late for a half-hour live broadcast that was supposed to be
a dramatic final appeal for votes. The television time for the show,
broadcast throughout the state, cost $150,000.
   Rock disc jockey Casey Kasem, a Jackson supporter, filled the
time while waiting for Jackson with an interview with a Jackson
campaign official and video montages.
   Jackson said after the show he planned a meeting with Dukakis
late Monday night at Jackson's hotel.
   Dukakis' aides have confidently predicted for weeks their man
would amass the 2,081 delegates needed for the nomination by the
time the primaries ended. And with one day remaining until then,
they were leaving nothing to chance.
   The Massachusetts governor picked up more than 70 delegates
during the day, increasing his total to 1,874. That left less than
200 short of the total needed, and aides said he would pick up that
many and more from the 466 at stake in primaries in California, New
Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.
   Dukakis was also preparing to pick up endorsements on Wednesday
from former rivals Rep. Richard Gephardt and Sen. Paul Simon,
campaign sources said. Dukakis was to stop off in Gephardt's home
state of Missouri to formally receive the congressman's backing. And
Simon was to make an endorsement statement in Washington, without
Dukakis present, the sources said.
   ``This has been a great 15 months. I'm excited about what
happened and I'm looking forward, if all goes well, to a decisive
victory ... so we can lock up the nomination,'' Dukakis said as he
campaigned in California.
   An ABC News tracking poll released Monday night suggested Dukakis
had a 2-1 lead over Jackson in California. The survey indicated he
had the of 61 percent of those surveyed, to 30 percent for Jackson.
   The figures, from sampling of 415 voters done over the weekend,
represented a slight gain for Dukakis. The poll's margin of error
was 6 percentage points.
   More than 40 of Dukakis' fresh delegates came from Kentucky,
where Gov. Wallace Wilkinson led the way. Wilkinson and many other
delegates there had been supporting drop-out candidate Albert Gore
Jr.
   Jackson still spoke of chances for a California upset as he made
the final rounds of his campaign and arranged a 30-minute paid
televised appeal in several of the state's large cities. But his
talked turned increasingly to the pre-convention bargaining that
lies ahead.
   He said he would push Dukakis to stop moving ``cautiously and
conservatively'' and to use the party platoform to take a stronger
stand against South Africa. ``If he will not bend on that matter,
we'll simply meet each other on the floor'' at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, he said.
   Jackson, who finished first or second in dozens of primaries and
caucuses, said he wanted changes in party rules, as well,
particularly those dealing with selection of delegates in future
campaigns.
   In all he said, however, Jackson also was careful to add, ``We
can resolve our differences within the contest of our party and not
in the streets, and that's growth.''
   He said, ``I intend to keep building our party, keep expanding
participation, keep registering voters, keep encouraging people to
be involved.''
   Dukakis sounded anything but upset at Jackson's talk.
   ``I know how strongly he feels about the importance of a Democrat
in the White House next January,'' he said.
   Of Jackson's position on South Africa, the governor said: ``I
don't think it's going to be a problem...I'm for tougher sanctions.
I hope it's going to be in our platform, and I don't see where this
is going to be a division in our party or our country.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner also jabbed at Bush on the
subject of off-shore oil drilling. The vice president, staking out a
difference with Reagan administration policy, said on Sunday he
favors a delay in a controversal drilling project off the coast of
northern California.
   Said Dukakis: ``I'm pleased he's coming around, but it's kind of
late. I'm not for delaying that sale. I'm for canceling it.''
   Bush told a Republican audience in California on Monday night
that he has major differences with Dukakis on a range of issues.
   He criticized the Massachusetts governor for failing to support
the death penalty for big-time drug traffickers, over a
prisoner-furlough program in Massachusetts and on arms control
matters.
   Pointing to the recent U.S.-Soviet INF treaty, the vice president
said: ``If we'd listened to Dukakis and Jackson, we wouldn't have
made any progress at all.''

<DATELINE>MOUNT MADISON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One hundred years ago, the Appalachian
Mountain Club took $770 in donations and built a wood and stone
cabin just above the timberline in the shadow of Mount Washington.
   Madison Spring Hut, an oasis for hikers 4,800 feet above sea
level between Mount Madison and Mount Adams, was the first of a
series of rustic cabins that have been a model for wilderness
shelters as far away as Alaska.
   Over the weekend, former workers and patrons held a reunion at
that hut.
   Madison started out providing solid meals, a bed and wool blanket
and first aid to hikers in the Presidential Range, which includes
Washington and is known for some of the harshest weather in the
world.
   As Madison enters its 100th season, the mission and the weather
haven't changed _ Monday's forecast called for possible snow
flurries and wind up to 90 mph. But now there are eight huts
throughout the White Mountains accommodating the thousands of hikers
who flood in from Boston and other nearby urban areas.
   Madison's four-story bunk beds, which fill two small wood-paneled
bedrooms, are booked months in advance by backpackers. The central
dining room, with a picture window facing Mount Madison, seats 60.
   For the weekend gathering, opening the hut's centennial season of
providing ``hospitality in high places,'' the AMC invited hut
caretakers from as far back as the early 1920s to a nostalgic party
at the base of the mountains and a hike back to Madison.
   For some, it was a pilgrimage.
   Thomas Deans, a former AMC executive director, wistfully recalled
``the wind in my face, the aches in the shoulder when you take off a
pack _ a good ache _ the smell of oil and of boot grease.''
   Such sentiments were shared by most for whom the opportunity to
work in the wilderness more than compensated for low salaries and
long hours.
   ``Back then, we made $4 a week,'' said Robert Monahan, 80, who
worked at Pinkham Notch camp at the base of Mount Washington in 1924.
   The next summer, Monahan moved to another hut where his duties
included carrying 100-pound packs of food and supplies four miles
from a base camp several times a week.
   Today, though helicopters drop tons of supplies into huts twice
each season, packing still is the main source of fresh food. Pack
weights and sizes are the stuff of AMC hut legends, and they seemed
to grow as the weekend went on.
   ``I carried 165 pounds,'' said Cary Hill, a 1983 Madison hutman.
``There was a party and we needed a couple roasts and a watermelon.''
   On Sunday morning, former hutmen and hutwomen converged on the
3.7-mile Valley Way trail which leads straight up to Madison.
   ``I think it's been lengthened,'' said Robert Ohler, 72, of the
steep hike, which he knew well from working at Madison in the
summers from 1936 to 1939.
   Ohler recalled stealing chairs from other huts, cleaning mouse
droppings from between the plates, heating the hut with bacon grease
and eating porcupine livers.
   ``The nose of a porcupine got 20 cents from the town clerk.
That's where we got our beer money,'' he said.
   Ohler also remembered the death of a teen-ager from hypothermia
during an August storm in which temperatures hit the low 30s. Ohler
had the job of tying the boy to a pack-board and carrying him down
the mountain on his back.
   More than 100 people have died in the mountains. Search and
rescue missions occupied 1,800 AMC work-hours last year, even though
search communications have improved because of radios, huts manager
Michael Torrey said.
   ``Things have changed, including our bodies. That's what I
noticed creaking up the Valley Way,'' said Lincoln Cleveland,
Madison's 1979 hut master. ``But the most important things are the
same. The hut experience really was the best experience of my life.''

<HEAD>Senate Passes Budget $1.1 Trillion Budget For 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress was fulfilling a deficit reduction
agreement with President Reagan when it passed a $1.1 trillion
federal budget for fiscal 1989, but a hefty deficit remains and
spending priorities have already shifted.
   The budget, approved by the House last month and the Senate on
Monday by 58-29, shows a deficit of nearly $142 billion when not
counting sales of government assets, which aren't counted under the
Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   The president's Office of Management and Budget says higher
interest rates combined with government bail-outs of banks could
drive the deficit higher.
   If it gets past $146 billion, OMB is required to order automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.
   And the spending plan doesn't come close to meeting
Gramm-Rudman's goals for the years after fiscal 1989, which are
designed to force a balanced budget by fiscal 1993.
   ``This is a paltry, pathetic and completely meaningless reduction
(of the deficit) during times of economic prosperity,'' complained
Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo. ``We're just putting the whole
problem off until after the election.''
   Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., conceded:
``We've taken some steps in the right direction, but I'm afraid
there's miles to go before we sleep.''
   The spending plan also was nearly two months after the April 15
deadline, creating confusion over the details of next year's federal
spending policy.
   Within total spending levels for military, foreign aid and
domestic programs that were set by last fall's agreement with
Reagan, the budget envisions increased federal spending on the space
program, education, AIDS research, fighting drugs, and other
election-year priorities.
   But the resolution itself is non-binding, acting only as a guide
for production of the annual spending legislation for running the
government. And because of the delays, the House and Senate have
been moving ahead with the regular spending bills that stray from
the budget's priorities.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee voted to include less money
for education and space programs, shifting those funds to energy and
interior agencies.
   ``We urge the appropriations committee to follow our lead and
support the nation's future through increased funding for science
and space programs,'' said Chiles, who had pushed hard for that new
spending.
   Those and other details of next year's federal spending will be
settled in the next few months before the start of fiscal 1989.
   Some of the policies envisioned in the budget:
   _No new taxes for the next year beyond the $14 billion enacted
last December under the agreement with Reagan.
   _Overall budget increases of about half the inflation rate,
including $294 billion for the military, $16.1 billion for foreign
aid and $169.2 billion for domestic agencies.
   _Rejection of Reagan's call to cancel several domestic programs,
such as development grants to state and local governments.
   _Full inflation increases for entitlement benefits, including
Social Security, estimated at 4.2 percent.
   _A 21 percent increase over current levels for science, space and
technology programs, including the space shuttle program and the
superconducting super collider.
   _About $4 billion for anti-drug programs, plus a provision
allowing more to be spent if Congress and the president agree on a
way to pay for it.
   _A 4 percent pay raise for the military and civilian federal
workers.
   _Money for hiring 900 additional air traffic controllers and for
modernizing the air traffic control system.
   Overall spending would be about $5 billion above Reagan's request
and $44 billion above this year's level. Total revenues would be
about $964 billion.
   The deficit in fiscal 1987 was $150.2 billion. The administration
estimates it will drop slightly, to $146 billion, in fiscal 1988,
which ends Sept. 30.

   Edward Schaumberg Quade, who helped
develop the methodical problem-solving method known as systems
analysis, died after suffering a stroke, the Rand Corp. said. He was
79.
   Quade, who had cancer of the spine, died Saturday at Saddleback
Hospital after suffering the stroke a week earlier, Paul Weeks,
spokesman for the Santa Monica-based think tank, said Monday.
   The Jacksonville, Fla., native, a consultant to Rand at the time
of his death, joined the research group when it was founded in 1948
and retired in 1973.
   He and some colleagues devised and developed systems analysis as
a recognized scientific discipline, Weeks said.
   Quade's 1968 book, ``Systems Analysis and Policy Planning:
Applications in Defense,'' defined systems analysis as ``a
systematic approach to helping a decision-maker choose a course of
action by investigating his full problem, searching out objectives
and alternatives, and comparing them in the light of their
consequences.''
   Quade studied physics and mathematics at the University of
Florida in Gainesville, and earned his doctorate at Brown
University. After World War II service in the Navy, he returned to
the University of Florida, where he headed the math department until
joining Rand.
   Survivors include his wife, Sylvia, of Laguna Hills, and three
children.
   A memorial service is scheduled for June 26 in Pacific Palisades.

   A Church of England clergyman who monitors
religious persecution in communist countries says Soviet authorities
have relented and decided to allow him to lead a party of pilgrims
to Moscow.
   The Rev. Michael Bourdeaux said the Soviet Consulate told him
Monday night that he and his wife, Lorna, had been granted visas for
their scheduled flight to Moscow today. He said the decision came
less than a week after they were refused visas.
   Bourdeaux will lead a group of pilgrims to the 1,000th
anniversary celebrations of the introduction of Christianity in
Russia.
   The clergyman said publicity over the fifth time he was refused a
visa for the Soviet Union helped convince the Soviets to change
their minds.
   ``It is very exciting,'' he said. ``I intend to make contact with
churchmen of all varieties and with human rights people.''
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual head of the
Anglican state church, flew to Moscow on Saturday with a party of
British churchmen to attend the ceremonies.
   Bourdeaux, 54, who studied at Moscow State University in 1959-60,
founded the Keston College Center for the Study of Religion and
Communism near London in 1969. The center publishes frequent
information about the state of religion in communist countries.

   Vice President George Bush said Monday he
expects to find himself differing increasingly with administration
policy as the presidential campaign progresses.
   Bush said he would try to keep the situation to ``where I don't
go out and do something to tear down or be negative about this
president. It may not always be that easy.''
   ``We'll probably be dragged into more and more of these things
rather than less,'' he said at a news conference at which he was
questioned about his most recent departure from administration
policy, his advocacy of a delay in an offshore drilling lease off
the northern California coast.
   ``As I become the standard bearer of this party, I'm going to be
saying, without regard to current administration position, here's
what George Bush feels, here's what I feel, here's what my
aspirations for the country are,'' Bush said.
   He said he understood that ``somebody is going to be raising the
question, are you breaking with the president.''
   On the matter of the northern California offshore drilling,
however, the administration came around to Bush's point of view.
Interior Secretary Donald Hodel on Monday night suspended plans for
the controversial project.
   Hodel's primary-eve action came after Bush ran into criticism
from Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis over the oil-lease
question.
   Asked about that criticism, the vice president said, ``I have a
good deal more information than Mr. Dukakis. I made my living at
it.''
   He said, ``I do not favor shutting down all off-shore drilling in
this country.''
   Dukakis, also campaigning in California, said of Bush's call for
delay on the project off northern California, ``I'm pleased he's
coming around, but it's kind of late. I'm not for delaying that sale
_ I'm for canceling it.
   ``It's easy to say, `We'll delay it until after the election.'
What does that mean?''
   The proposed lease sale of the northern California tracts had
been tentatively scheduled for February 1989, pending a decision by
the next administration. But Hodel's action, announced in a
statement issued Monday night in Washington, puts the project on
hold indefinitely.
   Bush, meanwhile, brushed aside polls that show him trailing
Dukakis in California as well as nationwide.
   ``I like this concept of being behind in the polls,'' he said.
   Bush said that in one survey ``two-thirds of the respondents say
that Dukakis is more conservative than Bush.'' He said, ``There's
something weird about that.''
   He opened the news conference by reading a statement in which he
endorsed legislation that would pay reparations to
Japanese-Americans interned during World War II.
   The administration has not taken a position on the bill.
   ``It is only fair that our country provide apologies and
reparations to those innocent Japanese-Americans who suffered as a
result of their internment,'' he said.
   Bush spoke to reporters at Chaffee High School where he met with
students and faculty to talk about drug and alcohol abuse programs.
   He told the students he favored jail sentences for people
convicted of second offenses of drug use.
   ``Drug possession should lead to arrest and a sentence,'' he
said. ``The sentence doesn't have to be jail time, automatically.
There are other alternatives _ a hefty fine, suspending a license,
putting a picture in the paper. ... But failing to stay drug-free
after arrest should mean time in jail. The message should be
unambiguous: If you won't stop, then we'll stop you.''

   One of the two winners who split a
record $51.4 million lottery jackpot says he was relieved he has to
share the windfall so he doesn't have to face ``all this by myself.''
   ``Honest to God, I was hoping that somebody else hit it, too,''
said Sacramento supermarket clerk Randy Pennington, 26, who will
divide North America's largest lottery jackpot with aircraft
mechanic Shelby Carroll, 53, of Vacaville.
   Carroll, a mechanic at Travis Air Force Base, said he purchased
$100 worth of tickets himself because he couldn't find someone to
share his bet.
   The winners, who found themselves instant celebrities Monday,
each will receive $25.7 million annuities that pay $1,028,000
annually, after taxes, for 20 years, lottery officials said.
   At a news conference attended by 100 people, including cheering
lottery agency workers, the Lotto 6-49 winners said they both used a
feature of the lottery ticket terminals that randomly selects
numbers for the player and that they were regular lotto players.
   The winners in Saturday's drawing said they plan to quit their
jobs and have few immediate plans for the money except to help
relatives in various ways.
   Both also said they would be ready for an onslaught of strangers
interested in their bonanza, but declined to discuss details of
their plans.
   Pennington said that after buying his tickets, ``I found a
heads-up penny.''
   ``Every time I've ever found a heads-up penny, something's always
happened good to me. I'm superstitious, I guess,'' he said.
Pennington said he has been buying $5 to $10 in lottery tickets a
week.
   Pennington was uncertain what he'll use the money for, beyond
helping his family, but said he would have more time to indulge his
hobby of collecting antique toys. He added that he has never won
anything before.
   Being single, he was asked if he had any trouble getting dates.
Replied Pennington, ``No. But who wants dates now. I don't.''
   Carroll said he couldn't find someone to match $50 with his $50
to split the bet so he purchased $100 worth of tickets.
   ``I asked my boss ... if he would like to share with me. I said,
`Give me $50 and we'll split the winnings.' At the time, it (the
jackpot) was around $40 million. I said, `Really, no one needs more
than $40 million.' He said, `No.' I asked a couple more of the guys,
and they said, `No.'''
   So Carroll bet $100 himself because, ``I had a feeling.''
   How does he feel now about not finding a partner? ``I'm glad. I
feel sorry for them. But I'm glad.''
   Carroll's wife, Ila, a clerk in the Solano County courts, said
she plans to continue working for a time even though her husband is
retiring.
   Her husband summed up the feelings both winners expressed about
their good fortune: ``It's all happened so fast.''
   The jackpot eclipsed a $46 million prize last October in
Pennsylvania. The biggest previous California jackpot that anybody
won, $25.4 million, was split by two players in October.
   The odds of picking all six numbers out of 49 were about one in
14 million. The winning numbers were 48, 42, 9, 14, 19, 31. The
tickets cost $1.

   Opposition Laborites feuded after party leader Neil
Kinnock said the country's nuclear weapons should be used as
bargaining chips in arms talks _ not just unilaterally scrapped.
   Kinnock's comments were taken as a strong indication he would
discard the party's commitment to elimination of Britain's nuclear
weapons.
   Party leftists have long been suspicious that Kinnock intended to
ditch the anti-nuclear policy before his next election battle
against Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   After he made his remarks Sunday in a television interview, party
leftists on Monday charged him with ignoring the socialist
movement's official policy.
   Kinnock said Sunday that in the wake of the superpower treaty to
eliminate those nations' intermediate-range nuclear missiles, a
Labor government would be wise to use the British arsenal as a
bargaining chip instead of simply scrapping the weapons and shutting
down U.S. nuclear bases.
   ``We would be complete fools, whatever our politics, to ignore
the scope and scale of the change and the opportunities and
responsibilities that go with trying to be part of that change,''
said Kinnock. ``There is no need now for a something-for-nothing
unilateralism.''
   Polaris missiles now based in Britain are due to be replaced in
the early 1990s by the new and far more potent U.S. Trident missile
system, capable of hitting most Soviet cities.
   Kinnock, 46, who has been a lifetime anti-nuclear campaigner,
refused left-wing demands to reaffirm the unilateral disarmament
pledge, saying, ``No, I am not going to issue incantations.''
   Tony Benn, a veteran of the Labor left, complained that Kinnock
was following previous Labor prime ministers _ including Harold
Wilson and James Callaghan _ who that ensured Britain remained a
nuclear power.
   ``The real problem for the Labor Party is not that we have never
persuaded the electorate to support our policies, but that we have
never persuaded our leaders,'' said Benn.
   Benn is to run against Kinnock for the leadership of the party at
the annual conference in the fall but is given little chance of
winning.
   In 1982, three years after losing power to Mrs. Thatcher, Labor's
policy-making annual conference voted for unilateral nuclear
disarmament by a two-thirds majority _ meaning it must be part of
the election platform.
   The pledge was widely seen as being one reason for Labor's two
subsequent defeats by Mrs. Thatcher in 1983 and 1987.
   Kinnock's new position is viewed as a shift to the right in an
attempt to regain power. The next election is to be held before 1992.
   For the left-wingers in his party, the Kinnock switch evokes both
anger and a sense of betrayal toward a politician who was once a
left-winger himself and had been an active member of Britain's
anti-nuclear campaign since he was a student.

   Rock 'n' roll star Chuck Berry is being sought by
police after failing to surrender for booking on a 6-month-old
misdemeanor assault charge alleging that he slapped a woman.
   Police Officer Max Polster said he believes Berry, 62, failed to
show as expected Sunday because of a misunderstanding between
prosecutors and Berry's lawyer.
   A warrant had already been issued for Berry's arrest in January
after he failed to appear in Manhattan Criminal Court to answer the
assault charge. If convicted, he could face up to a year in jail.
   The writer and singer of such rock classics as ``Roll Over
Beethoven'' and ``Johnny B. Goode'' is accused of hitting a woman in
a hotel on Dec. 18. The woman's identity was not released.
   Berry's talent agency said he did two shows Saturday night at the
Ritz, a Manhattan nightclub, and flew to Portland, Ore., where he
appeared in concert Monday night.
   At Monday night's concert, Berry was booed after he threatened to
walk off the stage if news photographers did not leave the show. The
photographers left and the show resumed. Berry was not arrested.
   Portland Police Bureau spokesman Henry Groepper said earlier that
officers there would not get involved in the case.

   A joint national proposal by the governors of
Ohio and New York to reduce acid rain shows Ohio ``is finally
reading the writing on the wall'' and seeking help to curb pollution
from its coal-fired power plants, a congressman says.
   On Monday, Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste and New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo made public their proposal to reduce polluting sulfur dioxide
emissions from utility sources by 10 million tons by the year 2003.
   The plan calls for authorizing $900 million a year from the
federal government to finance up to 50 percent of the capital costs.
Most of that money would come from having the oil industry take over
the cost of filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The polluters themselves would have to raise about $900 million a
year under the deal.
   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., said it represents ``significant
progress'' anytime Ohio and New York can agree on acid rain.
   Sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal have been
blamed as a major cause of acid rain, which environmentalists say is
destroying waters and woodlands in the Northeast.
   Much of the sulfur dioxide comes from coal-burning power plants
along the Ohio River.
   Sikorski, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is
the main sponsor of an acid rain control bill pending in committee.
His bill would mandate a 10-million-ton reduction in emissions by
1998.
   ``This agreement shows that there is renewed seriousness about
dealing with the issue,'' Sikorski said. ``It indicates that Ohio is
finally reading the writing on the wall. This could be their last
good chance at legislation that assists them with their cleanup
costs.''
   But the proposal drew fire from other lawmakers.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said that while he
is encouraged by the dialogue between Ohio and New York on acid
rain, he sees nothing new in the proposal.
   ``The key element of any effort to deal with acid rain has to be
time,'' said Byrd. ``And this proposal does not allow enough time
for the development of clean-coal technologies. Coal is essential to
America's national security, and we cannot afford to adopt an acid
rain policy that would devastate the coal industry.''
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said the proposal would hurt Ohio and
accused Celeste of not speaking for Ohioans on the issue.
   Regardless of the financing ``gimmicks,'' said Luken, Ohio
consumers ``will pay millions of dollars and Ohio will lose
thousands of jobs for no known benefit.''
   Ohio, next to coal-rich West Virginia, has a significant
coal-mining industry.
   Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt., said he believes the proposal
represents a breakthrough because it is the first time a major
emitter of sulfur dioxide, Ohio, has attempted to come to grips with
the acid rain problem.
   Stafford, who is ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee, has been a major proponent of acid rain
control and is a co-sponsor of legislation authored by Sen. George
Mitchell, D-Maine, that would reduce emissions by 12 million tons.
   ``I think it's a very encouraging development,'' said Stafford,
adding that he expects that the Senate committee will want to review
the Ohio-New York proposal and possibly amend the pending
legislation to take advantage of the initiative.
   The proposal, an amendment to the Clean Air Act, calls for
reductions in sulfur dioxide emmissions in three phases: 3.5 million
tons by 1993, another 4.5 million tons by 1998 and another 2 million
tons by 2003.
   The agreement would also establish a 10-year, $2.5 billion
expanded clean coal technology program to achieve reductions in
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.
   Daniel Weiss, Washington representative of the Sierra Club,
called the new proposal encouraging because it comes in part from
Ohio, the largest single emitter of sulfur dioxide in the nation.
   ``This is a statesmanlike proposal, but it doesn't include enough
reductions soon enough to adequately protect public health or the
environment,'' said Weiss.
   However, he said the environmental group believes that the
proposal will help move acid rain control legislation in Congress.
   Susan K. Roth, spokeswoman for the Edison Electric Institute,
said the deadlines in the Celeste-Cuomo proposal are not flexible
enough to allow for the use of new clean-coal technologies. And she
said the additional costs to the oil industry would be passed along
to consumers.
   ``We don't see that this is going to give us any better long-term
reductions than the program that is already in place,'' said Ms.
Roth.

   A U.S. Park Police officer escorting the
Kennedy family Monday to a memorial service for Robert F. Kennedy
was struck and critically injured by a speeding driver, officials
said.
   Sgt. Paul Johnson, 37, was taken by helicopter to Fairfax
Hospital following the 6:30 p.m. accident, in which he suffered a
fractured skull, said U.S. Park Police spokeswoman Sandra Alley.
   Johnson had stopped traffic on the roadway for the Kennedy
motorcade near the CIA headquarters in angley, a suburb of
Washington, D.C., said Fairfax County police Officer Pete Kirby.
   William E. Ferro, of Bethesda, Md., was standing next to Johnson
when a speeding motorist skidded into them, said Debbie Godwin,
spokeswoman for Fairfax County police.
   None of the Kennedy family members was injured, Kirby said.
   Paul D. Addington, 18, of McLean, Va., was speeding when he came
over the crest of a hill, hit his brakes and skidded into the two
police motorcycles, said Godwin. The collision threw Johnson's
motorcycle against him, Godwin said.
   Ferro received minor scratches and bruises, Godwin said.
   Police originally reported that Addington had tried to flee the
scene, but Godwin later said the teenager remained and was arrested
at the scene.
   The police spokeswoman said Addington was charged with reckless
driving.
   Johnson is a 12-year veteran of the force who lives in Arlington,
Va. He remained in the intensive care unit Tuesday.
   About 5,000 people attended the memorial service at Kennedy's
grave in Arlington National Cemetery. The ceremony marked the 20th
anniversary of his assassination.
   Robert Kennedy Jr. informed the audience at the memorial service
about the accident and asked for a moment of silence to pray for the
officer and his family.

<TEXT>
   George Bush, saying he ``can't wait for this
primary season to end,'' is going on the offensive in an effort to
portray Democrat Michael Dukakis as a ``Massachusetts liberal in the
stripe of George McGovern.''
   The primary season ends today with voting in California, New
Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.
   At a GOP function in San Bernardino Monday, Bush applied the
``Massachusetts liberal'' label to Dukakis. And at a news conference
earlier in the day, he said, ``I don't sense a swing to the left in
this country to this Brookline, Massachusetts, liberalism.''
   Brookline is the Boston suburb where Dukakis grew up and lives
today.
   In his remarks to the GOP audience, Bush ticked off a number of
issues on which he said he and Dukakis differ.
   ``I favor the death penalty for drug kingpins and he opposes
it,'' said the vice president.
   ``I'll never understand,'' he went on ``why Michael Dukakis
vetoed a bill providing for the Pledge of Allegiance to be said in
the schools of Massachusetts. I favor the Pledge of Allegiance being
said anywhere and everywhere.''
   Dukakis has said he vetoed the legislation after being advised by
the state supreme court that it was unconstitutional.
   Bush's free-wheeling attack on the Dukakis was the sort of
offensive many Republicans have been advising as a way to overcome
the advantage Dukakis currently holds in opinion polls of voters.
   At his news conference, Bush dismissed surveys suggesting he
trails Dukakis in California and nationwide.
   He said that in one survey two-thirds of the respondents said
Dukakis was more conservative than Bush.
   ``There's something weird about that,'' he said.
   Bush was certain to sweep the 175 delegates at stake in
California's winner-take-all Republican primary. All of his GOP
opponents have dropped out of the race and endorsed him for the
party's nomination to succeed Ronald Reagan.
   Dukakis was expected to pick up enough delegates in the day's
four primaries to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Bush supporters contend that the public has a distorted image of
the Massachusetts governor because he has been involved in a race
against Jesse Jackson, a contest in which Dukakis came across as a
moderate.
   A major goal for the Republicans is to portray Dukakis as a
liberal who would return the country to big spending domestic
programs.
   The Massachusetts governor twitted Bush over the vice president's
decision to call Sunday for a delay in offshore oil drilling off the
Northern California coast. Dukakis called the decision an effort to
curry favor among California voters who tend to feel strongly about
environmental issues.
   The issue subsided when Interior Secretary Donald Hodel suspended
plans to lease 1.1 million acres off the Northern California coast
for oil drilling.
   ``He can make a political challenge,'' Bush responded to Dukakis'
criticism, ``and I will be challenging him as to what he thinks is a
great energy program for the United States of America.''
   Bush said, ``I have a good deal more information than Mr.
Dukakis. I made my living at it (oil drilling).''
   Bush, drawing a contrast between his position and that of
Dukakis, said, ``I do not favor shutting down all offshore drilling
in this country.''
   He said their differences would be aired and ``I am, I think, on
the right side.''
   Dukakis, who speaks fluent Spanish has shown strength in some
surveys among California's large Hispanic population, but Bush said
he was confident of doing well among the same voters.
   ``On the Hispanics, I have some understanding there,'' he said
``because three of my grandchildren are half Mexican.'' His son
Jeb's wife is Mexican.
   ``I think I understand the heartbeat of the Hispanic community,''
he went on.
   Bush's position on the offshore drilling was another step away
from Reagan administration policy which favors more drilling, and
the vice president said more such differences would emerge.
   ``As I become the standard-bearer of this party, I'm going to be
saying, without regard to current administration position, here's
what George Bush feels,'' he said.
   ``We'll probably be dragged into more of these things rather than
less, but I will try to keep it that I don't go out and do something
to tear down or be negative about this president. It may not always
be that easy.''

<HEAD>Tongue-In-Cheek Tabloid Designed To Draw Opera Fans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new tabloid aimed at encouraging Hoosiers
to spend a night at the opera instead of a night at the basketball
game features screaming headlines and bizarre tales _ of Hoffman.
   According to the debut edition of the Indianapolis Opera
Inquirer, an avid opera fan supposedly gave birth to a boy during
the last act of a performance of ``Tales of Hoffman.'' Three ushers
and a cast member received a standing ovation for helping with the
delivery.
   Another story tells the tongue-in-cheek tale of a teen-ager who
took off his personal stereo for the first time in three years to
hear the opera ``Carmen.''
   ``He washed the green and pink dye out of his hair, put on clean
clothes and helped me set the table,'' his thrilled mother was
quoted as saying.
   The Inquirer will be mailed to subscribers and about 20,000
non-subscribers. A ticket order form is included.
   ``I love it because you're definitely going to read it and it has
the confidence to have humor. It says that opera is for everyone,''
Indianapolis Opera Artistic Director Robert B. Driver said.
   ``Opera has always been viewed as the fat lady with the big
voice, as stodgy and only for the elite. But that's not at all
true,'' said Vaughn B. Hickman, president of Hickman and Associates
advertising agency and the brains behind the Inquirer campaign.
   Two years ago, Indianapolis Opera had 900 subscribers. Last year,
after another Hickman promotion, there were 1,300.
   Hickman and opera officials said the numbers indicate how
difficult it is to sell opera in sports-loving Indiana. They believe
the tabloid will help change attitudes.
   ``Just like sports, opera is recreation, enjoyment and fun,''
said Donna Noblitt, marketing and public relations director of
Indianapolis Opera. ``The unknown is always a little scary, but we
want to excite people and get them to try it.''

<HEAD>Japanese Red Army Members in Korea Will Try to Return, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven suspected members of Japan's Red Army
terrorist group who hijacked a Japanese airliner to North Korea 18
years ago want to come home for trial, a Japanese journalist said
today.
   Takamaro Tamiya, the group's leader, delivered that message in a
lengthy telephone call to the Tokyo-based monthly literary magazine
Bungei Shunju, said an employee of the magazine who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Tamiya urged the Japanese government to meet with his group for
talks and told the magazine they would ask to be tried in a Japanese
court.
   Last month, Japanese police arrested one of the nine suspected
Red Army members who hijacked the Japan Airlines domestic flight to
the North Korean capital of Pyongyang in 1970.
   Police believe Yasuhiro Shibata, 34, returned to Japan in April
1985 from North Korea with a false passport. He is the only suspect
arrested in the hijacking.
   Investigators in Tokyo were questioning Shibata about the
hijacking and whether he and other members of the group were
plotting renewed terrorist action, police said.
   One of the original nine men died of illness recently in
Pyongyang.
   The Red Army, formed in the late 1960s, advocates ``simultaneous
world revolution.'' It is said to have had no more than 300 members
at its peak and in recent years has operated mainly with Arab
leftists in the Middle East.

<HEAD>Congressman Suffering Pneumonia, Rejection of New Lungs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Floyd Spence has taken a turn for
the worse and is suffering pneumonia and an attempt by his body to
reject the lungs he received in a May 7 transplant, doctors say.
   ``It's a definite setback. No question about it. His condition is
pretty serious,'' Dr. Seshadri Raju, who led the University of
Mississippi Medical Center transplant team, said Monday.
   The 60-year-old South Carolina Republican, who suffered from
emphysema, overcame earlier episodes of infection and rejection and
had been doing well enough in a private room to walk with assistance
and ride a stationary cycle.
   He was moved out of his private room and into coronary care
Sunday night because he was having difficulty breathing, perhaps
because of the pneumonia, Raju said.
   ``It will take 24 to 36 hours to sort things out. We think he may
be having a rejection on top of an infection,'' he added, saying he
suspects a rejection episode because of the deterioration in
Spence's condition.
   Spence is being treated with Gentamicin and Vancomycin, two of
the most powerful antibiotics available, and is being fed
intravenously while receiving supplemental oxygen, Raju said.
   His blood pressure, heart and kidneys continue to be normal, Raju
said.
   Spence, whose condition has been downgraded from stable to
serious, was alert and talking until he was heavily sedated, Raju
added.
   The six-term incumbent has announced plans to seek re-election.
He is being challenged by Democrat Jim Leventis.

   The Reagan administration wants to sell the
U.S. Navy's most sophisticated shipboard air defense system to Japan
as part of a $468 million sales package.
   The Pentagon, in a series of announcements, also notified
Congress on Monday of additional plans to sell arms to South Korea,
Greece and Turkey. Those deals will total about $200 million.
   The proposed sale of the Aegis Combat System to Japan generated
opposition in the House earlier this year, but that opposition has
evaporated and the deal is now expected to win congressional
blessing.
   ``Installation of Aegis on a ship of the Japanese Maritime
Self-Defense Force will enhance Japanese capability to protect its

   ``It is in U.S. national interests to assist Japan in meeting

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission has
ordered the recall of about 9,000 Toycraft stuffed bears because the
eyes and ears of the toys could come off and pose a choking hazard
for children.
   One child died of asphyxiation after the plastic nose from one of
the 26-inch bears became lodged in her larynx, the commission
reported Monday.
   The recall covers stuffed bears with labels identifying the maker
as ``Toycraft Industries Inc., Brooklyn, N.Y.'' and stating
``Stuffed Toys for Tots and Teens.''
   The commission urged parents to take the bears from children and
return them to the store where purchased for a full refund.

   A U.S. Park Police officer was in critical

Kennedy.
   Sgt. Paul Johnson, 37, fractured his skull in the collision
Monday, which happened as he was directing traffic on a suburban
Washington, D.C., roadway the Kennedy motorcade was taking to
Arlington National Cemetery, officials said.
   A man standing next to the officer suffered minor abrasions, but
none of the Kennedy family members was injured, said Fairfax County
Police spokeswoman Debbie Godwin.
   Paul D. Addington, 18, of McLean, Va., was charged with reckless
driving in the accident, said Godwin.
   The police spokeswoman said Addington was speeding when he came
over the crest of a hill, hit his brakes and skidded into two police
motorcycles, said Godwin. The collision threw Johnson's motorcycle
against him, Godwin said.
   Johnson, a 12-year veteran of the U.S. Park Police, was in
intensive care early today at Fairfax Hospital.
   About 5,000 people attended the memorial service Monday at
Kennedy's grave. The ceremony marked the 20th anniversary of his

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell slightly at
the end of trading Tuesday after a record high closing the previous

   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues declined by a

27,967.32.
   On Monday, the stock market's key barometer closed at 27,996.24

   After opening the day at 125.75 yen, the dollar edged up slightly
and ended the day at 125.77 yen, down 0.30 yen from Monday's close.
   ``The dollar is moving in tight range in the absence of

   The U.S. currency was stable against the yen despite weakening
against the West German mark, he said. Bundesbank President Karl

<HEAD>Japan Says It Is Trimming Trade Surplus, Urges U.S. To Do Its Share</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRENE M. KUNII</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan is trimming its huge trade surplus by
expanding imports and stepping up overseas investment, the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry said today.
   But the United States must do its part for the world economy by
easing its budget and trade deficits, the ministry said in a report
summing up Japan's foreign trade in 1987.
   It also said Japan should play a bigger role in Asian development
through direct investment and importing more of the region's
manufactured goods.
   The report, issued annually since 1949, praises ongoing
structural changes that have improved access to the Japanese market
for foreign exporters of manufactured goods.
   ``Manufactured imports are increasing rapidly and the
distribution system in Japan is undergoing a change,'' said Atsushi
Oi, head of the ministry's International Trade Research Office.
   Japan's trade surplus fell in fiscal 1987 for the first time in
six years, from $101.65 billion in 1986 to $94.28 billion, according
to Japanese figures.
   Still, Japan's trade surplus with the United States continued to
climb, hitting $4.9 billion in December 1987 from $4.7 billion a
year earlier, the latest government figures show.
   Oi said increased exports of capital goods to the United States
contributed to the increase. Capital goods exports are rising as
Japanese firms send equipment to set up U.S. production facilities.
   ``Secondly, and this has a bigger share, is that American
companies look to excellent capital goods exports from Japan and
install these in their plants,'' Oi said.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said exports bound for the
United States will fall from the present 40 percent share of Japan's
total to 25-30 percent as Japan restructures its export-driven
economy toward domestic demand.
   He did not give a time frame.
   The trade ministry report says Japanese imports grew by 9.3
percent in 1987 over the previous year, while export volume rose
only 0.3 percent.
   Oi said the United States can lessen its trade deficit by cutting
down on excessive consumer demand, expanding production facilities
and revamping its export policy.
   The report says the U.S. trade deficit hit $171.2 billion in
1987, up $15 billion over 1986.
   U.S. exports to Japan rose by a meager 8.4 percent in 1987, but
those from Asia's newly industrialized countries of South Korea,
Taiwan and Hong Kong soared by 50.3 percent, the report says.
   The white paper is cautious about the future of Japan's
restructuring. It says that while imports are growing along with
domestic demand, nations awash in surplus funds like Japan ``must
expand imports and provide a stable supply of capital to debtor
nations.''
   ``The role of Japan from now on is to help Asian countries create
... a region of development that is open to the rest of the world,''
Oi said.

   Right-wing groups today protested the arrival of two
Soviet fishing vessels by blasting anti-Soviet slogans at them from
110 cars and trucks rigged with loudspeakers.
   More than 1,700 police officers were mobilized to protect 53
sailors aboard the ships in Shiogama, a port city about 190 miles
northeast of Tokyo, said a Miyagi Prefectural Police spokesman who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There were no reports of injuries or scuffles between police and
the 410 rightists representing 60 fringe groups, the spokesman said.
Police blocked roads and fenced off the port area.
   The 738-ton Komissorovo and the 448-ton Belinskoe called on
Shiogama to replenish food and water supplies and were scheduled to
depart Wednesday afternoon. Crew members were allowed off the ships
today for shopping, the spokesman said.
   Soviet fishing ships are allowed to dock at designated ports in
Japan under a bilateral fisheries treaty. The two vessels, the first
to call at Shiogama under the pact this year, represented only the
second port call since 1985.
   Fiercely anti-communist right-wing groups in Japan often deploy
specially equipped vehicles with loudspeakers to protest the Soviet
presence in several northern islands claimed by Japan but occupied
by the Soviet Union since the end of World War II.

<TEXT>
   One year after a former top aide
accused him of rigging elections, drug trafficking and corruption,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega still firmly controls the government and
may well run for president next year.
   The accusations were made by Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera last June
after he was demoted from second-in-command. They emboldened
thousands of Panamanians to take to the streets to demand Noriega's
ouster.
   Diaz Herrera was arrested and sent into exile in Venezuela.
   A similar fate befell Eric Arturo Delvalle, who as president
tried to fire Noriega as Defense Forces chief in February after two
U.S. grand juries indicted the general on drug trafficking charges.
   Noriega ousted Delvalle, who went into hiding in Panama.
   On Monday, opposition leaders called on Latin American
governments to mediate efforts to remove the general from power, a
goal Washington has failed to achieve through economic sanctions and
negotiations.
   But Noriega has indicated he will not permit any mediation that
would ease him out of office and the government already is making
plans to hold elections in May 1989 with or without the opposition.
   Pro-government groups are mentioning Noriega as a likely
candidate of the government's Democratic Revolutionary Party in next
year's presidential elections.
   A source close to Noriega told The Associated Press Monday night
that any discussions with Latin American leaders would amount to
``talks with the United States by proxy.''
   ``And the general is not leaving,'' said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``The United States and the opposition must
understand that.''
   The Reagan administration announced last month that its effort to
remove Noriega through negotiations had failed. The widespread,
mostly nonviolent opposition demonstrations that began one year ago
also failed to loosen the general's grip on power.
   A Foreign Ministry statement released Monday night assailed the
opposition call to ``Latin Americanize the Panamanian crisis'' as an
effort ``to hide ... the deliberate execution of a vast plan of
internal destabilization'' against the government.
   Noriega has strengthened his position by forming the Strategic
Military Council, a group of 20 of his closest collaborators. They
include the commander of the elite Year 2000 Battalion, another
troop commander and key officers in other sections of the
15,000-strong Defense Forces.
   ``They supersede the Chiefs of Staff,'' said an opposition
leader, also speaking privately. ``They are younger than the chiefs
of staff and are the ones making all decisions with Noriega.''
   Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon, head of the Christian Democrat Party,
said the council may have promoted the breakdown in talks with the
United States.
   ``They probably want Noriega to stay on longer and get rid of the
older members'' of the Defense Forces command, he said.
   Chief of Staff Col. Marcos Justines, who negotiated with U.S.
representatives, is not a member of the council.
   On Monday night Noriega and his generals, dressed in civilian
clothes, accompanied president Manuel Solis Palma and other top
military officers to attend a play depicting U.S. interventions in
Panama. The sketch was performed by members of the Defense Forces'
elite anti-terrorist unit.
   Hundreds of people chanted anti-American slogans and applauded
Noriega as he shook hands with civilians and military recruits.

<TEXT>
   Ella Raines, who starred opposite John Wayne
and Charles Laughton and who traveled the world as the wife of a
World War II flying ace, has died of throat cancer. She was 67.
   Private family servies were held for the 1940s-era star whose
screen image was described as sultry and mysterious. She died last
week at her home in suburban Sherman Oaks.
   Ms. Raines, born in Snoqualmie Falls, Wash., achieved almost
overnight stardom in 1943 when she was made the sole contract star
of a $1 million production company founded by actor Charles Boyer
and director Howard Hanks.
   Her first movie was ``Corvette K-255,'' but she was probably best
known for her role in the 1944 thriller ``Phantom Lady.''
   She made 20 films, including ``Tall in the Saddle'' with Wayne
and ``The Suspect'' with Laughton, and also starred in the 1950s
television series ``Janet Dean R.N.''
   Ms. Raines, whose first marriage to a childhood sweetheart ended
in divorce shortly after World War II, married flying ace Maj. Robin
Olds in 1947.
   The union led to international travel as her husband was
transferred to various bases around the world.
   Olds, who eventually became a brigadier general, was commander of
the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs in the late 1960s, where
the couple was well known for their entertaining.
   The couple divorced in 1975, and Ms. Raines returned to Southern
California.
   She made guest appearances on a few TV shows in recent years,
including ``Matt Houston'' and ``Police Story.''
   She is survived by two daughters, Christina Newman and Susan Olds.

   A cigarette lighter's flame may have
sparked the methane gas explosion in a coal mine shaft that led to
the deaths of at least 46 men, a national television network
reported.
   Also Monday, mine owners defended the rescue operation despite
the revelation that a radio operator told six trapped miners to get
off a radio channel just hours after Wednesday's blast.
   The six were discovered alive Saturday after officials had
insisted there were no signs of life in the Stolzenbach mine in
Borken, 72 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   A statement from the rescue team said searchers had found another
miner's body early today, bringing the total confirmed dead to 47.
Four men were still missing in the mine's north field, which
officials said had the highest concentrations of deadly carbon
monoxide.
   Prosecutors are investigating whether an open flame may have
ignited the gas explosion, the ZDF television network reported
Monday night. ZDF, quoting unidentified officials, said cigarette
lighters were found inside the mine.
   It said miners were known to have smoked on the job, but a mining
official said he doubted that was true.
   ``We have very strict regulations against smoking in the mine,
and if someone were to be caught doing it they would be immediately
fired,'' said Wulf Boettcher, an official with the Preussen Elektra
utility company that operates the Borken mine.
   Kassel prosecutor Stephan Walcher said a full investigation was
launched into the cause of the disaster. But he refused to elaborate
or to say whether a cigarette lighter may have caused the explosion.
   High concentrations of carbon monoxide inside the mine delayed
search efforts on Monday. Exhausted rescuers were forced to renew
their oxygen supplies repeatedly.
   Authorities said that because of the deadly carbon monoxide
fumes, there was little chance the missing miners would be found
alive.
   Owners of the coal mine acknowledged Sunday that a radio operator
told the six surviving miners to stop sending messages from the
pocket of air where they were trapped because he thought they were
another search team.
   Heinz Cramer, a technical director for Preussen Elekta, told
reporters Monday that failure to recognize the radio contact as a
sign of life from the trapped miners had not endangered the men.
   ``We knew that the area (where the men were found) presented the
best possibility of finding survivors, and that's where we began
drilling,'' Cramer said.
   The six were finally discovered after their sounds were picked up
by a television crew's microphone lowered into a shaft 500 feet
beneath the earth.

<HEAD>Morton Thiokol Declines To Bid On Advanced Solid Rocket Motor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morton Thiokol, sole manufacturer of solid-fuel
space shuttle boosters blamed for the Challenger disaster, has
dropped out of the competition for a $1.2 billion contract to make
boosters for the 1990s.
   The Chicago-based company announced Monday that it wants to
concentrate on redesigning the booster used on Challenger, whose
fiery disintegration shortly after takeoff killed all seven
astronauts aboard.
   A presidential commission blamed the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion on
a plume of hot gas that leaked through a joint in a Thiokol-built
solid-fuel booster, igniting the main fuel tank.
   The motor redesign is almost complete, with a test firing set for
next month at Cape Canaveral, Fla., said Rocky Raab, a company
spokesman in Utah.
   Thiokol's Utah plant was the sole manufacturer of shuttle
boosters, and the National Aeronautics and Space Admininistration
must look elsewhere for producers of the next-generation version,
the advanced solid rocket motor.
   ``One of the principal reasons that Morton Thiokol is not bidding
is because we are acutely aware of our responsibilities in the
redesigned solid rocket motor program,'' U. Edwin Garrison, the
company's group vice president for aerospace, said in an
announcement released in Chicago.
   NASA plans to use Thiokol's redesigned motor when it resumes
shuttle flights.
   The advanced motor will be used in the mid-1990s, and NASA
anticipates healthy competition for the advanced booster contract
despite Thiokol's decision, agency spokeswoman Sarah Keegan said
from Washington.
   Less than two months ago, Thiokol officials insisted the company
would compete for the $1.2 billion contract.
   Although bidding has not opened, Raab said three other parties
have expressed interest: United Technologies, a team of Lockheed and
Aerojet, and another team consisting of Hercules, Atlantic Research
Corp. and Martin Marietta.
   Thiokol's announcement followed an earlier NASA announcement that
it wanted to build a government-owned plant to produce the larger
rocket motors and have a private manufacturer operate the plant
under contract.
   NASA has earmarked $27 million of its current budget for design
and initial construction of a new booster plant somewhere on the
Gulf Coast. Officials have said they plan to add $65 million from
next year's budget for the project. They estimate it will take at
least 10 years to make the plant operational.
   The proposal to shift shuttle booster construction from Thiokol's
plant to a government-owned factory near water was criticized
earlier this year as unfair to Thiokol by state and company
officials and members of Utah's congressional delegation. The
critics included Gov. Norm Bangerter and Republican Sen. Jake Garn.
   A hearing requested by Garn on NASA's plans is scheduled before a
Senate appropriations subcommittee Wednesday.
   Thiokol, which makes and sells chemicals, rockets and salt, plans
to invest $200 million in coming years to modernize its northern
Utah plant in order to seek other space and defense business, Raab
said.
   The plant 90 miles north of Salt Lake City is one of the state's
largest private employers, with 2,500 workers.
   Thiokol intends to go after the Air Force advanced launch system,
a strap-on booster and other contracts, Raab said.
   The company's announcement got a negative reaction on Wall
Street, where Thiokol shares fell $1.125 to close at $39.875 in
trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Robert Bartels, an analyst with William Blair investment firm in
Chicago, said that if Thiokol pursued the advanced shuttle rocket
contract ``they are, in effect raising questions about their own
current designs. The company feels they have a good design.''
   Bartels said the company may believe that the advanced rocket
program may not be approved by Congress and that the redesign
program for the Challenger rocket will be.
   ``There's been a lot of speculation that the company will sell
the aerospace business and is not willing to commit to it in the
long term,'' he said.
   Raab said Thiokol intends to keep the aerospace unit, which
contributes 40 percent of company sales.

<HEAD>Goode, Coleman Angry at Pennsylvania Delegate Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the city's top Democrats are
complaining about rules that gave all of Pennsylvania's 62 pledged
party and at-large delegates to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode and City Council President Joseph Coleman
reaffirmed their support for Jesse Jackson in a statement issued
late Monday.
   ``It's unfortunate that the political leadership of one of the
largest cities in the nation find themselves in the position of
having to attend the Democratic National Convention as Dukakis
delegates in spite of their continued support of Rev. Jackson's
candidacy,'' the statement said.
   The state committee awarded the delegates to Dukakis during a
weekend meeting.
   Jackson got only 7 percent of the delegates even though he won 28
percent of the popular vote in the April 26 primary.
   Democratic state chairman Larry Yatch agreed the rules need to be
changed at the Atlanta convention.

   The switch means 41 delegates, most previously committed to Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, will jump to the Dukakis camp. As it
now stands, all but six of Kentucky's 67 delegates to the July

   The remaining delegates are committed to Jesse Jackson.

<HEAD>Bomb Kills Soldier, Wounds Four as Indians Begin Pullout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Separatist Tamil rebels blew up an
Indian army jeep today, killing one soldier and wounding four just
hours before hundreds of Indian troops began boarding nearby ships
to return home.
   One Sri Lankan officer called the attack ``a show of strength''
by the rebels, who have fought a five-year war for greater autonomy.
Indian officials said their at least partial troop withdrawal would
go on as scheduled.
   Sri Lankan military officers said the jeep was patrolling about
six miles south of the port city of Trincomalee when the rebels
detonated a mine under it. Just a few hours later, Indian sodliers
began pulling out as scheduled in Trincomalee, 140 miles northeast
of Colombo.
   ``It was a show of strength by the rebels,'' said the Sri Lankan
officer, who cannot be identified under briefing rules. ``It's a
slap in the face.''
   The Indian High Commission, or embassy, confirmed the attack but
gave no details. But Deputy High Commissioner Nirupam Sen said the
attack did not affect the pullout of the first contingent of Indian
peacekeeping soldiers and weapons, including Soviet-made T-72 tanks
and 105mm and 120mm artillery.
   At least 3,000 of the estimated 50,000 Indian soldiers in Sri
Lanka were scheduled to depart for home today by ship from
Trincomalee.
   Indian Defense Minister K.C. Pant said last week that ``excess
troops and armor'' would be sent home but announced no firm
timetable for a complete withdrawal.
   India began sending in soldiers last July to enforce a peace
accord aimed at ending the civil war on this island off its southern
coast. The deployment increased in October after rebels renounced
the peace plan, refused to surrender their weapons and resumed
fighting.
   The Indian troops, stationed only in the north and east where
Tamils are in the majority, had been ordered to disarm the rebel
fighters.
   Predominantly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people and claim they are discriminated against by the
mostly Buddhist Sinhalese, who constitute 75 percent of the
population and control the government and military.
   The peace accord reached by the India and the Sri Lankan
government of President Junius Jayewardene calls for election of
district councils to give the nation's nine provinces greater
autonomy.
   Elections have been held in six provinces so far, and voting is
scheduled for Thursday in the predominantly Sinhalese Southern
Province.
   Balloting has been postponed in the Tamil-dominated Northern and
Eastern provinces because of the fighting.
   India, a major regional power, negotiated the peace accord and
agreed to police it partly for fear of sympathies that its own 60
million Tamils feel for the rebel cause.
   Though the Indians have been unable to stem the fighting, a
string of recent victories led them to agree with Sri Lanka on at
least a partial pullout.
   The Indian presence has been criticized by many Sinhalese, who
view it as a threat to Sri Lankan independence.

<HEAD>Feds Halt Offshore Oil Lease Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of the Reagan administration's
proposal for extensive oil leasing off the Northern California coast
claimed credit for the decision to suspend the plan, but said they
remain wary it won't be scuttled.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel late Monday made the announcement
to halt work on the proposal to lease 1.1 million offshore acres.
The decision effectively pushes the sale back at least until to
August 1989.
   Hodel's action came on the eve of the California primary and a
day after Vice President George Bush softened his pro-drilling
stance and called for the offshore plan to be delayed.
   ``I take that as good news,'' Bush, a one-time Texas oilman who
previously had expressed unconditional support for drilling, said
when informed of Hodel's decision while campaigning in Southern
California.
   Democratic presidential hopefuls Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson have advocated stopping all offshore drilling.
   ``This is an attempt to try to get Bush off the hook,'' said
Richard Charter, a Washington lobbyist who represents California
coastal communties in their fight against the drilling.
   He said the announcement also could be an effort to prevent
Congress from imposing a one-year moratorium on the sale. The House
Appropriations Committee is scheduled on Wednesday to consider such
a plan to delay leasing until 1990.
   Anmother critic, Humboldt County Supervisor Wesley Chesbro, said,
``We've succeeded beyond our wildest dreams in making this an issue
of importance to the national campaign.''
   However, he added, ``Temporary political delays are great, but
they're not what we're looking for.''
   Hodel said in a statement that ``it appears that no valid public
purpose would be served by preparation and publication of a final
environmental impact statement containing a proposed course of
action for Lease Sale 91.''
   The department estimates that the area proposed for the lease
could contain up to 790 million barrels of oil _ a two-month supply
for the United States _ and between 820 billion and 1.5 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas. It says there is a 50-50 chance of
finding the petroleum.
   The proposed lease sale of tracts off Mendocino and Humboldt
counties had been tentatively scheduled for February 1989, pending a
decision by the next administration.
   At least six months is needed between the report's conclusion and
a sale, due to hearings and other preparatory work. Department
spokesman David Prosperi said the environmental report could have
been prepared as early as August.
   Hodel indicated he was reluctant to take the action.
   ``I believe we do not have to choose between development of
offshore oil or protection of the California coast,'' he said.
``Experience shows we can have both.''
   Dukakis had criticized Bush earlier Monday for ``coming around''
to his latest position ``kind of late.''
   And, the Democratic front-runner said: ``It's easy to say, `We'll
delay it until after the election.' What does that mean?''
   Bush's aides acknowledged that his statement on Sunday
represented a major concession to strong bipartisan environmental
sentiments in the state.
   ``George Bush recognizes the importance of environmental and
quality-of-life issues in California,'' said chief of staff Craig
Fuller.
   Charter said that if Bush becomes president, Hodel's action
represents ``only a six-month reprieve for Lease Sale 91.'' The
lobbyist said the vice president has not made a clear commitment to
do away with the sale, noting that ``There are a lot of qualifiers
in his statement.''
   The Western Oil and Gas Association said it supported Hodel's
decision for ``a reasonable delay.''
   ``We're political realists,'' said Craig Hume, a spokesman for
the industry group. ``Right now, it is clear that the people of
California _ especially the people of Northern California _ are not
comfortable with the environmental studies that now exist.''

<HEAD>World of Play Can Be Harsh for Migrant Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WIMAUMA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While most kids spend their time playing
with toy trucks and tractors, migrant children often play in the
hot, dusty strawberry fields of Florida with the real thing.
   The harsh world of heavy equipment and soil-cutting tools can
mean deep gashing wounds, burns, severed limbs and sometimes, loss
of life.
   It was in one of those strawberry patches on an April day last
year that 7-year-old Karla Polanco nearly lost her leg as she
dangled it over the rear of a truck while her parents picked
strawberries nearby.
   Somebody wanted the truck moved, so her 12-year-old playmate
hopped in the front seat, shifted into reverse and slammed Karla's
leg between the rig and a trailer.
   And last week, 5-year-old Fidencio Jaurequi's right arm was
ripped off at a Dade City farm when he accidentally stuck it in a
tomato sorting machine while his mother worked nearby. Doctors were
unable to reattach the limb because the injury was so severe. The
boy was listed in good condition Monday at Tampa General Hospital.
   With their parents working in the fields from sunrise to sunset
and few available day-care services, hundreds of migrant children
are left to fend for themselves in empty homes or busy fields.
   ``We see the evidence all the time _ cut fingers because the
children stuck them in a fan, burns because the children were hungry
and tried to cook something to eat while their parents were off at
work,'' said Lourdes Villanueva, a former migrant who runs a
day-care program in Plant City.
   In the camps where migrants live, stories abound of children
maimed or killed in accidents in the fields. Many accidents go
unreported to authorities as families move on to other states,
migrants say.
   ``I remember this one woman some years back who brought a
6-month-old baby out into the fields,'' said Concha Calderon, who
has four children. ``The baby got too hot out there and died. She
didn't have anybody to watch it.''
   There is no reliable estimate of the largely undocumented migrant
farmworker population in southern Hillsborough County, but social
workers guess there are between 25,000 and 45,000 people.
   The Redlands Christian Migrant Association, the county's primary
provider of migrant day care, has only 668 available spots for
migrant children and a waiting list of 575.
   There are many more out there, but they don't qualify for
programs like Migrant Headstart because they didn't travel as
farmworkers during the year, experts say.
   ``Even a few years ago I would say there were a lot of workers
still traveling back and forth, from state to state,'' Ms.
Villanueva said. ``But now I think more are just staying here and
working odd jobs during the summer because you just can't make as
much money traveling any more.''

   Motorists would need binoculars to read

   The bill, which would require that the letters in obscene

   Under the measure, which lists about a dozen four-letter words

   Rep. V.J. Bella, a Republican, said he introduced the bill

<TEXT>
   Air Zimbabwe's wide-bodied stewardesses
have met a six-month deadline to lose weight or stay on the ground,
a newspaper reported today.
   The Herald said stewardesses who were told in December to trim
down or face permanent grounding have shed their excess baggage. It
did not say how many were involved.
   In December, the airline gave the jumbo jet attendants the
ultimatum after admitting that its cabin crews outweighed those of
most other airlines.
   Officials said at the time that some stewardesses were so big
their thighs bumped passengers as they walked between the aisles.
   The newspaper, which is published by government-owned Mass Media
Trust, today quoted an unidentified airline spokesman as saying the
stewardesses have lost weight and resumed normal duties.
   Airline officials today declined to elaborate.
   Regulations set the minumum height for stewardesses at 5 feet 4
inches and require that employees are proportionate in weight.

<HEAD>Company Agrees to Pay $15 Million in Fines, Clean Up Disposal Sites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pipeline company has been fined a record $15
million and ordered to clean up its disposal sites containing toxic
PCBs in 14 states.
   Texas Eastern Gas Pipeline Co. agreed to the 10-year cleanup,
which could cost $400 million, in a proposed consent decree filed in
U.S. District Court in Houston, the Justice Department announced
Monday.
   The cleanup will take place at up to 89 gas pipeline compressor
stations along the company's 10,000-mile-long pipeline, which runs
through Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Missouri,
Tennessee, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland
and New Jersey.
   The company used lubricating oil containing PCBs, a fire
retardant, in turbine compressors and regularly dumped liquids
including the PCBs in pits until May 1987, officials said.
   PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, are a suspected carcinogen
believed to cause birth defects, miscarriages, reproductive failures
and tumors.
   Texas Eastern also burned pipeline liquids including PCBs in open
pits at many of the 89 locations as late as 1979 and the combustion
process may have created residues of dioxin, another hazardous waste.
   The $15 million penalty will be ``a sharp reminder that failure
to comply with the environmental laws will strike a heavy blow to
the pocketbooks of would-be violators,'' said Roger Marzulla,
assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's
land and natural resources division.
   The fine is a record in civil penalties for violations of federal
environmental law in disposing of the PCBs and associated pipeline
fluids. The anticipated $400 million cleanup also appeared to be a
record for a private party in a federal environmental case, Marzulla
said.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who heads the environmental
oversight panel, said the settlement was long overdue.
   He accused the Environmental Protection Agency for not acting
fast enough.
   ``It's too bad that we had to drag EPA by the collar to get them
to take this action,'' said Lautenberg.
   But EPA spokesman David Cohen said, ``It is largely as a result
of EPA's own investigation'' that the settlement was worked out.
   ``Looking back at an investigation of this scope, I suppose that
there are points here and there where it might have been possible to
expedite matters a little faster,'' said Cohen. ``But when all
things are considered, what we got was an excellent resolution.''
   Under the decree, Texas Eastern must clean up any sites at which
PCB contamination is found in concentrations greater than 25 parts
per million in areas where public access is restricted. In sites
open to the public, the company must clean up concentrations greater
than 10 parts per million.
   The decree also requires extensive sampling and analysis of soil
on and off the sites as well as of streams and groundwater. The
groundwater monitoring program may continue for up to 20 years.
   The company said it will seek recovery of the cleanup costs from
insurance and other claims through rate hikes.
   It said it believes the $15 million penalty is ``inappropriate''
but agreed to pay it ``in order to expedite the settlement'' and
avoid ``the uncertainties of litigation.''

   An Israeli mechanized force, backed by

radio stations reported.
   They said the raiding force moved out of Israel's self-designated

about 2 miles north of the buffer zone.
   The gunships swept in firing rockets at the guerrillas of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the village, the radio stations said.
They made no mention of casualties.
   There was no immediate confirmation of the reported raid from the

<HEAD>Shamir: No Concessions to Soviets for Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who meets
with the Soviet foreign minister this week, chided Moscow for
seeking a political deal to improve relations but referred to
Mikhail Gorbachev as a ``great leader.''
   ``The Soviets keep hinting that they will renew diplomatic
relations with us if we agree to their proposal for an international
conference on the Middle East,'' Shamir said in a speech here Monday.
   ``I don't believe we should pay for the resumption of diplomatic
relations. They broke them and they should renew them.''
   In an interview published in The New York Times, Shamir praised
Gorbachev, who has instituted reforms in the Soviet Union.
   ``My observation is, to bring a new message, a new idea to such a
great country, it could be done only by a great leader,'' Shamir
told the Times.
   Less than two years ago, the leader of the hard-line Likud party
described the Soviet Union under Gorbachev as ``old wine in new
bottles.''
   In his speech, Shamir reiterated his opposition to an
international conference, which also was included in a United States
peace plan put forth by Secretary of State George Shultz in a visit
to the Middle East this week.
   Shamir, who met with Shultz in Israel on Sunday, said it is an
``illusion ... that an outside power can successfully offer its own
plan before negotiations begin.'' Indeed, he said, that ``seems only
to retard the movement towards direct negotiations, without
preconditions, which is the only way to settle disputes between
sovereign nations.''
   Israel seeks direct talks with Jordan and with Palestinian Arab
representatives who are not members of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which, Shamir said, cites Israel's destruction as a
goal in its charter.
   Shamir plans to meet Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze at the United Nations this week. There have been
several recent contacts between the countries, although they do not
have formal diplomatic relations.
   Shamir's speech to the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations included a pointed reference to Soviet support of Arab
opponents of Israel. While the Soviet Union has ``important
interests and connections in the region,'' he said, ``we would have
been much happier had it not supported elements who want to destroy
us.
   ``But there is no reason we should help enhance the Soviet
position among our enemies at the expense of our interests. That is
one of the reasons we oppose an international conference.''
   On the issue of political concessions in exchange for diplomatic
relations with the Soviet Union, Shamir said: ``In no other case
does the Soviet Union condition its diplomatic relations on
political concessions. There is no reason why Israel should be
treated differently from any other nation.''

   The state decided not to prosecute former
Gov. Evan Mecham for urging supporters to hide their support for him
if called for jury duty in his criminal trial, as prosecutors
prepared to rest their case.
   ``We do not believe it is a prosecutable case,'' Attorney General
Bob Corbin said Monday, referring to Mecham's comments in April.
``Some say it was a joke. Some say it wasn't a joke. It is a case we
do not wish to pursue.''
   Assistant Attorney General Barnett Lotstein said he expects to
rest his case today after testimony by accountant Leroy Johnson, who
told jurors Monday the Mecham campaign was badly overdrawn when it
received a $350,000 loan in October 1986.
   Mecham and Willard Mecham, his brother and 1986 campaign
treasurer, are charged with concealing the loan on financial reports
required by the state. They have denied the charges.
   ``They haven't proved anything,'' the ousted Republican governor
told reporters Monday. Prosecutors have failed to present anything
``that hasn't been public information for seven months.''
   Mecham says he was joking when he said at an April 18 Republican
legislative district meeting that supporters, if called for jury
duty in his trial, should ``have a lapse of memory'' regarding their
support for him.
   Four days later, Corbin began an investigation into whether
Mecham violated any law, including one that prohibits asking
somebody to commit a crime or help commit a crime.
   ``I don't know why he opened the investigation in the first
place,'' Mecham defense attorney Michael Scott said after being told
of Corbin's decision. ``Anyone who knows anything about the
statement knows it was said tongue-in-cheek at a private meeting.''
   On Monday, former top gubernatorial aide Donna Carlson testified
that she warned Mecham during the campaign to distance himself from
the man who loaned him the money, Tempe developer Barry Wolfson.
   Also, former Mecham Finance Committee member Vern Gasser read the
jury a set of notes he took during a committee meeting in the fall
of 1986. The notes say ``show Evan borrowed money'' and ``don't show
borrowed money,'' and some say they appear to reflect a discussion
on whether to disclose the loan.
   However, Gasser said he couldn't recall the conversation or what
the notes meant. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Ryan
allowed Gasser to read the notes despite defense objections.
   Mecham is charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents, and faces up to 22 years in
prison if convicted on all counts. Willard Mecham faces three
similar counts and up to 9{ years in prison if convicted.
   Mecham took office in January 1987. He was removed from office
April 4 when the Senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment
counts.

<HEAD>Showdown Over Restoration of Lost Wages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 4,500 wood mill workers went on
strike in three states in a showdown over efforts to restore wages
and benefits lost two years ago.
   ``We're prepared to stay out till doomsday, and the way things
are going that may not be very long,'' Sam Moore, a union local
president in Sweet Home, said as the strike began Monday.
   The strike shut down 18 wood products operations in the Oregon,
Washington and Montana, affecting Willamette Industries Inc. of
Portland, Champion International Corp. of Stamford, Conn., and DAW
Forest Products Co. of Lake Oswego.
   The walkout followed the collapse last week of negotiations with
the International Woodworkers of America-U.S. and the Western
Council of Industrial Workers.
   The Portland-based unions have vowed to restore wages and
benefits lost in 1986 after a series of unsuccessful strikes.
   ``We already took a 17 percent wage cut and two-year freeze,''
Ken Reynolds said as he walked a picket line outside a Willamette
sawmill in Lebanon. ``We'd have another two-year freeze if we accept
(Willamette's last offer). That doesn't cut it.''
   The first step toward restoration was taken last week when the
unions announced a tentative agreement with Bohemia Inc. of Eugene.
The four-year pact largely restored wages lost two years ago, union
officials said.
   The unions want to use the Bohemia agreement as an industry
standard, but other companies have rejected it.
   The International Woodworkers bargains for 450 workers at
Champion's Roseburg plywood plant. The other union represents about
200 Champion workers at a Klickitat, Wash., sawmill, and 1,800
Champion workers at sawmills and plywood plants at Missoula, Bonner
and Libby, Mont.
   The two unions also represent about 1,300 Oregon workers at five
lumber mills, four plywood mills, two wood products plants, a
machine shop and a logging shop operated by Willamette in Lebanon,
Sweet Home, Dallas and Albany.
   The International Woodworkers also represents a DAW sawmill in
Bend and the other union represents a DAW plywood plant in Redmond.
Each mill has about 400 union workers.
   Willamette spokeswoman said the company's three-year offer
included bonuses the first two years and a 3.5 percent wage increase
the third year. The average plywood worker makes $9.77 per hour, she
said.
   Union leaders oppose bonuses because the base wage rate remains
the same, although annual wages are boosted.
   Industry sources say Bohemia offered increases of 5 percent the
first year and 4 percent in each of the next three years.
   In 1986, the International Woodworkers and the Lumber, Production
and Industrial Workers, which later became the WCIW, staged a
5{-week strike against Weyerhaeuser, affecting 7,500 workers in the
biggest regional timber walkout in the last 25 years.
   That year, 1,100 other workers walked off their jobs at
Willamette Industries and other job actions struck DAW, WI Forest
Products of Lake Oswego and Champion International.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Resigns in Palme Probe Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice Minister Anna-Greta Leijon
resigned today after disclosures she authorized an unsupervised
freelance investigation into the 1986 assassination of Prime
Minister Olof Palme.
   Her resignation was intended to head off a vote of no-confidence
in Parliament that could have toppled the minority government of
Palme's successor, Ingvar Carlsson.
   Carlsson said he regretted Mrs. Leijon's departure and would
likely appoint her to a new Cabinet if his Social Democratic Party
is returned to office after elections next September.
   Opposition leaders accused her of overstepping her authority by
bypassing the official investigation into the Palme killing and
approving a secret probe by publisher Ebbe Carlsson, who is not
related to the prime minister.
   Public furor grew over reports the publisher's
government-assigned bodyguard was caught smuggling illegal
wiretapping equipment into Sweden and that the probe was funded by a
$343,000 contribution from a banker.
   Bengt Westerberg, the Liberal Party leader, said questions
remained about the role in the unauthorized probe of the Security
Police, which supplied Ebbe Carlsson with a bodyguard and unofficial
support.
   The publisher was investigating possible Iranian involvement in
Palme's murder. Under the theory, Palme was killed because he
uncovered and tried to halt illegal arms sales to Iran by a private
weapons manufacturer.
   Conservative Party leader Carl Bildt welcomed Mrs. Leijon's
resignation. ``If people want to remain confident in their faith in
Sweden as a society of justice, this was the only possible
decision,'' he said.
   The prime minister said Industry Minister Thage G. Peterson would
be acting justice minister until the next election.
   Mrs. Leijon, 49, was the third justice minister to resign since
the Social Democrats took office in 1982.
   In October, Sten Wickbom quit after a convicted spy escaped while
on an unguarded conjugal furlough from prison. In 1983, Ove Rainer
resigned for allegedly taking advantage of tax loopholes.
   Analysts said the Leijon affair threatened to hurt the Social
Democrats in balloting next September.
   An opinion survey published last weekend showed the Social
Democrats polling 44.7 percent against a combined 43.5 percent for
the three non-socialist opposition parties.
   The balance of power is held by the small Communist Party.
   The Social Democrats, who have been in office for all but six
years since World War II, have 159 seats in the 349-member
legislature.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Federal Agents Seize Cash from Robinson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents seized $21,000 in cash from the
Chicago apartment and business office of Noah Robinson, Democratic
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson's half-brother, newspapers
reported today.
   Robinson, 45, was arrested Saturday in Greenville, S.C., on
charges of hiring someone to attack a witness in the slaying of a
former employee.
   Robinson has denied the charges and accused officials of
targeting him because of Jackson's high profile and of trying to
turn him into ``the Billy Carter of the Jesse Jackson campaign.''
   Robinson's Chicago attorney, Jerome Rotenburg, said cash seized
was from Robinson's chain of fast food restaurants, according to
today's editions of the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times.
   Rotenburg's office telephones went unanswered Monday night, and
FBI spokesman Jim Kuntzelman said no information could be released.
   The Tribune also said federal authorities had seized the records
of Robinson's businesses in Chicago and were examining them.
   Robinson on Monday posted $50,000 on a $500,000 bond on charges
of accessory to a felony, intimidation of a witness, obstruction of
justice and conspiracy.
   ``I have never been involved in criminal anything,'' he told
courtroom observers and reporters while awaiting his bond hearing.
   Police arrested another man at Robinson's Chicago residence on
Sunday and charged him with being an accessory to the stabbing of
the witness, Janice Denise Rosemond, who survived the attack in her
Greenville apartment in December 1987.
   Ms. Rosemond was a witness to the murder of Leroy ``Hambone''
Barber, a former employee of Robinson who was shot outside a
building owned by Robinson in downtown Greenville, authorities said.
   The man arrested in the Chicago apartment, Holandus ``Jake''
Oliver, 41, was named as a co-conspirator in one of the warrants
filed against Robinson, but authorities declined to elaborate on
what role Oliver allegedly played in the stabbing.
   Robinson said Oliver worked for him in 1974 and recently watched
Robinson's apartment in Chicago when he was out of town.
   Bond for Oliver was set Monday at $100,000.
   Ms. Rosemond was stabbed after testifying before a grand jury
about Barber's death. She later recanted her testimony.
   Robinson said he believes the charges against him stem from his
attempts to help ex-convicts and others in need and from political
forces trying to derail Jackson's bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Greenville Police Chief Mike Bridges said Robinson's arrest ``has
nothing to do with political motivations. When we felt we had enough
to charge him and arrest him that's what we did. We treated this
case like any other case.''

<HEAD>Computer Glitch Causes Data To Vanish From Air Traffic Controller
Screens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critical information is disappearing momentarily
from air traffic controllers' screens in airports for Dallas,
Houston, Los Angeles and Atlanta because of a computer glitch, a
newspaper reported today.
   Information on altitude, airspeed, aircraft types, call signs and
destinations vanish from radar screens for up to 20 seconds, said
the Dallas Morning News, quoting Federal Aviation Administration
officials.
   FAA officials do not believe the error in a computer program
presents a hazard to safety, Lawrence Parrent, assistant air traffic
manager at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, said Monday.
   ``The radar has not failed,'' Parrent said. ``The primary target
is still there.'' The radar image and a four-digit number assigned
to each aircraft, known as a ``target'' by controllers, remain on
the screen.
   Controllers are concerned about the glitch and are monitoring the
FAA's progress in fixing it, said Edward F. Mullin, a local
representative of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
   ``It's a new program and there are some software problems,'' he
said. ``I don't think that's anything unusual. We're not totally
comfortable with it, but they're working hard on the system.''
   The information disappears when the program ``detects a glitch in
the system,'' Parrent said.
   When information is about to disappear, an alarm sounds, and
controllers have up to five seconds to write down the information or
memorize it, FAA officials told the Morning News. Controllers handle
up to 10 aircraft at a time.
   The new program offers many features that improve the margin of
safety, and ``bugs'' will be worked out, Parrent said.
   However, the newspaper said some aviation experts and controllers
voiced concern that, although horizontal distance between aircraft
still can be tracked on the screen, the glitch could cause problems.
   The risk is exacerbated if the problem occurs when aircraft are
in a holding pattern because of bad weather, said Len Nahmi, a
California-based airline captain and air safety investigator.
   It is common for aircraft to be in holding patterns with altitude
separations of 1,000 feet in weather that severely limits
visibility, Nahmi said.
   If a pilot deviated from an assigned altitude when information
disappeared, the controller would be unable to detect the change,
and a collision would be likely, he said.
   Parrent acknowleged the glitches have made some controllers
uneasy.
   ``It does cause tense moments in the control room,'' he said.
``But we would not run that program if there was a derogation of
safety.''

   Radical students threw firebombs and
rocks at police and barricaded streets today and their leaders vowed
to defy the government and march to communist North Korea to press
for reunification.
   Fierce fighting erupted around Soongshil University when radical
students screaming anti-government slogans poured out of the school
to attack riot police. Several officers hit by firebombs were
covered in orange flames before other police extinguished the fires.
   Radical students from across the capital had gathered at the
school to mourn a Shoonshil student who died Monday of wounds
suffered when he set fire to himself two days earlier in an
anti-government protest.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship'' and ``Yankee go home,''
masked students yelled as they hurled firebombs, rocks and bricks at
riot troopers huddling behind shields. Police also hurled rocks.
   Police rifle squads and armored vans fired hundreds of rounds of
tear gas, but were forced back from the road in front of the school
several times by students armed with wooden poles and iron bars.
   Students blocked one road with two 15-foot-high basketball
backboards.
   Several police officers and students were injured by rocks and
other missiles, but police had no figures. Police did not report any
arrests.
   The front of thecampus was draped in black mourning cloth and
protest banners as students inside the school stood watch over the
coffin of Park Rae-chun. Park was the third student to commit ritual
suicide as an anti-government protest since May 15.
   Fighting erupted after a procession of students bearing Park's
body marched from a Seoul hospital.
   In the southern city of Taejon, students tried to march out of
Hannam University, but were driven back by riot police firing tear
gas.
   Radical students held peaceful rallies at other colleges in Seoul
and other cities to prepare for a march Friday to North Korea in an
attempt to unify the two Koreas.
   ``March to the border to realize unification and drive out the
foreign forces from our land,'' said a leader at a rally at Joongang
University in Seoul.
   National Police Director Cho Chong-suk said the march plans were
a threat to national security and that students defying the ban on
the march would be arrested and prosecuted.
   ``Any attempts to take part in the action or any other illegal
acts will be dealt with severely,'' Cho warned in a statement.
   Up to 60,000 riot police will be deployed to prevent students
marching from Seoul to the border and to step up security around key
government buildings and college campuses, police officials said.
   Radical students planned to march to the border truce site of
Panmunjom, which is off limits to civilians, to meet with North
Korean students.
   Opposition parties urged the government to hold talks with
student leaders to reach a peaceful settlement rather than resort to
a violent crackdown.
   But the opposition disagrees with the march, saying contacts with
North Korea must be left to official channels.
   Police arrested 148 students in Seoul on Sunday when they tried
to go to the edge of the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas
for a rally to promote Friday's march.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, insist
that the two Koreas must be reunited at all costs. They say they are
not pro-communist.
   Student leaders claim the United States enforces partition of the
peninsula, divided since 1945, so it can rule South Korea as a
virtual colony. Radicals have been demanding the withdrawal of the
42,000 U.S. troops based here under a defense pact.
   But many South Koreans believe North Korea is determined to
forcefully unite the peninsula under its control.
   North Korea, which invaded South Korea in 1950 and sparked the
Korean War, has staged attacks against South Korea over the years.

   Randy Travis, country music's newest
success story, displaced the Statler Brothers as the fans' favorite
in an annual popularity poll.
   Travis, 29, won four honors Monday night, including entertainer
of the year and No. 1 male artist, at the 22nd annual Music City
News country music awards.
   Travis, a former short-order cook, also won single of the year
for ``Forever and Ever, Amen'' and album of the year for ``Always &
Forever.''
   His four honors were double those won last year by the Statler
quartet, who had won 36 since their first award in 1971.
   ``Everybody can relate to our songs,'' Travis said after the
syndicated television special at the Grand Ole Opry House. ``We
really look long and hard for the right song. A song like `Forever
and Ever, Amen' that has a good message, it's hard not to like it.''
   The Statlers, of Staunton, Va., were voted group of the year for
the 17th time and won best video for ``Maple Street Memories.''
   Former rodeo barrel racer Reba McEntire was chosen No. 1 female
singer for the fourth straight year.
   ``I hope you all aren't getting tired of seeing me up here,'' she
said. ``I sure am enjoying it.''
   In the emotional highlight of the presentations, Conway Twitty
received a standing ovation as he tearfully accepted the Living
Legend Award for at least 25 years of musical achievement.
   In his acceptance speech, he introduced his mother in the
audience and said, ``See, mama. I told you not to worry.''
   Other winners were: Ray Stevens, comedian of the year; ``Maple
Street Memories,'' video of the year, Statler Brothers; Ricky Van
Shelton, Star of Tomorrow; Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Linda
Ronstadt, vocal collaboration of the year; The Judds, vocal duo of
the year; ``Nashville Now,'' country music television series of the
year, The Nashville Network cable channel; ``Grand Ole Opry Live,''
country music TV special of the year, The Nashville Network; Ricky
Skaggs, top instrumentalist; and The Chuck Wagon Gang, top gospel
group.
   The two-hour awards show was hosted by the Statler Brothers and
Barbara Mandrell. It will be seen on a delayed basis in some cities.
   Winners and finalists were chosen by subscribers to The Music
City News, a monthly country music publication in Nashville.
   Travis became country music's top star in less than three years.
His albums ``Always and Forever'' and ``Storms of Life'' have both
sold more than 2 million. His ``I Told You So'' is currently the No.
1 record on the country music charts.
   He was cooking and singing part time when discovered at a
Nashville nightclub.

   A stagnant weather system hovered over north-central states
today, turning up the heat from Montana to Wisconsin, while much of
the nation was cool or wet.
   Showers and thunderstorms lingered over parts of Georgia, Alabama
and Florida early this morning. Rain also fell on northern
California and the Pacific Northwest.
   Skies were clear over Nevada, the Mississippi Valley, the Ohio
Valley and the upper Great Lakes region early today while a few
thunderstorms were reported in central Nebraska.
   In Wisconsin on Monday, Green Bay set a record high with 93

Heating in Eagan.
   The high for the nation Monday was 108 degrees at Glendive, Mont.
   Strong winds blasted Utah on Monday and a lake wind advisory was
issued for today.
   In Scottsmoor, Fla., high winds tossed a mobile home onto two
cars and then into an irrigation pond, but relatives said the two
women and four children who were trapped inside swam to safety with
minor injuries.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern parts of Alabama and Georgia into the eastern Gulf Coast
and Florida; showers and a few thunderstorms from the central and
northern Pacific coast region into the northern Rockies; sunny skies

<HEAD>Defense Secretary Urges Japan to Increase Defense Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci praised the
Japanese government for taking on a greater share of its own
defense, but urged it to contribute more toward Western security.
   Speaking to the Japan National Press Club on Monday, Carlucci
noted that Japan has in this decade taken on defense of sea-lanes up
to 1,000 miles offshore and begun a five-year procurement plan of
beefing up its forces.
   He said Japan had done away with its self-imposed limit of
spending just 1 percent of its gross national product on defense and
that the government had also pledged to pay all non-salary
allowances and expenses for Japanese workers on U.S. bases here by
1990.
   ``Japan does more than it often gets credit for,'' he said. ``I
want to make equally clear today that still more remains to be
done.''
   Carlucci urged Japan to increase defense spending, since the
current program provides for what he called ``the minimum capability
Japan needs to fulfill the defense obligations it has assumed.''
   Japan also should increase its financial support for maintaining
U.S. military personnel stationed here, which costs the U.S.
government $3 billion annually, he said.
   Carlucci also called on Japan to boost overseas economic aid to
such developing nations such as Pakistan, Portugal, Turkey and
Afghanistan, which he called ``nations in which aid could advance
our overall security.''
   He said the West should strengthen controls on its exports to the
East to keep its technological lead over the Soviet bloc and should
not be lulled by last week's superpower summit in Moscow.
   ``Until we see some tangible changes we should not change our
policies,'' he said. ``We are still facing a serious military
threat.''

<HEAD>Demonstrators Block Demolition of Buildings Around Golden Temple</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEEPAK SHARMA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 1,000 demonstrators today blocked
the government from wrecking buildings around the Golden Temple to
create a security corridor free of hiding places for Sikh militants,
authorities said.
   The crowd gathered on a road and prevented construction vehicles
from moving in to demolish the buildings within 30 yards of the
holiest shrine of the Sikh religion.
   Sikh militants have used the temple as a base in their battle for
an independent homeland.
   Militants shot and killed a Sikh couple at a village near
Amritsar on Monday, the United News of India said.
   The killings raised to 1,259 the number of people killed this
year in attacks blamed on Sikh radicals. Many of the victims have
been members of the majority Hindu community, but the militants have
also targeted moderate Sikhs.
   Most of the demonstrators in Amritsar were tenants of the
affected buildings, an Amritsar district government official said.
The demonstrators were demanding that they be provided alternate
housing before they were evicted, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said senior government officials were negotiating with the
demonstrators. ``The demolitions will not begin until the problem is
resolved,'' he said.
   Plans for the security corridor were launched after a 10-day
police siege of the temple ended on May 18. More than 200 militants
surrendered to police during the siege that left 46 people dead,
including 41 suspected radicals and five civilians caught in
crossfire..
   Police found it difficult to maintain a cordon around the shrine
because the maze of alleys, shops and houses next to the complex
provided cover for radicals.
   Sarbjeet Singh, the top government officer in the district, said
workers would demolish 522 properties by the end of the year and
create a corridor 1.7 miles in circumference.
   The entire project, scheduled to be completed within two years,
was expected to cost $115 million, which would include expenses to
buy the land and relocate families and businesses, he said.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are in a
majority in northern Punjab state, where Amritsar is.
   Sikh militants have been agitating since 1982 for an independent
homeland in Punjab. They say they are discriminated against by
Hindus, who comprise 80 percent of the country's population.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in slack European trading this
morning, though many dealers said they expected little fluctuation
before release of U.S. trade figures in a week.
   Gold prices also were slightly lower.
   Dealers in Frankfurt said the market continued to react to the
West German Bundesbank's recent sales of the U.S. currency and
opposition to a further dollar increase signaled by central bank
president Karl Otto Poehl.
   But in Milan and Frankfurt, traders predicted there won't be much
movement in the dollar until the U.S. trade figures for April are
released next Tuesday.
   One Milan trader said he expected the April trade deficit to be
around $10 billion, little changed from the $9.75 billion shortfall
in March.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.30 yen to a closing 125.77 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted slightly lower at 125.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
rates:
   _ 1.7114 West German marks, down from 1.7190
   _ 1.4263 Swiss francs, down from 1.4357
   _ 5.7855 French francs, down from 5.8122
   _ 1.9219 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9303
   _ 1,272.50 Italian lire, down from 1,277.65
   _ 1.2315 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2324
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.8107 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.8025 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $463.30 a troy ounce and
at mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $463.40. Both were slightly lower than Monday's
late bid of $463.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $463.40, down from $464.50 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 36 cents to close at $464.03.
   Silver also fell in London, where it was selling at a bid price
of $7.28 a troy ounce compared with late Monday's $7.34.

   Air Zimbabwe's female flight attendants
have met a six-month deadline to lose weight, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Herald said flight attendants who were told in December to
trim down or face permanent grounding have met the ultimatum. It did
not say how many employees were involved.
   In issuing the order in December, the airline said its cabin
crews outweighed those of most other airlines.
   The Herald, which is published by government-owned Mass Media
Trust, today quoted an unidentified airline spokesman as saying the
flight attendants have lost weight. Airline officials today declined
to elaborate.
   Regulations set the minumum height for female flight attendants
at 5 feet 4 inches and require that they be proportionate in weight.

   An American Airlines jetliner carrying 105
people returned safely to Los Angeles International Airport after an
air traffic controller noticed fuel leaking from a wing.
   American Flight 2223, a Boeing 737 loaded with 16,000 pounds of
fuel, took off at 10:37 a.m. Monday on a flight to San Jose when an
air traffic controller notified the pilot he noticed fuel leaking
from the right wing.
   The pilot then declared an emergency and returned to the airport
20 minutes later, said Elly Brekke, a spokeswoman for the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   Firefighters stood by, but the passengers and crew left the
aircraft without having to use emergency chutes, Ms. Brekke said.
   The leak was caused by a faulty fuel cap, according to Steve
McGregor, an American Airlines spokesman in Fort Worth, Texas. The
plane carried a full load of 100 passengers, plus two pilots and
three flight attendants, he said.
   The FAA, Brekke said, sent inspectors to investigate the incident.

<TEXT>
   Hashemi Rafsanjani was re-elected speaker
of Iran's parliament today, consolidating his hold on political and
military power.
   Rafsanjani's re-election came five days after Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini named him commander-in-chief of the armed forces in the
wake of two major battlefield defeats in the war against Iraq.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said 187 of the 192 parliamentary deputies whose
credentials have been approved since elections in April and May
voted for Rafsanjani. Five abstained.
   Rafsanjani, 53, has been speaker since 1980.
   Radicals, including many Rafsanjani supporters, made sweeping
gains in the elections at the expense of conservatives, who have
blocked economic reforms.
   The credentials of other elected deputies in the 270-seat Majlis,
or parliament, have either been passed to an investigating committee
for scrutiny following objections from other deputies or have not
yet been approved, IRNA reported.
   Rafsanjani is also Khomeini's representative on the Supreme
Defense Council, which determines Iran's strategy in the 7{-year war
with Iraq. He sits on the Council for the Expediency of State
Decrees, formed earlier this year by Khomeini to push radical
economic reforms through parliament.
   Rafsanjani has strong links with the Revolutionary Guards Corps,
which is now more powerful than the Iranian army.
   The 87-year-old Khomeini, patriarch of Iran's Islamic revolution,
has been reported in poor health. Speculation that his condition was
deteriorating was heightened when he relinquished his constitutional
position as commander-in-chief to Rafsanjani, a middle-ranking
cleric.
   Khomeini has designated a senior cleric, Ayatollah Hussein-Ali
Montazeri, as his successor. But many leading figures, including
Rafsanjani, oppose Montazeri.
   Khomeini's appointment underlined that Rafsanjani, who has long
been close to the patriarch, retains his confidence and is being
groomed to hold great power in the post-Khomeini era.
   The election was the most fiercely contested since the Islamic
revolution toppled the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979. The gains
in parliament by the radicals, supported by Khomeini, prompted
allegations by some prominent conservatives who failed to win
re-election that the polling was rigged.
   It sharpened divisions between radicals, seeking a centralized
state-run economy, and the conservatives, who are backed by the
wealthy merchant class.
   The elections touched off clashes between Khomeini supporters
backed by the Revolutionary Guards and protesters in several cities,
diplomatic sources reported. Several people were reported killed
when the guards opened fire on demonstrators.
   Iran's best known opposition politician, former Prime Minister
Mehdi Bazargan, distributed an open letter last week accusing
Khomeini of ``erroneous policies'' in the war with Iraq and making
the Islamic Republic an object of hate around the world.
   Reports reaching Paris said Bazargan's criticism triggered a wave
of arrests, but it was not known if Bazargan himself had been
detained.
   Bazargan's small Freedom Movement is the only opposition faction
permitted to function openly in Iran and has been constantly
harassed by Khomeini militants in recent years.

<HEAD>Striking Writers Schedule More Contract Talks With Producers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking scriptwriters ended a 12-hour
negotiating session with television producers early today,
scheduling a fifth straight day of talks as the walkout enters its
14th week.
   ``We're not characterizing how the meeting went,'' Writers Guild
of America spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said early today when asked if
the continuing talks meant some hope for a breakthrough.
   The latest session, at the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers headquarters, ended at 2 a.m. today, Ms. Rhoden
said. The next round of talks was scheduled for 1:30 this afternoon,
she added.
   The two sides began meeting Friday.
   Ms. Rhoden declined to comment on the issues discussed.
   The writers walked out March 7 in a dispute centering on payments
or residuals for reruns of one-hour television shows. Demand for
such programs in rerun, or syndication, is declining, and the
producers want to tie payments to a show's success in the rerun
market.
   The two sides also have been at odds over writers' demands for
more creative control over changes made in scripts during filming
and more on- and off-screen credit.
   The guild has signed full-term contracts with about 80
independent producers, but the alliance contends none of its large
members has signed and the producers who did defect employ only a
fraction of the writers.

   Political discontent among Beijing University
students broke into the open today as students put up illegal
posters demanding democracy and criticizing government corruption.
   Dozens of anonymous posters blanketed bulletin boards on campus
and spilled onto nearby buildings, some with large characters
scrawled in black paint on sheets of newspaper and others written in
tiny characters on notebook pages.
   ``China faces an all-out crisis,'' said one poster. ``The most
basic human rights are imperiled.''
   Several posters demanded a more open press, complaining that
Chinese often learn about events in their own country through the
foreign media. One quoted the preamble to the U.S. Declaration of
Independence, with its defense of ``life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.''
   Students said they planned to march Wednesday from campus to
Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center of power in Beijing, to
dramatize their demands. Street marches are illegal without police
permission.
   A graduate student at Beijing University slain last week in a
brawl outside a liquor store. On Friday, about 1,000 students
marched to Tiananmen Square and met with officials to demand
improved security and the arrest of the killers. Police arrested six
suspects within 48 hours of the killing.
   Since Friday, hundreds of students have gathered nightly around
campus bulletin boards, holding debates and encouraging each other
to draw a larger lesson from the killing.
   ``People are concerned about more than just this incident,'' said
one girl. ``They want to do something for the living.''
   Several times in recent months university students have put up
posters criticizing government bureaucracy and demanding more state
funds for education. The new posters repeated those themes, but also
demanded democracy and freedom for the first time since
pro-democracy protests swept China in the winter of 1986-87.
   Those protests, in which thousands of students marched through
Beijing and other major cities, led to a government crackdown on
liberalism and the ouster of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang for
his alleged tolerance toward the students.
   Students since have been careful not to raise the themes of
democracy and freedom.
   A Beijing University freshman said today that students are
divided over whether agitation now will help or hurt the cause of
democracy.
   ``The 7th National People's Congress was the most democratic
ever,'' he said, referring to the national legislative session held
in March and April, at which delegates were encouraged for the first
time to debate selected issues.
   ``We see democracy moving forward slowly. But if conditions
become upset, the government will again rule with a firm hand,'' he
said. ``Perhaps the steps we take will not lead us to our goals _
perhaps just the opposite.''
   Other students acknowledged that they lack the support of wider
groups in society. Most urban workers are more concerned with the 11
percent inflation rate than such abstract issues as democracy.
   One poster urged the students to join in the planned march
Wednesday to ``propagate among the masses the necessity of democracy
and rule of law.''
   Another claimed, ``A small breeze at Beijing University can raise
up a storm nationwide.''
   One poster accused the government of paying more attention to
crushing student protests than stamping out official corruption.
   ``Even a dog that is wronged gives a few barks. But we Beijing
University students aren't even as good as a dog,'' it taunted,
challeging students to speak out.

<NOTE>Eds: Top 9 grafs new with Gingrich comments. Picks up 4th graf pvs,
House ethical guidelines.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading critic of House Speaker Jim Wright
said today he isn't sure Wright was wrong in using an aide to help
write a book, but the speaker's activities should be investigaged.
   The aide was paid $2,000 from official congressional accounts for
expenses during a 1984 trip to Texas to oversee final editing of a
privately published book by Wright, House records show.
   ``I'm not sure, frankly, whether we have a problem here or not
with this particular case,'' Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said on the
CBS show ``This Morning.''
   ``There's clearly a legitimate public policy role served in
writing books,'' Gingrich said, ``The question would come, whether
the primary job of that staffer was to write a book which was being
written purely for profit, or whether that was a natural part of his
job, doing something that reflected a public policy interest.''
   ``I think every member of Congress has at times used their staff
in a legitimate way to look at serious public policy pronouncements
or serious efforts to influence public policy,'' Gingrich said.
   But he reiterated previous calls for a House Ethics Committee
investigation of Wright's activities.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., also said Wright should be
investigated. Frank said he doesn't consider accusations against
Wright valid, but feels that an investigation would help restore
public confidence.
   The book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' published by a
longtime Fort Worth friend of the speaker, brought Wright nearly
$55,000 in royalties.
   Matthew Cossolotto, who has since left Wright's staff, said in a
telephone interview Monday that his Texas trip was the culmination
of several months of on-and-off work in Wright's Capitol Hill office
to help the Texas Democrat draft the book's manuscript.
   House ethical guidelines allow wide latitude in the use of staff
members, but stipulate that ``Employees may not be compensated from
public funds to perform nonofficial, personal or campaign activities
on behalf of the member.''
   Records maintained by the House show $2,078.27 paid to Cossolotto
for hotel accommodations ``while on official business,'' car rental
and meals from Oct. 22 to Nov. 14, 1984, when Cossolotto said he was
in Fort Worth to complete work on the book.
   At the time, Wright was House majority leader, the No. 2
leadership post.
   Cossolotto said he spent ``a good chunk of time'' _ perhaps 150
to 200 hours _ between mid-1984, when Wright assigned him to work on
the book at a staff meeting, and his trip to Fort Worth. The book is
largely a compilation of Wright's speeches, sayings and anecdotes.
   ``It was not full time in any particular week,'' Cossolotto said.
``I would collect some things, read some stuff, talk to the majority
leader. It was hit and miss. The big crunch was down in Fort Worth.''
   During the trip, which was arranged by Wright's office,
Cossolotto said he worked with the publisher, read proofs and made
final corrections on the book. He said he flew to Fort Worth on a
commercial flight, but did not know how that was paid for. The House
financial records for the period do not show any air fare attributed
to Cossolotto.
   The book deal was among cases of alleged questionable activities
by Wright cited in requests for an investigation of Wright by the
House ethics committee. The panel met last week without deciding how
to proceed, and is scheduled to resume consideration of the matter
Thursday.
   In an interview with the Washington Post, which first reported
the aide's work on the book Monday, Cossolotto said he was ``a
little uncomfortable'' with the assignment and did not know whether
it was proper under House rules.
   Asked Monday whether he reported that uneasiness to any of his
superiors, or sought assurances from them, he answered: ``That's
sort of a touchy one. I'm not sure if I did.''
   Earlier news reports have pointed out that Wright has collected
nearly $55,000 in royalties from the book, receiving $3.25 for each
copy of the slim $5.95 volume. It was published by Carlos Moore, a
Fort Worth friend of Wright who also was paid more than $250,000 by
Wright's re-election committee in 1985 and 1986, while Wright was
collecting the royalties.
   Wright's office would not comment on the matter Monday. In an
interview with the Post, however, the speaker defended Cossolotto's
assignment and said the amount of time the aide had spent was
``rather negligible.''
   ``If he gave some time to try to help put together a book that
would demonstrate to the public my philosophy, my basic beliefs,
that wouldn't be too far afield from the public business,'' Wright
told the newspaper.
   Another Wright staff member, press aide George Mair, is
collaborating with the speaker on a book looking at the history of
Congress over its first 200 years and in particular at those who
have held the speaker's office.
   Mair was hired by the speaker on a short-term contract last Dec.
1, and his $65,000-a-year contract was renewed in May.
   One news account of the contract renewal said Mair was kept on to
help with a number of projects, including the book. But Mair said
Monday he and Wright are working on the book totally outside office
hours.

<DATELINE>RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli-appointed mayor
of the West Bank town of El-Bireh was stabbed in the chest today in
an apparent assassination attempt by Palestinian militants.
   The stabbing of Hassan Tawil, in his 70s, follows repeated
demands by underground leaders of the 6-month-old Palestinian
uprising that he and scores of other Israeli-appointed officials
resign their jobs in the occupied West Bank.
   Tawil was taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital, where officials said
he was in stable condition after surgery.
   He was stabbed once with a ``very long knife'' that pierced his
heart, diaphragm, liver and stomach, said the officials, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the military government in the
West Bank, said Tawil was attacked near the city hall in El-Bireh, a
town of mostly Moslems about nine miles north of Jerusalem.
   Israel radio said a knife was found near the scene of the attack.
   Yusef Taher, one of four members of the El-Bireh city council,
blamed the attack on Palestinian militants and said, ``I had hoped
we would not descend to the level of assassination.''
   The army set up roadblocks and imposed a curfew on El-Bireh,
confining the 10,000 residents to their homes.
   Hussein Tawil, a son of the mayor, said a driver who also acted
as a guard was with his father at the time of the attack. He said
the man was being questioned by police.
   Three Israeli soldiers guarded Tawil's room at Ramallah Hospital
and prevented even family members from entering.
   When Hussein Tawil appeared, he said, ``Let me in. I want to see
my father.'' But soldiers pushed him away.
   Two army jeeps were parked outside the hospital and about 20
soldiers surrounded the building.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem condemned the
attack.
   Israel army radio said it received an anonymous telephone call
from a Hebrew-speaking man who took responsibility for the stabbing
but did not identify any group as having carried out the attack.
   The radio quoted him as saying: ``We are sick of the stone
throwers. That's why we did it,'' implying the attackers were Jewish
extremists.
   But both diplomatic sources and Palestinian journalists
discounted the call, saying the attack was more likely the work of
Palestinian militants.
   Tawil was one of three mayors appointed by the Israeli government
in September 1986 as part of an effort to gain cooperation from
Palestinian moderates. The Palestinian mayors replaced Israeli
officials who had been running the municipalities.
   The appointments immediately provoked opposition in the West
Bank, where Palestinian extremists often have threatened to
assassinate those who cooperate with Israel's government.
   In March 1986, Mayor Zafer El-Masri of Nablus was slain in front
of his office three months after Israel appointed him to govern the
West Bank's largest city. Last October, two Palestine Liberation
Organization members were sentenced to life in prison for the
slaying.
   Today's attack follows repeated calls in underground leaflets for
Israel-appointed mayors and city officials to resign. Such leaflets,
signed by the PLO-backed United Leadership of the Uprising, have
prompted the resignation of about 400 Arab policemen.
   According to army officials, there are Israeli-appointed mayors
in about a dozen towns and cities in the West Bank. Heads of about
85 village councils also are appointed by the military government.
   Meron Benveniste, an Israeli expert on the West Bank, said
attacks on such Palestinian officials could be predicted once the
uprising began to ebb.
   ``It was clear that once (the uprising) would die down a bit,
they would start doing their accounting. They told them to resign
and they didn't want to,'' he said.
   On Monday, Israeli troops opened fire at rioting Arabs in the
occupied Gaza Strip hours after Richard Shifter, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for human rights, toured the area with U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Pickering. A 9-month-old Palestinian child lost an
eye in the shooting.
   Three other Arabs were injured Monday in protests in the strip's
Jabaliya refugee camp. In the West Bank, a 16-year-old Palestinian
boy was wounded when troops chased stone-throwers.
   Also Monday, the army reopened high schools for 36,000 students
in the West Bank and released more than 100 Arab teen-agers from
jail so they could attend classes.
   Schools had been closed since February and Israeli officials said
their reopening indicates a waning of the anti-occupation uprising,
in which 202 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed.
   West Bank military government spokesman Olivier Rawofitz reported
90 percent attendance that he said showed a wish to return to normal
life. But students vowed to stage protests after classes.

   Hundreds of thousands of black
workers and students stayed home for a second day today in a
nationwide protest strike over apartheid. Police said seven people
were killed and more than 20 injured in violence overnight.
   Strike supporters and transport companies said the protest eased
today in many areas and worker attendance increased. But
participation near 100 percent was reported in other places.
   Police reported more than two dozen incidents of violence between
Monday evening and dawn today, including many firebombings and
stonings of homes, buses and trains. Twenty-one arrests were
reported.
   One black youth was killed by police shotgun fire after municipal
officers were stoned, police said. The other six blacks who died,
including three children, were killed in shootings and a hand
grenade attack in which the assailants were not identified.
   In the black homeland of KwaZulu, hospital officials said a bus
passenger injured in a firebomb attack early Monday had died.
   A bomb caused minor damage to a rail line in Soweto early today,
delaying some trains carrying blacks from the huge black township to
jobs in Johannesburg.
   Black union leaders had called for a three-day national protest
without specifying a strike. They said the action aims to pressure
business leaders into demanding that the white minority government
ease restrictions on the anti-apartheid movement.
   A three-day strike would be the longest nationwide protest since
the government decreed an emergency June 12, 1986 to thwart a black
revolt against apartheid, the policy of racial separation that
reserves power as well as the best schooling and living for South
Africa's 5 million whites and denies the country's 26 million blacks
a voice in national affairs.
   The boycott is the most ambitious opposition effort since the
government in February banned political activity by major
anti-apartheid groups and the Congress of South African Trade
Unions, the largest black labor federation.
   Union leaders targeted those prohibitions as well as proposed
legislation that would limit the ability of labor unions to strike.
   Frank Meintjies, spokesman for the 691,000-member congress, said
3 million people stayed home Monday and about 90 percent of those
were still out today. Other estimates said there were about 1
million strikers.
   Police declined comment on the scope of the strike on grounds
that giving publicity to it would break emergency regulations.
National police headquarters in Pretoria urged local news media to
consult their lawyers on restrictions against subversive statements
before publishing stories about the protest.
   Some business leaders were quoted Monday as saying they intend to
enforce a no-work, no-pay policy toward strikers, and Manpower
Minister Pieter du Plessis said strikers risked dismissal because
the protest was illegal.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said in a radio
editorial that the strike represented the strategy of ``those
radical activists who want to make South Africa ungovernable.''
   In Soweto, schools were empty today and many students were
expected to extend a scheduled vacation period starting next week by
staying home for the rest of this week. Bus and taxi routes were
busier than on Monday.
   Johannesburg, where sidewalks were virtually empty Monday, was
nearly as quiet this morning.
   PUTCO, whose 2,400 buses carry 300,000 passengers daily in
Transvaal and Natal provinces, said operations were back to normal
around Pretoria. Spokesman Robin Duff said service improved from
Soweto but was still only 25 percent of normal and that the stayaway
appeared more than 90 percent effective in townships east of
Johannesburg and around the port of Durban.
   South African Transport Services said rail commuter traffic was
up sharply in most areas.
   Precious-metal mines, the backbone of South Africa's export
earnings, were slightly affected, with one gold mine and three
diamond mines reporting significant stayaways Monday. Anglo American
Corp., the biggest mining company, said absenteeism was heavy Monday
at two of its coal mines, and that one mine was still affected
Tuesday.
   Milk and bread deliveries were curtailed in some areas around
Durban. Hospital services there and in Johannesburg were reported
running smoothly.
   In some areas around Johannesburg where transport was disrupted,
police used large trucks to carry people to the nearest working bus
routes.
   All of the country's seven major automobile assembly plants
remained closed.
   The union call for a protest was endorsed last week by leading
anti-apartheid clergymen and the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement said the economy ``must grind to a halt.''

<HEAD>Soviets Reportedly Delay Withdrawal From Kandahar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet troops are delaying their
pullout from Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city, Western
diplomats said today.
   Kandahar, population about 200,000, has been under siege for
several weeks and Moslem guerrillas are reportedly preparing for
another major offensive against Soviet-Afghan troops stationed there.
   Reports reaching Islamabad say Afghan insurgents have pushed
government troops to defensive positions around the outskirts of the
city.
   The Soviet Union in 1979 sent troops to Afghanistan to support
the Marxist regime. On May 15, the Soviets began a withdrawal, which
has been slowed by attacks from guerrillas.
   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a Soviet
regiment was told to cancel plans to leave Kandahar, reflecting
Soviet fears over the city's vulnerability.
   Soviet forces reportedly have left Ghazni, on the road from
Kandahar to the Afghan capital of Kabul, but some soldiers remain in
Jalalabad, where the Soviet withdrawal was launched in May.
   There have been reports of heavy fighting in the northeastern
province of Baghland.
   The Salang highway, stretching 200 miles north of Kabul to the
Soviet border, is becoming increasingly dangerous, sources said. It
was closed to civilian traffic for five days ending Sunday to allow
departing Soviet troops to move north. Diplomatic sources say the
convoys have been attacked by guerrillas and that up to 100 Soviet
soldiers were reported killed in recent clashes.
   The official Kabul radio, monitored in Islamabad, continues to
broadcast a list of guerrilla defeats and atrocities. It claimed
Monday that 93 guerrillas were killed and as many injured in recent
clashes in seven of Afghanistan's 28 provinces.
   The various reports cannot be independently confirmed.

   Fire broke out early today in two
apartments above a used furniture store, killing seven people,
including five children ranging in age from 2 to 6, authorities said.
   Six victims _ one woman and all five children _ were found
beneath a boarded-up window, said Hamilton Fire Chief Don Lickert.
   In addition, he said, the three-story, wooden-frame building had
no fire escapes and a door on the ground-floor that was the exit for
the two apartments was locked on the outside.
   Fire officials said they found one smoke detector that had no
batteries.
   The seventh victim, a man, was found in a second-floor hallway,
Lickert said. Three adults were injured, officials said.
   The fire in the building was reported at 3:48 a.m., said Fire Lt.
Joseph Stamper. Officials didn't know what caused the fire or where
it started and arson investigators were at the scene this morning.
   There were three apartments on the second floor, said the
building's owner, Elizabeth Blackburn.
   The door to the two apartments was padlocked on the outside,
apparently by residents who reached through a window to lock it at
night for security, he said. Mrs. Blackburn said she was unaware of
the padlock.
   Two windows in the building were boarded, one to keep pigeons out
of the attic, Mrs. Blackburn said. There was no indication why the
other window, where the victims were found, was boarded.
   The victims died of apparent smoke inhalation, Coroner's
Investigator Thomas Marsh said.
   Butler County Coroner Dr. Richard Burkhardt identified the
victims as Faye Dunham Reeseman and her 2-year-old son Christopher;
Lee Cooper, 30; Mary Smith, 6; Jennifer Miller, 4; and twins Wesley
and James Miller, 2.
   ``I was very close to them. I used to take them to the store,''
Mrs. Blackburn, who did not live in the building, said of the
children. ``That's the only thing I cared about, was those babies.''
   She said the Smith girl and the Millers were the children of
Karen Miller, 30, who was listed in serious condition at Fort
Hamilton-Hughes Hospital. There was no indication how Cooper was
related to the other victims.
   The other two injured adults were listed in fair condition with
burns, officials said.
   Hamilton, about 20 miles north of Cincinnati, is a city of about
60,000.

   Alexandrov and Soviet cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyov and Victor
Savinykh were making the second joint flight between the two
countries in nine years. On their 10-day mission to the Mir space
station, the cosmonauts took a blooming orchid grown on Earth from
seeds planted in space, the official Soviet new agency Tass reported.
   On the Mir, they will join cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa
Manarov, who have been aboard the station since Dec. 23, 1987 on a
mission that Soviet scientists say is to last more than a year.
   Tass said the joint mission is code-named ``Shipka'' after a
mountain pass in Bulgaria. It will involve about 40 experiments
involving space physics, the remote sensing of Earth, space biology
and medicine.
   The first joint Soviet-Bulgarian space mission took place in 1979
when Georgy Ivanov joined a Soviet crew. Alexandrov was Ivanov's
backup for that mission.

   A new Roman Catholic diocese of Knoxville
was established today by Pope John Paul II, who named an Irish-born
priest as the first bishop to the post.
   The Knoxville Diocese, comprised largely of rural counties, will
include the cities of Chattanooga, Johnson City and Kingsport and
will have a Catholic population of about 36,000, said Gary Honnert,
director of communications for the Memphis Diocese.
   The Vatican said the diocese was created from territory taken
from the diocese of Nashville.
   Appointed as bishop was the Rev. Anthony O'Connell, 50, a native
of Lisheen, County Clare, who immigrated to the United States 30
years ago, the Vatican said. He has been serving as rector of St.
Thomas Seminary in Hannibal, Mo.
   The Nashville Diocese, comprised of 95 counties in Tennessee, was
established in 1837, and was the state's only Roman Catholic diocese
until 1971 when Pope Paul VI established the Memphis Diocese,
Honnert said.
   There are about 130,000 Catholics in Tennessee; the Memphis
Diocese has more than 50,000 Catholics.

<HEAD>Bowling League Says Shut Out Cause Members Didn't Eat And Drink
Enough</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a 60-woman
bowling league reinstated at a country club that allegedly took away
the league's time slot because its members didn't spend enough on
food and drinks.
   But a lawyer for the Fern Hill Golf and Country Club said it was
a matter of a lack of a contract and that there wouldn't be any
lanes to spare for the Wednesday Night Ladies House League when the
order takes effect Sept. 7.
   Macomb County Circuit Judge Michael D. Schwartz issued a
preliminary injunction Monday restoring the women's time slot, said
Sharon Lutz, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``We were real pleased,'' said Carol Blossey, president of the
women's league. ``We've said all along we liked bowling at Fern Hill
and we wanted to stay there.''
   The ACLU entered the case last month after the women complained
that Fern Hill management kicked them out because they didn't spend
enough money on food and drink.
   But later, club owner Fred Severini Jr. said the women were not
invited back for their March league because they hadn't signed a
contract. ``Drinking has nothing to do with it,'' he said.
   Lutz said it was the first time in four years that Fern Hill had
required them to sign a contract. She maintained that none of the
other leagues bowling at the country club have contracts.
   Fern Hill attorney David Heyboer said he hopes to overturn the
order.
   ``We're not pleased. We're probably going to end up having a
trial this summer; at this point it's just an injunction,'' Heyboer
said. ``The place only has 12 lanes and those lanes are gone.
   ``We've been under contract with the men's league since Feb. 18.
There's going to be a lot of bowling balls coming down the alley,
I'm afraid.''

Ford Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Any Cabinet-level federal official should
resign if continuing in office harms the president or the
presidency, former President Gerald Ford said in response to a
question about Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Ford, in an appearance Monday before the National Press Club, was
asked what advice he would give Meese regarding resignation from
office. An independent counsel has been investigating
conflict-of-interest allegations regarding Meese's financial
dealings.
   ``I strongly believe that when a person in the Cabinet or in some
comparable post in the federal government, if he is challenged for
alleged misdeeds, if his staying in office in any way undercuts or
jeopardizes the president or the presidency, that individual should
walk into the Oval Office and offer his resignation,'' Ford said.
   He did not mention Meese by name, nor did he say Meese's
continuation in office undercuts or jeopardizes the president.
   Ford said in his speech that the deficit-saddled federal budget
process ``is in total shambles'' and Congress should restore power
to the White House to straighten out the mess.
   Ford called for Congress to reinstate the president's power to
impound appropriated money, a device Congress removed when it
streamlined the budget process in 1974.
   ``The anti-impoundment provisions, in my opinion, have been a
disaster,'' Ford said. The present system is ``no substitute for
strong action by the president of the United States,'' he said.
   Ford's speech came after he unveiled his portrait at the
Smithsonian Institution's Hall of the Presidents, the first
presidential portrait painted explicitly for the collection.

   A stable owner fatally shot himself with
a shotgun after inviting family and friends to a property settlement
hearing that would end his 44-year marriage.
   The courthouse in Arapahoe County, southeast of Denver, has been
the scene of several violent family breakups prompting authorities
to install metal detectors at the door.
   Deputies, who had been alerted by the wife's attorney about the
invitations, watched from atop the courthouse Monday as the stable
owner, Everett Allen, 63, drove by.
   Allen had sent the notes to people who knew him and his wife,
Gracie Maxine, so they could witness ``Gracie's moment of glory,''
said Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan.
   Deputies ringed the parking lot and entrance to the courthouse,
planning to escort Allen to the courtroom. As they watched him with
binoculars he drove to park on a dead-end street; then they lost
sight of him.
   Deputies later found him slumped in his seat, with a shotgun
wound in his chest.
   Many of the couple's relatives had shown up for the scheduled
hearing.
   ``We had our hands full trying to keep them away from each
other,'' Sullivan said.
   Bob Cooper, attorney for Mrs. Allen, said the shooting emphasized
that courthouse ``security is essential.''
   He said Mrs. Allen, who is confined to a wheelchair, ``has been
in hiding out of the state for a year and a half.''
   Cooper said he has feared for his life and that of Mrs. Allen.
   ``He sent threats to both of us through friends, relatives and in
letters,'' the attorney said.
   Allen, owner of Stable Inc. in the Aurora area, was charged with
cruelty to animals in 1974, 1979 and 1983 but was acquitted each
time.
   People entering the courthouse have been scanned by metal
detectors since January when Chanh Van Duong fatally shot his
estranged wife outside a courtroom where they were scheduled for a
child custody hearing.
   Two years earlier, Gerald Utesch, an Aurora police officer at the
time, shot his wife's divorce lawyer, crippling her.

   A Bulgarian cosmonaut rocketed into a clear blue
sky today along with two Soviets in the first manned space mission
of 1988, a launch televised live and featuring broadcasts from
inside the capsule.
   Alexander Alexandrov, 36, of the Bulgarian town of Omurtag, and
the two Soviets blasted off at 6:03 p.m. (10:03 a.m. EDT) aboard a
Soyuz TM-5 capsule from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central
Asia.
   Soviet television gave unusually extensive coverage of the
liftoff, showing live pictures of Alexandrov's family in Omurtag and
black-and-white shots of the cosmonauts in the moments before and
after launch.
   ``I feel excellent,'' Alexandrov said on the live broadcast
seconds after the launch.
   The broadcast, which lasted more than an hour, showed
Alexandrov's mother and other members of his family watching the
launch on television in Bulgaria. Bulgaria's defense minister was
among the dignitaries viewing the liftoff at the Baikonur Cosmodrome
in the republic of Kazakhstan. The broadcast showed cheering, waving
crowds gathered on Bulgarian streets.
   Only a few clouds were visible in television shots of Baikonur.
Orange flames coming from the Vostok booster rocket contrasted with
the blue sky in the background.
   The mission comes while the American manned space program is
grounded. The last launch, in January 1986, ended in disaster. Seven
astronauts were killed when the space shuttle Challenger exploded.
   Alexandrov and cosmonauts Viktor P. Savinykh and Anatoly Y.
Solovyov are scheduled to dock Thursday with the Soviet space
station Mir. Already aboard Mir are cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and
Musa Manarov, who were the last men to enter space. They boarded Mir
on Dec. 23, 1987.
   During a 10-day mission, Alexandrov and his four Soviet
colleagues are to conduct about 40 experiments, some using Bulgarian
equipment. The expermiments involve space physics, remote sensing of
Earth, space biology and medicine, the news agency Tass has said.
   The cosmonauts are taking with them an orchid grown on Earth from
seeds originally planted on the Mir station, Tass said.
   The last Bulgarian-Soviet flight, in April 1979, was marred by a
failed attempt to dock with the Salyut space station.
   The Soviets plan several other manned missions this year,
including crews from France and Afghanistan.

   A truck towing two tankers
of gasoline overturned and exploded early today, pouring flames
across coast-hugging U.S. 101 and spilling fuel down a canyon to the
beach, officials said.
   There were no structures in the fire's path and campers about 200
yards away were not evacuated, officials said.
   The driver of the tanker-truck, carrying up to about 8,800
gallons of gasoline, may have fallen asleep at the wheel before the
accident in the northbound lanes about 20 miles up the coast from
Santa Barbara, said Santa Barbara County Fire spokesman Keith Cullom.
   The driver suffered severe burns over 100 percent of his body and
was in critical condition at the Sherman Oaks Burn Center in Los
Angeles, Cullom said.
   ``He was apparently pinned underneath the truck by a door prior
to the explosion. He freed himself and was burned while running from
the wreckage,'' he said.
   Both sides of the freeway became engulfed in flames and were
closed for several hours, said California Highway Patrol dispatcher
Ed Clark.
   Gasoline entered a drainage culvert under the freeway and flowed
to the ocean, Cullom said.
   ``It burned about five acres of brush before reaching the
ocean,'' he said. ``We don't know yet how much fuel flowed into the
ocean.''
   The driver was identified only as a 42-year-old man from Acton.

   Underground leaders of the 6-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories today
called on Arab leaders to open their borders to guerrilla attacks on
Israel.
   The appeal, carried by the Palestinian news agency Wafa, was made
to the Arab chiefs of state who begin a three-day emergency summit
meeting in Algiers tonight.
   The summit was to be devoted to solidifying support for the
Palestinian uprising among the 21 Arab League members.
   The underground leaders of the uprising _ which involves mainly
Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza _ said all
the Arab nations surrounding Israel should ``open their borders to
Palestinian combatants.''
   The appeal was directed mainly at Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, the
three nations represented at the summit that have a common border
with Israel. All three, fearing Israeli reprisals, have taken action
to prevent guerrilla attacks on Israel across their borders.
   Algeria prepared a spectacular welcome for King Hassan II of
Morocco, who arrived on a luxury liner in the Bay of Algiers. His
visit marks the two North African Arab neighbors' reconciliation
after 12 years of hostility.
   Algeria and Morocco resumed diplomatic relations May 16 after
deciding to put aside their dispute over the Western Sahara, at
least for now.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi arrived this afternoon, escorted by
female bodyguards and wearing a gold-embroidered white kaftan. A
black-and-white Palestinian khafia in the colors of the Palestine
Liberation Organization was draped around his neck.
   In a statement distributed by Libya's official news agency JANA
on the eve of the summit, Gadhafi accused unidentified Arab leaders
of ``acting under specific instructions from the U.S. State
Department.''
   ``The possibility of denouncing these leaders before the
Palestinian people and the Arab nation will perhaps be the only
positive point of this summit,'' Gadhafi declared.
   President Hafez Assad of Syria and President Amin Gemayel of
Lebanon were among the last to arrive. PLO chairman Yasser Arafat,
King Hussein of Jordan and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia flew in Monday.
   The underground leaders ``exhorted the Arab chiefs of state to
allow Palestinians living in the Arab countries to take part in the
struggle against the Zionist enemy,'' Wafa said.
   The uprising's leadership also demanded joint Arab action to give
``international protection'' to the Palestinian people and to
demolish all ``suspect peace plans,'' such as that of Secretary of
State George P. Shultz. Today, he ended a four-day tour of the
region to promote the plan.
   An international peace conference with full representation of the
PLO remains the only way to ``a durable, just and global peace,''
the underground leaders declared.
   The United States and Israel officially regard the PLO as a
terrorist organization and seek to bar it from any role in the peace
process.
   PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said Monday in Algiers that the
Shultz plan was ``born dead.''
   He said the PLO was not only demanding money to compensate for
loss of income due to protest strikes in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, but other forms of support such as food shipments.
   He said political support for the rioting should include a
unified stand by the conferees, rejecting the latest U.S. peace
initiative and reiterating ``their endorsement of the PLO as the
sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, inside
and outside the occupied terroritories.''
   Arab League officials and diplomats said the summit will also
touch on other key problems facing the Arab world, such as the
Iran-Iraq war and the conflict in Lebanon.

<HEAD>Georgia Governor Approves Capitol Rally For White Supremacists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia's governor, conceding white supremacists
have a right to rally, has granted the request of the Nationalist
Movement to gather on the state Capitol grounds the day before the
Democratic National Convention.
   ``There is no legal impediment to keep them from using the
Capitol grounds for their purposes,'' said Barbara Morgan, press
secretary to Gov. Joe Frank Harris. She said a letter to the group
was prepared Monday.
   The Nationalist Movement is based in Jackson, Miss., and is
afflilated with the Forsyth County Defense League, an organization
formed in the wake of civil rights activity in the county just north
of Atlanta.
   The city of Atlanta last month granted the Nationalist Movement a
parade permit to allow the group to parade from the Capitol to a
free-speech site near The Omni, where the Democratic convention will
be held July 18-21.
   Richard Barrett, a lawyer who heads the defense league, said he
expects 1,000 marchers. He said the group would be protected by its
own, unarmed security force _ youths in camouflage uniforms.

<HEAD>Vatican Panel Approves Miracle Attributed to Mother Drexel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vatican commission today approved a miracle
attributed to the intercession of Mother Katharine Drexel, clearing
the way for her beatification by Pope John Paul II, a churchman said.
   The Rev. Paul Molinari, the ``postulator'' or presenter of
Mother's Drexel's cause, said the miracle was approved unanimously
by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.
   ``The next step is for the pope to make the decision final and
set a date for the beatification, possibly in the fall,'' he said in
a telephone interview.
   Beatification is a step toward possible sainthood, which would
require confirmation of a second miracle attributed to her
intercession.
   Mother Drexel, a member of a prominent Philadelphia banking
family, founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament in 1891 to work
among blacks and American Indians. She lived on less than a dollar a
day, but gave an estimated $20 million to further her order's work
before her death in 1955 at age 96.
   The miracle attributed to her involved the healing in 1974 of
Robert J. Gutherman, who had lost hearing in his right ear from an
infection. He regained his hearing after his family and members of
the order prayed for Mother Drexel's intervention.

<HEAD>Patrick Kennedy Sizes Up State Legislature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Kennedy, the 20-year-old son of
U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, says he may run for the Legislature
against a five-term incumbent.
   The Providence College student said he has commissioned a
political pool to assess the strength of Rep. John Skeffington Jr.,
D-Providence, a funeral director who has longtime family ties in the
ethnic, blue-collar district.
   ``I'm taking it seriously, one step at a time,'' said Kennedy,
who added that he will make a final decision whether to file for the
Sept. 14 primary within three weeks.
   The 50-year-old Skeffington had a difficult primary in 1986 and
won renomination by only 185 votes over a 22-year-old political
newcomer.
   The 9th District is strongly Democratic; for decades, winning the
Democratic primary has virtually assured winning the seat.
   ``I think you've got to wait your turn,'' said Skeffington.
``Sure I wanted to run when I was 20, but I talked it over with
(former Providence Mayor) Joe Doorley and he told me I had to pay my
dues.''
   ``I can't believe the Kennedys are going to try to knock out a
true Democrat,'' he said.
   Kennedy served as a page at the Statehouse last year and was a
researcher for the Legislative Council, the research arm of the
General Assembly.
   President of the Providence College Young Democrats, Kennedy said
he was encouraged by his showing when he was elected as a national
convention delegate in the March primary. He is pledged to
Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   Kennedy spent $12,000 and finished second among all the delegate
candidates pledged to the Massachusetts governor. Only Providence
Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr., drew more votes.
   ``The response from people in Rhode Island was very positive,''
Kennedy said.
   Kennedy said his father has encouraged his son's political career.
   ``He is happy that I enjoy politics,'' the young Kennedy said.

   A space shuttle crew made a mock
emergency landing today to conclude a major countdown rehearsal held
to test hundreds of launch changes that were made as a result of the
Challenger disaster.
   Following a successful practice countdown and liftoff, the
three-man astronaut crew, in a shuttle flight simulator in Houston,
had to make a tricky, quick return to the Kennedy Space Center
runway here when one of three main engines failed more than two
minutes into the flight.
   The rehearsal for the nation's first shuttle mission in 2{ years
put the launch team here through the final three hours of the count
in a realistic preparation for the actual launch of Discovery,
scheduled Aug. 31. It was the most comprehensive test of its kind
since Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch, killing the seven
crew members, on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The make-believe emergency landing gave the astronauts and
mission control center in Houston vital experience in making
split-second decisions. To make it safely back to the runway here,
the astronauts had to ``fly'' the simulator to an altitude of about
75 miles and about 400 miles east of here while fuel was exhausted.
   Then, with a second engine locked up and useless, the astronauts
pitched around, went through the motions of jettisoning their huge
external fuel tank into the Atlantic Ocean and, battling hydraulic
and other difficulties, glided to a mock touchdown on the
15,000-foot shuttle runway three miles from the launch pad. Landing
occurred 21 minutes after the engine failed.
   Executing the maneuvers in the simulator were astronauts Loren
Shriver, James Wetherbee and Franklin Chang-Diaz. Observing were
commander Rick Hauck and the four members of his crew who will fly
the Discovery mission in August.
   The simulated liftoff was 55 minutes late because of intentional
electrical, communications and other problems built into the count
to give controllers experience in resolving them. A high fuel
pressure reading 31 seconds before liftoff would have scrubbed a
real launch effort, but was bypassed so the test could continue.
   The exercise involved 300 launch-day team members from five NASA
field centers, contractor personnel and rescue, weather, safety and
communications officials. NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said the
purpose was to ``validate to the fullest extent possible the
complete launch process system.''
   There have been hundreds of changes, most aimed at safety, in
procedures, personnel, flight and ground hardware, software and
management since the Challenger accident. Today's simulation was the
only opportunity to check them out with the entire launch-day team
before the actual countdown.
   Under the new management structure, astronaut Bob Crippen,
veteran of four shuttle flights, has the final decision on whether a
shuttle will be launched. His main adviser is launch director Bob
Sieck, but either can call on scores of experts in many disciplines.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the Challenger
disaster, with the major roadblock to flight being the redesign of
the solid fuel booster rocket blamed for the explosion.
   Discovery is in a hangar here, undergoing final checks following
an overhaul of its main engine and other systems. On June 16, it is
to be moved into an assembly building for mating with its two
booster rockets and external fuel tank. Transfer to the launch pad
is planned for June 27.
   The spaceship's three main engines will be test-fired on the pad
in a critical test on July 19.
   Space agency officials said the Aug. 31 launch target can be met
if no critical problems crop up during testing here and at the
Morton Thiokol plant in Utah, where two more full-scale tests are
planned of the redesigned booster rocket. The Utah tests are slated
for June 14 and July 26.
   When Discovery is launched it will carry a crew of five veteran
shuttle astronauts who will deploy a tracking and data relay
satellite and conduct experiments during four days in space.

   Primary voters today narrow the fields in four U.S. Senate races,
choose nominees for governor of Montana and pick a black Democratic
candidate for the New Jersey congressional seat occupied by Peter
Rodino for 40 years.
   In other highlights of voting in seven states, Californians
decide a large crop of propositions, including a measure sponsored
by supporters of extremist Lyndon LaRouche that would permit the
state to quarantine AIDS victims. Sacramento voters could become the
first in the nation to close a nuclear power plant, the troubled
Rancho Seco; and voters in San Bernardino County _ the nation's
largest _ will decide whether to carve away the eastern, desert
portion to create a new county called Mojave.
   In San Diego, the nation's seventh-largest city, Mayor Maureen
O'Connor is expected to win a four-year term by gaining a majority
in the nonpartisan primary. She was first elected two years ago
after Mayor Roger Hedgecock was convicted of a felony and forced to
resign.
   Both of the nation's first-term Democrats are among the senators
with a stake in today's races, and both have been targeted as
vulnerable by the national GOP. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey has
two little-known primary opponents, and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico
has none.
   New Jersey Republicans have united behind a single nominee, Peter
Dawkins, a former Heisman trophy winner, Rhodes scholar and Vietnam
war hero who moved to the state to enter the race.
   Voting officials in New Jersey reported a light turnout this
morning for the primary races.
   In New Mexico, four Republicans are competing for the chance to
face Bingaman. A poll taken last week for the Albuquerque Journal
showed state Sen. Bill Valentine leading the field with support of
29.5 percent of Republicans, but 38.9 percent were undecided.
   A third first-term senator seeking re-election is Republican Pete
Wilson of California. He has no primary competition, but does have a
jinx to worry about _ for 30 years, no one holding his Senate seat
has been elected more than once. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov.
Leo McCarthy is expected to dispatch three little-known opponents.
   Montana also has a Senate race, with two-term Democrat John
Melcher opposed in the primary by attorney Robert Kelleher, who
advocates a parliamentary form of government. Yellowstone County
Commissioner Conrad Burns is the only GOP entrant.
   But the liveliest race in Montana is for governor, since Democrat
Ted Schwinden's decision to retire after two terms has left the
ballot without an incumbent for the first time in 20 years.
   The six-way Democratic field features a comeback bid by former
Gov. Thomas Judge, who served two terms before losing to Schwinden
in the primary eight years ago. A Montana Poll taken last week
showed Judge was the choice of 28 percent of Democratic voters, but
35 percent were undecided.
   In the two-way Republican race, the poll showed a dead heat
between former state Sen. Stan Stephens and state Rep. Cal Winslow.
The GOP favorite, Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, was killed in a
plane crash in April.
   The retirement of Rodino, whose 79th birthday is today, comes
amid growing sentiment that his predominantly black district should
be represented by the state's first black congressman. Two black
Newark city councilmen, Donald Payne and Ralph Grant, are competing
in the Democratic primary, with the winner expected to defeat the
GOP nominee, political newcomer Michael Webb, who also is black.
   Here is a look at the other states voting today:
   ALABAMA _ Democratic Reps. Claude Harris of Tuscaloosa and Bill
Nichols of Sylacauga are favored to turn back primary challenges.
   Races for three Supreme Court seats have turned into unusually
rough-and-tumble scraps in which big business and insurance
companies are backing one slate of Democrats, while trial lawyers
and less conservative interests are backing another. One of the
candidates with trial lawyer support is Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy
of Montgomery, a son-in-law of former Gov. George C. Wallace. He is
running against Anniston lawyer A.W. Bolt, who is supported by
business lobbies, for an associate justice post.
   IOWA _ Sixteen LaRouche supporters are running in Democratic
primaries, five for congressional nominations and the rest in state
legislative districts. Four Democrats are seeking the nomination to
oppose first-term GOP Rep. Fred Grandy, who for years played Gopher
on television's ``The Love Boat.''
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ The state is having one of its quietest elections
in memory, with no statewide races on the ballot. And there are only
26 primary races for the 105 state Senate and House seats. The
state's lone congressman, Democratic Rep. Tim Johnson, is unopposed
in the primary as is his Republican challenger, state Treasurer
David Volk.

   A U.S.-Soviet commission verifying compliance with
the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty signed by the two
superpowers is meeting in Geneva today for the first time.
   Under the treaty, signed in December by President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the United States and the Soviet
Union must eliminate all missiles with ranges between 300 miles and
3,400 miles.
   The Special Verification Commission is to discuss any problems
that may arise in verifying the elimination of an entire class of
missiles.
   The treaty says that within 30 days ``after entry into force,''
each party must provide the other side with updated data on the
number and location of its missiles. The treaty entered into force
June 1, when Reagan and Gorbachev exchanged the documents of
ratification at their Moscow summit.
   The treaty also says that either side can request a meeting of
the commission to resolve questions relating to compliance with the
accord or to ``agree on such measures as may be necessary to improve
the viability and effectiveness'' of the treaty.
   The U.S. side is headed by Steven Steiner, of the National
Security Council, and the Soviet side by Mikhail Streltsov, who was
a member of the INF treaty negotiating team.
   U.S. officials said they anticipated that the session would last
about two weeks.

   A Latin American effort to negotiate a
settlement to the political crisis in Panama got off to an
unpromising start last week when military leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega showed no inclination to surrender power, according a senior
administration official.
   The official, insisting on anonymity, said Noriega showed ``an
unwillngness to compromise and no give'' in his meeting with former
presidents Caros Andres Perez of Venezuela and Daniel Oduber of
Costa Rica.
   The meeting was held a week after a U.S. negotiating effort
collapsed when Noriega unexpectedly rejected a package deal at the
last minute that would have required him to resign his post as
Defense Force commander in August and temporarily leave the country.
   In an interview Monday, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams said Perez, who is seeking another term as Venezuelan
president in elections in December, is expected to report on his
Panama initiative to Secretary of State George P. Shultz later this
month. Abrams refused comment on Noriega's meeting with the two
presidents.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked today if the United
States planned to lift its economic sanctions against Panama, said,
``There has been no change in our policy. We are proceeding on the
same course and don't anticipate any change at this point.''
   Meanwhile, two State Department envoys were dispatched to Panama
last week to assess the situation, but no meetings were held with
Noriega or other government officials.
   Abrams said Morton Abramowitz, head of the Bureau of Intelligence
and Research, explored the possibility of new U.S. options for
dealing with Panama in the wake of the failed negotiating effort.
   Paul Taylor, a deputy assistant secretary who accompanied
Abramowitz, examined the U.S. sanctions against Panama and concluded
that ``the economic pressures on Panama are very great,'' Abrams
said.
   Among other measures, the administration has frozen Panamanian
assets in the United States and is withholding payments to Panama
for services related to the operation of the Panama Canal.
   A separate Latin American initiative on Panama involves an offer
by Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo for his country to be used as
a site for negotiations between Noriega and his political opponents.
   Abrams appeared to hold out little hope that any Latin American
negotiation could reach a settlement that would meet the U.S. goal
of restoring democracy in Panama.
   Abrams noted that the deal U.S. negotiators had worked out was
opposed by an overwhelming majority in the Senate and by Vice
President George Bush. The objections were based largely on the
administration offer to drop federal drug smuggling indictments
against Noriega as part of the package deal.
   Abrams expressed doubt that the Latin negotiators would be able
get a better deal than the one Noriega rejected because they lack
leverage.
   ``The Latins don't have as much clout as we do because they can't
play with the indictments or the sanctions,'' Abrams said. ``How are
they going to get a better deal? If they get a worse deal, how is
that going to be acceptable to the American people?
   ``So the Latin role is both promising and potentially quite
difficult.''

   While environmentalists waited for a judge to
consider their request to stop the Navy from generating intense
electromagnetic pulses off the Atlantic coast, the Pentagon
announced today that the tests had begun.
   The tests, according to the Navy, are intended to measure the
ability of naval equipment to withstand radiation following a
nuclear blast.
   The Pentagon said the Empress II barge had reached the test site
off the Virginia-North Carolina coast Monday afternoon and began the
monthlong experiment by transmitting three micro-second bursts of
electrical energy at around 4 p.m.
   ``At about 8 a.m. this morning the generator began the second day
of tests,'' said Lt. Karen Kent, a Navy spokeswoman in Washington.
The tests, she said, were being monitored by sophisticated measuring
devices onshore, 15 miles away.
   ``The effect of the transmissions at those sites would be the
same as sitting inside a car and transmitting on a CB radio for one
second,'' she said.
   The Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington-based
environmental group, asked the U.S. Appeals Court for the District
of Columbia on Monday to halt the project.
   ``Right now our attorneys are at the courthouse trying to get the
judge to set a time for a hearing on our request for an injunction
while we appeal the last court ruling,'' said Jeremy Rifkin,
director of the foundation.
   The barge Empress II is designed to simulate the electromagnetic
radiation that would follow the detonation of a nuclear weapon
outside the Earth's atmosphere. The tests are intended to determine
the ability of Navy ships, aircraft and weapons to withstand the
pulses.
   Empress II, or Electromagnetic Pulse Radiation Environment
Simulator for Ships, Second Generation, can generate pulses of up to
7 million volts.
   Environmentalists have expressed concern the surges will disrupt
the marine environment within the test area, and might affect
computers and other delicate equipment outside it.
   ``We just do not believe the Navy has taken a hard look at these
possible consequences at this particular site,'' said Andrew
Kimbrell, an attorney for the foundation.
   The foundation filed a lawsuit in 1987 and reached agreement with
the Navy last month that an environmental impact statement was
needed before testing could begin.
   The foundation's interpretation of the agreement was that the
Navy would submit an environmental impact statement on the site it
chose for testing, which could take up to two years.
   The Navy's interpretation was that it would submit an impact
statement, but that the study would not necessarily involve a
specific site. The Navy submitted a statement previously drawn up
for a Chesapeake Bay site.
   A federal judge ruled Friday that the Navy's interpretation was
plausible, and allowed the tests to proceed. Several calls today to
the Pentagon seeking to find out the time for the tests were not
returned.
   The Navy insists that no dangers to the environment have been
found in 20 years of similar testing and exhaustive studies.

   Australian adventurer Mick Dundee left his
competitors down under as ```Crocodile' Dundee II'' bit off 50
percent more of the weekend box-office gross than its nearest rival,
the Tom Hanks comedy ``Big.''
   Sylvester Stallone's blood-and-blast-filled ``Rambo III'' slipped
to third place, while the Chevy Chase comedy ``Funny Farm''
cultivated enough money to harvest the No. 4 spot, plowing the
George Lucas-produced, Ron Howard-directed fantasy ``Willow'' into
fifth place.
   ```Crocodile' Dundee II,'' the comedy sequel starring Australia's
Paul Hogan, hunted up $12.72 million, compared with $8.22 million
for ``Big,'' in which Hanks portrays a boy who gets his wish to
become a grownup.
   ``Rambo III,'' in which Stallone's John Rambo shoots, bombs,
stabs and otherwise maims numerous Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan,
ranked third, grossing $7.69 million for the weekend.
   Chase's portrayal of a sportswriter seeking country-style
relaxation in ``Funny Farm'' reaped nearly $5.66 million.
   The medieval fatnasy ``Willow,'' which cost $35 million to
produce plus $20 million to make prints and for advertising, drooped
two place to fifth, grossing just over $5 million for the weekend.
   ``That's not bad,'' insisted John Krier, president of Exhibitor
Relations Co., which compiles the box office takes. ``It shows
possibilities of holding well.''
   After the top five films, weekend grosses dropped sharply.
   ``Colors,'' the Sean Penn-Robert Duvall, cops-versus-street gangs
drama, brought in $1.45 million, while Michael Keaton's ghostly
comedy ``Beetlejuice,'' scared up $1.42 million.
   ``Friday the 13th Part VII'' slashed another $900,156 out of
filmgoers' wallets.
   Oscar-winning ``Moonstruck'' and the Robin Williams' comedy
``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' showed staying power, grossing $612,475
and $540,891, respectively, after more than two dozen weeks in
release.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in release

   The son of retiring Rep. Delbert Latta has
conceded defeat in a close Republican primary race for the
congressional seat the elder Latta has held since 1958.
   Robert Latta said in an interview Monday that he will not pursue
his right to have the validity of a number of ballots from the May 3
primary decided by the Ohio Supreme Court, leaving state Senate
President Paul Gillmor the GOP nominee by just 27 votes.
   ``This decision will mean that the Republican nominee for
Congress from the 5th District will have been nominated by a margin
of 27 votes, the narrowest margin ever recorded in an Ohio
congressional race. Notwithstanding the narrow margin, I
congratulate the winner,'' said Latta, 32, a Bowling Green attorney.
   An official recount of the May 3 primary ballots in the 13-county
northwest Ohio district gave Gillmor 28,694 votes to 28,667 for
Latta. A third candidate, Rex Damschroder of Fremont, received 5,769
votes.
   The closest election suffered by the elder Latta, a member of the
House budget and rules committees, was 55 percent in 1982. He
rebounded to 63 percent in 1984 and did as well in 1986.
   The congressman's son said Friday there was some concern over
several disputed ballots. On Monday, he declined to disclose how
many ballots were in question.
   But one Republican official, who spoke on the condition his name
not be used, said there were fewer than 27 disputed ballots and
suggested that might have been a factor in Latta's decision against
a legal challenge.
   Gillmor, 49, of Port Clinton, said Monday he was glad the primary
was finally over.
   ``This has been the longest election night I have ever been in.
It was an election night that lasted 30 days,'' he joked.

<HEAD>Greece Seizes Terror Suspect, But Delays Extradition</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 4th graf, A report with 3 new grafs, bgng: In Athens xxx

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is pressing reluctant Greek
officials to permit extradition of a Palestinian suspected of
involvement in the bombings of a Pan Am jumbo jet in 1982 and of a
TWA airliner in 1986, U.S. officials say.
   Greek officials told the United States they did not think the
evidence against Mohammed Rashid was sufficient and asked for
additional information to justify extradition proceedings, a U.S.
official said Monday, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   He said Rashid was arrested in Greece at the request of the
United States.
   In Athens today, government spokesman Telemachos Hitiris refused
to comment directly, saying only: ``Greece always cooperates for the
eradication of terrorism and is dedicated to the struggle against
it. It imposes the strictest possible penalties against terrorists
according to Greek law.''
   A report about Rashid's arrest and U.S. annoyance over Greece's
hesitancy to extradite him appeared Monday in Eleftherotypia, a
left-wing Greek daily newspaper. The paper said Rashid was seized
Thursday at Athens airport on a tip from an official in the U.S.
embassy.
   ``A police source said yesterday (Sunday) that there are no
charges against Rashid, except maybe the use of a forged passport,''
Eleftherotypia wrote.
   U.S. intelligence information on Rashid indicates he was involved
in a 1986 blast aboard a Trans World Airlines airliner over Greece,
in which four people, including a baby, were killed, the U.S.
official said.
   Rashid also is suspected of playing a role in planting the bomb
that exploded as a Pan American Airways jet was heading toward
Honolulu in August 1982 on a flight from Tokyo. A Japanese teen-ager
was killed and 15 people were injured, none seriously.
   A second source told the Associated Press Greece has not yet made
a decision on the extradition request.
   The first official said Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, the State
Department's top anti-terrorism official, flew to Athens last week
to press the Greek government to permit the extradition of Rashid to
the United States.
   Robert Keeley, the U.S. Ambassador to Greece, also asked for
Rashid's extradition during a meeting last Thursday with Greek
Premier Andreas Papandreou, said a third source, also speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The extradition request comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-Greek
relations. The two countries are negotiating the extension of the
leases on four American bases in Greece. The leases expire Dec. 31.
   Papandreou, under pressure from leftist groups, is seeking to
negotiate favorable terms for extending the leases, including an
increase in U.S. aid.
   The Socialist leader is also on good terms with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, and earlier this year he met in Athens with
PLO chief Yasser Arafat. Greek newspapers reported at the time that
Arafat had promised Papandreou to refrain from terror attacks on
Greek soil.
   U.S. officials have in the past accused Greece of being lax on
terrorism. Relations with Athens were strained in 1984, after Greece
freed a suspected Jordanian hijacker who reportedly was arrested on
the basis of U.S. intelligence information.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, winding
up a futile Middle East peace mission, said today that extremism and
an arms buildup could engulf the region unless Arabs and Israelis
shed their illusions.
   He said the United States would not slow its efforts to prod the
two sides into negotiations, adding that he would like to have
another try at Mideast diplomacy before the Reagan administration
ends in January.
   ``The underlying problem won't go away by itself and can't be
wished away,'' Shultz told a news conference. ``Nor can it be
ignored. The lives and well-being of too many people are endangered
by the continuation of this conflict.''
   During five days in the region, he met with leaders of Israel,
Jordan, Egypt and Syria and found support for his plan for two-stage
negotiations only from President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, whose
nation is at peace with Israel.
   At the White House today, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
President Reagan wants Shultz to persevere in his peace-making
efforts.

<HEAD>Hospital Chief: County President Knew About Experiments In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug experiments on more than 200 pregnant women
were known to the president of the Cook County Board, but he did not
tell other commissioners, according to the director of the county
hospital.
   Two doctors gave Dilantin, a drug commonly used to treat
epilepsy, to about 245 pregnant women to determine whether the drug
reduced fetal stress during Caesarean-section births, hospital
Director Terrence Hansen said.
   But only five of the women had consented to participate in the
hospital-approved study that began in September 1987, he said.
   Hansen and other hospital officials met with the board, which
acts as trustees for the hospital, behind closed doors for nearly
two hours Monday to discuss the case against the two
anesthesiologists.
   Several board members said they were angry and shocked when they
heard the disclosure. The board's president, George Dunne, said he
didn't recall being told.
   He said the board would take no immediate action and would wait
for the hospital medical staff's executive committee to finish its
investigation, a process required under medical staff bylaws.
   Hansen said Dunne was told about the experiments in January when
hospital medical director Dr. Agnes Lattimer ordered a halt to the
study.
   ``We told President Dunne and he advised us to follow due process
according to the hospital's bylaws,'' Hansen said.
   Dunne said, ``I don't recall that conversation.''
   Commissioner Samuel Vaughan, head of the Health and Hospitals
Committee which oversees County, Oak Forest and Cermak hospitals,
said, ``Doctors should know that you don't conduct experiments on
patients without getting their consent.''
   Hansen said the doctors' study called for giving the drug to no
more than 50 pregnant patients who were candidates for
Caesarean-section deliveries.
   ``The great majority'' of the 245 patients given the drug were
pregnant, Hansen said, adding that he knew ``at least one patient''
who was not.
   He said he was not sure why non-pregnant women would have been
given Dilantin.
   Several past studies have reported higher incidences of birth
defects, including heart abnormalities and retardation, in babies
born to women who regularly used Dilantin and other drugs used to
combat epileptic seizures.
   Hansen has noted, however, that the women at Cook County Hospital
were given a single dose of between 500 and 700 milligrams _
``substantially lower'' than a normal dose _ at or near the time
they delivered.
   Ms. Lattimer said she was convinced the pregnant women who had
been given the drug without their consent suffered ``no adverse
effects.''
   ``That does not mean it is not a serious infraction and should
not be prevented from happening again,'' she said. ``The physicians
involved in this study violated hospital regulations.''

<HEAD>U.S., Britain and West Germans In Contact With Iran Over Hostages,
Paper Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to update with White House comment. Picks

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, Britain and West Germany have
initiated direct contacts with the Iranians in an effort to free
foreign hostages in Lebanon, The Times of London reported today.
   In a front-page story, the conservative daily quoted Shiite and
Sunni Moslem sources in Beirut as saying the United States opened
talks with Iranian officials almost two months ago in the hope of
finding a ``legal'' formula to secure the release of the American
hostages.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
he was not aware of any such contacts and said he had not seen the
Times story.
   ``As you know, we're always talking to people at various levels
about the hostage situation,'' he said. ``These stories come up
frequently and usually aren't correct, and I don't think this one is
either.''
   Asked if President Reagan would be bothered by having his term
end without the liberation of the American hostages in Lebanon,
Fitzwater said, ``Well, he'll be very disappointed, of course. The
hostage situation has been one of enormous concern and frustration
to the president.''
   Times correspondent Robert Fisk, writing from west Beirut, said
separate contacts by the three countries with the Iranians are all
reported to have taken place in Europe.
   ``So widely are the reports now believed in Beirut that the
American Embassy here has been approached by several organizations
representing kidnapped Lebanese in the hope that Washington might
include other hostages in its bargaining with Tehran,'' Fisk said.
   Eighteen foreigners are missing in Lebanon including nine
Americans, three Britons and one West German. Terry Anderson, 40,
the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985, is the longest-held hostage.
   The Shiite and Sunni sources were quoted as saying that ``legal''
methods of freeing the hostages would involve the paying of
compensation to Iran and the release of Iranian assets which were
frozen after the 1979 revolution that overthrew Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi.
   Iran has repeatedly demanded that the United States deliver large
quantities of American weapons and armor paid for by the shah, the
paper said.
   ``What has emerged only too clearly in west Beirut is that Iran
controls all the foreign hostages still alive here and that even
incidents like the Kuwait Airlines hijacking ultimately have their
roots in Tehran,'' Fisk said.
   ``This is why the increasing reports here of contacts between
London, Washington, Bonn and Tehran are met with so little
incredulity,'' he said.
   Fisk reported new details on several hostage-takings.
   For example, he said, Terry Waite, the Archbishop of Canterbury's
special envoy, is now believed to have been detained in January 1987
by relatives of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who was arrested in West
Germany four days earlier and is a suspect in the 1985 hijacking of
a TWA jet. Waite went to Beirut to meet with the kidnappers of
Anderson and another American.
   Fisk quoted sources close to the Shiite Moslem Amal militia as
saying Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, the American officer who
commanded a United Nations observer group and was kidnapped in south
Lebanon in February, was targeted for abduction by the Iranian
Embassy in Beirut.

<HEAD>Chinese Premiere of `Last Emperor' Delayed Two Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese premiere of the Academy Award-winning
movie ``The Last Emperor,'' which was to have opened this month,
will be delayed until August, an official said Tuesday.
   The spokesman for the Film Bureau, which must approve all foreign
films shown in China, said Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci's
epic was still being dubbed into Chinese.
   Reports in April said the film would open in a matter of weeks.
   There has been speculation that the Chinese release of the film,
which captured nine Oscars, including best picture and best
director, had run into conservative opposition and would be censored
by Chinese officials.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied that.
   The movie was cut by censors in Thailand, Japan and Taiwan.
   Criticisms of ``The Last Emperor'' have appeared in the official
press, including charges that it had ``taken too many liberties with
historical facts and leaned too much toward vulgarity in order to
please moviegoers.''
   The movie depicts the life of the last Chinese ruler, Pu Yi, from
child emperor, to puppet ruler under the Japanese, to prisoner of
the Communists and finally a gardener in China.
   During the annual session of China's legislature in April,
delegates charged that favoritism was shown toward the foreign movie
crew, which was allowed to shoot interior scenes in the Imperial
Palace in violation of Chinese law.

<HEAD>Claims She Was Deprived Of Security After Tito's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of the late president,
Josip Broz Tito, claims the government has taken away her rights and
security since her husband's death eight years ago, a newspaper said
Tuesday.
   Jovanka Broz was involved in a dispute with the government over
her inheritance and has lived in virtual seclusion since Tito,
Yugoslavia's leader for 35 years, died on May 4, 1980.
   The state-run Danas weekly quoted Mrs. Broz as saying that she
was evicted from Tito's palatial residence in an exclusive Belgrade
suburb on June 30, 1980, and was allowed to take along only the most
essential personal effects.
   ``Jovanka Broz claims that, eight years after Tito's death, she
lives deprived of her ... existential security and elementary human
rights,'' the report said.
   One night, she was removed from the residence she shared with
Tito and was taken out through a side door, taking only three little
dogs with her, the report said.
   Mrs. Broz filed suit in 1985 to gain some of Tito's estate,
mostly paintings, furs, jewelry and furniture. The government
quashed the move in December 1986 by ruling the goods were state
property.
   The government has built a new house for her in the vicinity of
her former residence, but Mrs. Broz has refused to move in until the
authorities settle her financial status and inheritance.

   A Hungarian pilot who landed his glider
in Romania after straying into Romanian airspace was returned to
Hungary, the official MTI news agency reported Tuesday.
   Ferenc Steinbinder landed his glider about 7.5 miles inside
Romanian territory near the town of Salonta on Saturday. MTI said he
made a navigational error.
   It said Steinbinder belongs to an aviation club of the Hungarian
army, but it didn't say if he was in the army.
   ``Following the usual legal formalities, the Romanian authorities
presented the glider and its pilot to the Hungarian authorities
Monday night,'' MTI said.

   Fierce fighting broke out at a Seoul
university Tuesday when masked students attacked riot police with
rocks and firebombs and shouted anti-government and anti-U.S.
slogans.
   Student leaders at other universities organized peaceful rallies
and vowed to march to the border with North Korea in an attempt to
force reunification of the North and South.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and ``Yankee go home!''
students at Soongshil University yelled as they dashed out to hurl
firebombs that exploded in flames around police in front of the
school.
   The violence erupted during mourning for a student from the
university who died Monday after setting himself afire during an
anti-government protest.
   Police fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas but were forced back
several times by groups of protesters who barricaded a road with two
basketball backboards and wielded clubs under cover of firebombs and
rocks flying from the rooftop of a school building.
   The fighting involved about 1,000 students and continued for
several hours, often carrying into nearby alleys, as students chased
squadrons of police huddling behind shields.
   Both students and policemen were seen being hit by rocks and
other missiles, but police had no overall injury figures.
   The front of the campus was draped in black mourning banners as
students inside the school stood watch over the coffin of Park
Rae-chun. Park was the third student to commit suicide in a month.
   Violent clashes erupted at several provincial campuses, but
students held peaceful rallies at many other schools across the
country to prepare for a planned march Friday to the border truce
village of Panmunjom.
   Despite repeated government warnings, radical student leaders vow
to go ahead with their march to the border to force unification of
the peninsula, divided in 1945 into Communist North Korea and
pro-Western South Korea.
   ``Drive out Yankees who forced the partition of our land!'' a
speaker shouted at a campus rally.
   Police vowed to arrest all students marching to the heavily
militarized border. Opposition parties also opposed the march,
urging students to leave contacts with the North to official
channels.
   The protesters contend that the presence of 42,000 U.S. troops in
South Korea _ based here under a mutual defense pact _ hinders
reunification of the two Koreas.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Tuesday that U.S.
troops would stay in South Korea ``as long as the Korean people want
us to stay.''
   ``The threat from the North has not abated, and the North Koreans
continue to modernize their armed forces and deploy them forward in
a threatening manner,'' Carlucci said after arriving in Seoul.
   Carlucci and many other American officers are here for annual
U.S.-South Korean security consultations, which will include U.S.
security help to ensure a successful Olympics. The Games begin Sept.
19 in Seoul.

<HEAD>White House AIDS Commission Takes Up Watkins Recommendations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House AIDS commission opened debate
today on its chairman's 579 proposed recommendations, amid
indications there will be a lot of talk but little real controversy
over most of them.
   ``There is no controversy in the first 11 chapters,'' William B.
Walsh told fellow commissioners.
   Those chapters contain all of the recommendations _ except those
calling for granting the surgeon general sweeping powers to deal
with the epidemic.
   Walsh made clear to the panel chairman, retired Navy Adm. James
D. Watkins, that he does not agree with his recommendations for
essentially turning the AIDS fight over to Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop.
   Watkins said he was determined that the commission make some
recommendation to President Reagan on the best way to structure the
federal health bureaucracy to deal with AIDS.
   ``It is not well done today,'' said Watkins.
   Government bureaucracies usually work, except when they have to
move quickly in emergencies, said Watkins, a former member of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. And AIDS, he said, is a national health
emergency.
   While saying he was not necessarily determined to stick to his
recommendation that the surgeon general head the fight, Watkins said
the commission has a responsibility to reach a consensus because
``we're in the best position to do it.''
   A cornerstone of the recommendations Watkins made last Thursday
was a call for federal legislation to protect from discrimination
people who have the AIDS virus.
   Although somewhat controversial because it runs counter to the
Reagan administration's stated position, there was clear consensus
on the commission to retain that in the final report due at the
White House June 24.
   Walsh expressed slight reservation about whether Congress should
be getting into that area, but made clear that he favors some kind
of anti-discrimination protection.
   ``If we're going to make it, we should expand it to cover not
just AIDS, but all diseases,'' he said.
   After brief opening remarks, the commission began a page-by-page
discussion of the 269-page report.
   It plans at least two more days of meetings next Thursday and
Friday to vote on the final version, running into the weekend if
necessary to complete deliberations.

   Warm air from Central Asia settled over Moscow on
Tuesday, driving the temperature to 95 degrees and setting a record
for the month of June.
   Office workers shed coats and ties and long lines formed at
kiosks selling ice-cream and kvass, a cool drink made from brown
bread and sugar or honey.
   The unusually warm weather was caused by hot winds blowing from
the steppes of Kazakhstan in Soviet Central Asia, meteorologist
Alexander Snitkovsky told the official Soviet news agency Tass.
   The record temperature for Moscow in the 109 years that records
have been kept was 99 degrees in August 1920, Tass quoted Snitkovsky
as saying.

   Two state prison inmates hope to profit from

   Ralph Woodward, who is serving 11 to 20 years for breaking and
entering, said he and another inmate claimed a cloth that covered a
place where Mother Teresa sat during a special Mass at the Concord
prison Saturday.
   Woodward said they will use the money for such things as
education after they leave prison.
   ``We just feel that this is a blessing bestowed upon us,''
Woodward told The Boston Globe. ``The fact that she came here is a
miracle and now we have the cloth _ well, it's just phenomenal. And
the fact that other people will have the pieces will just spread the
blessing around.''
   Mother Teresa, who founded a charitable order in India, visited
three Massachusetts prisons Saturday during a national tour.

<HEAD>Votes Switch Or Trade Bill Is Doomed, Senate Leaders Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional efforts to make the omnibus trade
bill law over President Reagan's veto are doomed unless sponsors can
switch a handful of votes before Wednesday's showdown on the Senate
floor, leaders said Tuesday.
   ``I hope enough senators will change their minds tomorrow ... and
override the president's veto,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters.
   Byrd said he could not change the votes and could only hope that
last-minute home-state pressure would cause three senators to relent
and provide the two-thirds margin needed to override Reagan's veto
of the 1,000-page bill, designed to strengthen the U.S. position in
the international marketplace.
   Centerpiece provisions would overhaul the system under which the
government imposes import curbs as a means of aiding U.S. industries
and punishing international trade violations by other countries.
   A wide array of other provisions range from hefty agricultural
subsidies to repeal of the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil-industry
earnings.
   The president vetoed the bill May 24, focusing heavily on
opposition to a provision that would require companies with 100
employees or more to provide notice to their workers of impending
plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   In short order, the House voted 308-113 to override the veto and
approve the bill. But supporters of the measure have found the
Senate tougher going.
   ``We're winning,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., a
critic of the measure, told reporters. ``We've got 36'' votes.
   Even if one senator, Democrat Joseph Biden of Delaware, were not
at home recuperating from surgery, opponents would be able to put an
override out of reach if they could muster 34 votes in the
100-member Senate.
   The administration has said it wants a more moderate version of
the trade bill once the Senate sustains the veto.
   There has been cloakroom talk that some senators looking at their
re-election campaigns feel more comfortable about supporting the
veto if they are assured that there will be another chance to vote
on the trade issue before Congress adjourns in October.
   But it remains uncertain whether there will be such a second
bill. Byrd has repeatedly raised the possibility that a raft of
potential amendments that already have been taken care of over the
last three years would reappear and stall the measure amid lengthy
debate.
   ``There will have to be some agreement between the ledership and
the committee to hold off amendments,'' Dole said. He said there was
scant precedent for such a procedure.
   Failure to approve a trade bill ``would be an issue'' in fall
campaigns, ``but I don't think an overriding issue,'' Dole said.
   Byrd said Reagan ``made a serious mistake on this veto'' because
in disregarding the appeal of the plant-closings provision, ``the
president has written off an issue that involves decency and right.''
   ``The president was poorly advised on it,'' Byrd said.

   Michael Dukakis, on the verge of claiming the
majority he needs to wrap up the Democratic presidential nomination,
said today he and Jesse Jackson ``talked in general terms'' about a
future role for Jackson.
   As voters went to the polls in California and three other final
primary states, Dukakis talked positively about the primary season
and the months to come.
   He said he discussed a role for Jackson in a Dukakis
administration when the two met late last night and early this
morning.
   ``We talked in general terms about that,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis said they did not discuss the vice presidential spot.
   ``Tomorrow's another day and I'll be thinking about running mates
providing today is a good day,'' he told reporters.
   The Massachusetts governor was also poised to finally gain the
endorsement of banished rivals Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and
Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois on Wednesday.
   His wife, Kitty, said she was confident the final primaries would
put her husband over the top in his march toward the 2,081 delegates
needed to clinch the nomination.
   ``I think Michael will do well and I'm hoping by the eighth of
June that he will have sewn up the convention,'' Mrs. Dukakis said
in a telephone interview from her hospital bed in Boston.
   Going into today's final round, Dukakis held 1,900 of the 2,081
delegates needed to win the nomination.
   Dukakis, campaigning at a high school in the San Fernando Valley
around Los Angeles, said he hoped to clinch that magic number of
delegates tonight. The campaign was clearly confident he would
secure what was needed from the more than 450 delegates up for grabs
on Tuesday, most of them in California and the remainder in New
Jersey, New Mexico and Montana.
   The Dukakis campaign would like to declare it has gone over the
top in the delegate race tonight or Wednesday morning, before the
candidate flies back to Massachusetts.
   Dukakis' wife Kitty, who is recuperating from spinal surgery at a
Boston hospital, said she planned to watch the California returns
from her hospital bed. ``I'm excited about tomorrow,'' she said.
   Spokesman Martin Bander of Massachusetts General Hospital said
Mrs. Dukakis could be discharged within a week.
   A Dukakis campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Dukakis would stop in Missouri on his way home Wednesday and
pick up an endorsement from former rival Rep. Richard Gephardt. The
official also said Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who has suspended his
Democratic campaign, would endorse Dukakis in Washington on
Wednesday.
   Throughout his last day of primary campaigning, Dukakis looked
back on his long quest for his party's nomination _ one that began
publicly with a trip in early February 1987 to Osceola, Iowa, a
small town in the state where the first caucuses were held a year
later.
   ``It's by no means the end tomorrow,'' he told a lunchtime crowd
at a San Diego plaza. ``It's the beginning, the beginning of a
Democratic victory in the fall.''
   Dukakis jabbed briefly at his likely Republican opponent for the
fall, George Bush, over the issue of drilling for oil off the
California coast, and spoke of Democratic unity when asked about
Jackson.
   ``If the tables were reversed, and he was on his way to the
nomination and I was the runner up, I'd expect to be deeply involved
... I'd try to bring my people into this. I'd be as much service to
the ticket as I possibly could,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I'm confident he will be that kind of person,'' he added.
   ``We'll be reaching out to supporters of Jesse, and the other
Democratic candidates, as we have already,'' Dukakis said. ``The
response has been terrific. I'm really overwhelmed by the good
feeling, the spirit, the confidence. A sense of victory is in the
air.''
   Dukakis aides sought to minimize the impact of Jackson's remarks
the same day, in which he suggested he would go to the Democratic
National Convention floor to fight over the platform on South Africa
if Dukakis did not alter his position to meet Jackson's. Jackson has
pressed Dukakis to say he was willing to brand South Africa a
terrorist state.
   Dukakis issues director Jim Steinberg said, ``There is a broad
basis for agreement here.
   ``Gov. Dukakis and Rev. Jackson share the same fundamental
commitment on issues relating to South Africa,'' Steinberg said.
``They both want to see an end to apartheid and to take strong and
effective steps both by the United States and by the international
community.''

   Thousands of high school students will
celebrate graduation until the sun comes up at a $35,000 party
Saturday, provided they get their parents' OK and promise to abstain
from drugs and alcohol.
   ``If the alcohol industry is not above bribing them into thinking
they can only have a good time if they're drinking, I'm not above
bribing them into letting them know they can have a good time
without drinking,'' said Anne Barnes, statewide coordinator for
``Project Graduation.''
   Saturday night's party is sponsored by the Wake County PTA
Council, with support from Students Against Drunk Driving, Mothers
Against Drunk Driving and some businesses.
   Teen-agers and local officials held similar affairs at a theme
park outside Charlotte last weekend. Statewide, at least 10
communities are involved in ``Project Graduation,'' officials say.
   Wake County's party, for up to 3,000 students, is scheduled from
8 p.m to 5 a.m. and features three bands, food, a 14-foot-wide
television screen, video games, and a casino. There are prizes of a
new car and trips to Paris, Florida, the Bahamas and across the
continental United States, as well as stereo systems and color
televisions.
   ``They (the students) pledge to stay for the entire time, and not
to use alcohol or drugs,'' said JoAnne Smith, a teacher and
counselor at Broughton High School in Raleigh. ``Without both forms
they don't receive an invitation, and without an invitation, they
don't get in.''
   The hours, she said, are based on drunken driving statistics.
   ``More deaths among people 16 to 20 years old occur in the months
of May and June between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,'' she said.
``Most of these are kids coming back from graduation parties or high
school proms.''
   Organizers have 300 volunteer chaperones, and 40 off-duty police
officers will handle security.

   Attorneys for the former president of Beech-Nut
Nutrition Corp., who was convicted of distributing phony apple
juice, want their client to speak to students about his mistakes as
an alternative to prison.
   Niels Hoyvald was found guilty Feb. 17 of 351 counts of violating
the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Each count carries a
possible three-year prison term and a $10,000 fine.
   Hoyvald and a co-defendant, former Beech-Nut Vice President John
Lavery, are to be sentenced Friday in U.S. District Court. Lavery
was found guilty of 429 counts of violating the same act, along with
18 counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy.
   Hoyvald's attorneys, Brendan Sullivan Jr. and Barry Simon, said
in a presentencing memorandum that the impact of ethics lessons on
business students ``would be far clearer coming from Niels Hoyvald,
whose career has been shattered because he did not heed it, than it
could ever be coming from a textbook or a professor.''
   Thomas Roche, the executive assistant U.S. attorney who was the
lead prosecutor in the case, said the government's sentencing
recommendations would be made public at the hearing. He declined
comment on the memorandum.
   Hoyvald, president and chief executive officer of Beech-Nut from
April 1981 until shortly before his indictment in November 1986,
said during the trial that he did not know about the distribution of
flavored sugar water as juice until June 25, 1982.
   After that date, Hoyvald said, he relied on the advice of
attorneys in allowing continued distribution of the phony juice.
According to the government, the product contained little or no
apple juice.
   Beech-Nut, based in Fort Washington, Pa., is a subsidiary of
Nestle S.A. of Switzerland.

   Tawana Brawley's mother will seek asylum in a
black church rather than submit to arrest for her refusal to testify
before a grand jury investigating her daughter's disappearance, her
attorneys said today.
   ``Glenda Brawley will not be appearing before a Dutchess County
grand jury tomorrow,'' her attorney, Alton Maddox Jr., told
reporters. ``Glenda Brawley will be seeking relief before a higher
authority, she will be putting her life in God's hands.''
   Mrs. Brawley was sentenced to 30 days in jail Monday for defying
a grand jury subpoena to testify in the case, but state Attorney
General Robert Abrams urged authorities to give her one more chance
to explain her refusal to cooperate to a judge on Wednesday.
   Brawley's family has claimed investigators and state officials
are engaged in a racially motivated cover-up. Mrs. Brawley, 33, was
not in the Dutchess County courtroom when state Supreme Court
Justice Angelo Ingrassia sentenced her to jail and fined her $250.
   Maddox was flanked by attorney C. Vernon Mason and the Rev. Al
Sharpton as he spoke to reporters on the steps of Queens state
Supreme Court, where they attended a hearing in connection with
demonstrations they led in New York City last winter.
   The three men refused to say what church would offer Mrs. Brawley
asylum. But they insisted that the government does not have the
right to violate the sanctuary of a church to arrest her for
contempt of a grand jury.
   Abrams said Monday that unless the family of Tawana Brawley
starts cooperating soon, ``we'll have to start winding down the
investigation.''
   The grand jury will hold its next session Wednesday.
   Tawana Brawley, 16, was found Nov. 28 lying in a plastic bag in
Wappingers Falls, about 10 miles north of here and 95 miles north of
New York City. Her hair was cut, animal excrement was smeared on her
and racial epithets were scrawled on her body. She said she had been
attacked by six white men, including one who flashed a police-like
badge.
   In one of several testy exchanges Monday with Judge Angelo
Ingrassia, Maddox said the hearing was a ``futile exercise'' and
that Mrs. Brawley would not get justice in a system that has been
opressing blacks for hundreds of years.
   Ingrassia said that since the only reasons for the refusal to
testify were political, he had no choice but to hold her in contempt.
   About an hour before the judge's order, Mrs. Brawley left the
courthouse with the Rev. Al Sharpton, a family adviser, and Nation
of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. She did not appear in the courtroom.
   Following the proceedings, Maddox and roughly 300 supporters who
came by bus from New York City marched down a street. They were
surrounded by a dozen bodyguards with linked arms and did not
respond to reporters' questions.
   During the hearing, Brawley attorneys twice asked Ingrassia to
disqualify himself, saying he had a connection to Gov. Mario Cuomo
and that he had not taken a leadership role in preventing news leaks
about the investigation.
   Ingrassia said he never met Cuomo, and refused to disqualify
himself.
   Brawley attorneys had sought to subpoena several officials,
including Cuomo, but Ingrassia rejected the requests.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, poised to lock up his party's
presidential nomination, said he would start considering running
mates on Wednesday _ ``providing today is a good day'' in the final
four primaries.
   The night before, Dukakis exulted that ``victory is in the air,''
while remaining rival Jesse Jackson looked back with pride, calling
his historic candidacy a ``catalyst for growth.''
   Republican George Bush, who has the GOP nomination in the bag,
expressed eagerness to face Dukakis in the fall. He said the two
have many differences and ``I am ... on the right side.''
   Today, in an interview with ABC-TV, Bush tried to deflect an
issue he is sure to face throughout the campaign _ his involvement
or non-involvement in the Iran-Contra affair _ by questioning
whether U.S. arms were sent to Iran in exchange for hostages'
freedom after all.
   ``I'm not sure they were released for anything to do with arms
for hostages.'' he said. Pressed as to why three U.S. citizens were
released from captivity in Lebanon, Bush said, ``Totally because of
that, no. ... There was some inclination on the part of the
hostage-holders that they thought they might get something in
return. ... It's not all that clear.''
   Dukakis said today there may well be ``a floor fight or two''
with Jackson and his supporters at the Democratic National
Convention next month, but he added, ``I don't see any great
divisions within our party.''
   He said the United States ``must go far beyond our current
sanctions'' against South Africa. But he stopped short of calling
South Africa a terrorist nation, a label demanded of Dukakis and the
party by Jackson.
   Dukakis said he and Jackson talked in general terms of Jackson's
post-primary role in the party during a meeting late Monday night,
but he would not give details. He said the vice presidency was not
discussed.
   Jackson said today the two had discussed South Africa and other
issues such as Jackson's complaints about delegate selection.
   ``He's sensitive on these matters and we're going to have some
follow-up meetings, necessarily to discuss matters of platform,
credentials, rules, the convention itself, and beyond that our
strategy for winning in November,'' Jackson told reporters.
   The four-month presidential primary season closed today with
races in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana. All three
presidential contenders were in California today, and all were
staying in the state tonight to wait out the results of the day's
contests.
   Early turnout was reported light in New Jersey and moderate in
New Mexico.
   The biggest prize is California, and an ABC News tracking poll
indicated Dukakis led Jackson in the state by a 2-1 margin, 61
percent to 30 percent. The survey, based on 415 interviews Saturday
and Sunday, had a margin of error of 6 percentage points, the
network reported Monday night.
   California officials were predicting a low turnout, however.
Secretary of State March Fong Eu said she expected a turnout of 48
percent, which would be the lowest in more than 40 years.
   Before today's voting began, Dukakis had nearly 1,900 delegates,
leaving him fewer than 200 shy of the 2,081 needed to nominate. On
Monday alone, more than 70 delegates flocked to the Dukakis camp.
Jackson trails with less than 1,000 delegates.
   There were 466 delegates at stake in today's primaries.
   In addition, Dukakis' former rivals for the nomination were
lining up behind him. Campaign sources said Dukakis would travel to
Missouri on Wednesday, the day after the last primaries, to pick up
Rep. Richard Gephardt's endorsement. The same day, the sources said,
Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois was to endorse the Massachusetts
governor in Washington.
   Dukakis, not noted for his effusiveness, nonetheless sounded like
a happy man as he headed into the final contests.
   ``I'm really overwhelmed by the good feeling, the spirit, the
confidence. A sense of victory is in the air,'' he said as he
campaigned Monday in Los Angeles.
   Jackson, however, suffered a primary-eve embarrassment when he
missed the first 16 minutes of a live half-hour statewide broadcast
that was supposed to showcase his campaign and provide a platform
for a dramatic final appeal.
   Jackson told The New York Times in an interview published today
that he had ``earned the option'' to be offered the vice
presidential spot. He had said previously he deserved consideration
for the post.
   In recent weeks, Jackson has been looking ahead to the convention
and pressing his platform demands. But he has also been looking back
at the most successful presidential campaign ever waged by a black
candidate. Jackson said his candidacy has helped build racial
tolerance.
   ``It's clear America has become more and more accustomed to Jesse
Jackson as a possible next president,'' he said Monday. ``It's a
matter of growth. I'm the stimulus. I'm the catalyst for that
growth.''
   Bush, meanwhile, got a primary-eve boost of sorts from the Reagan
administration. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel announced Monday
night that he was suspending plans for a controversial oil-drilling
project off the California coast.
   Earlier this week, in what was then a step away from the
administration, the vice president called for a delay in the
project. The two Democrats oppose it outright, and Dukakis had
faulted Bush for failing to do likewise.
   Bush, speaking to a Republican audience on Monday, said he
``can't wait for this primary season to end'' so he can go
head-to-head with Dukakis.
   For Bush, the primary season has been over for some time. He
clinched the 1,139 delegates he needed for the GOP nomination back
in April. But the Republican competition effectively ended three
months ago, when the vice president racked up landslide wins across
the South.

   Justice Minister Anna-Greta Leijon
resigned Tuesday over a secret investigation she authorized in the
Olof Palme murder case, averting a confidence vote that threatened
to bring down the government.
   Mrs. Leijon, 49, was the highest-ranking woman in Swedish
politics and a ranking figure in the Social Democratic Party.
Critics accused her of overstepping her authority by approving the
secret probe of Prime Minister Palme's assassination, which has
stumped police.
   Palme was shot to death on a downtown street the night of Feb.
28, 1986, while walking home from a movie with his wife. The killer
has not been found and no motive has been established.
   Sweden has offered a reward of 50 million kronor ($8.4 million)
for information leading to the killer.
   The resignation forestalled a no-confidence motion in Parliament
that Ingvar Carlsson, Palme's successor, appeared certain to lose.
It was an embarrassing setback for the Social Democrats, who lead a
minority government, three months before general elections.
   ``A majority in the Riksdag (parliament) has decided that I
should resign, and that leaves me no option,'' Mrs. Leijon told a
news conference.
   She authorized a friend to look into allegations that Iran
ordered the killing because Palme had stopped illegal Swedish arms
sales to Iran.
   Bypassing official investigators, she arranged for publisher Ebbe
Carlsson to reopen the probe of the alleged Iranian connection. He
is not related to the current prime minister.
   No results of his efforts have been disclosed.
   Press reports say his investigation began in April. A letter
written by Mrs. Leijon, for Carlsson to carry to Britain, was dated
in May.
   Police had spent a year looking into the alleged Iranian
connection and the possibility that Kurdish exiles were involved.
Hans Holmer, a close friend of the publisher, was fired as police
commissioner when he refused to give up on the theory.
   The outcry about the unofficial project increased after
disclosures of irregularities _ including that the publisher's
bodyguard smuggled forbidden eavesdropping equipment into Sweden.
The secret operation was financed by a contribution of 2 million
kronor ($343,000) from a banker.
   Prime Minister Carlsson said he will give Mrs. Leijon a prominent
post in the next Cabinet if his party wins the September elections.
   ``She's been a great minister, one of the best, but she has made
one mistake and the opposition could not overlook that,'' he said.
``She is resigning today from the government but she has a lot left
to do in politics.'' He appointed Industry Minister Thage G.
Peterson to act as justice minister until the election.
   Mrs. Leijon was forced to quit when the small Communist Party,
which normally supports Carlsson's minority government, decided
Monday it would join the opposition in a no-confidence vote.
   Center Party leader Olof Johannson said: ``She hasn't followed
the rules of the game in our democracy. That's why she had to go.
It's clear that she broke the code of procedure and went beyond the
constitution.''
   She was the third justice minister to resign under a cloud since
the Social Democrats took office in 1982.
   Sten Wickbom quit in October after a convicted spy escaped while
on an unguarded conjugal furlough from prison. In 1983, Ove Rainer
resigned for allegedly taking advantage of tax loopholes.
   Mrs. Leijon was the first justice minister who was not a lawyer
by training, and the first woman to hold the job. She favored
tougher punishments for criminals and took a strong stand against
terrorism.

   Religious dissidents demanded Tuesday that Russian
Orthodox Church leaders renounce the church's adulation of Josef V.
Stalin, who brutally repressed believers during his rule.
   ``It's the responsibility of the church to announce which side it
is on _ the side of perestroika or the side of Stalinism,'' Father
Gleb Yakunin told reporters in a Moscow apartment.
   ``A person cannot be renewed in his personal life unless he
repents. This is true of the church, too,'' he said.
   Yakunin and other religious activists met with reporters on the
second day of the Russian Orthodox Church local council in Zagorsk,
northeast of Moscow, The council is at the center of celebrations of
the faith's 1,000th anniversary.
   Soviet society is reevaluating Stalin's role in history, and
Soviets from Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev on down have
sharply criticized the purges in which millions of people were
killed or exiled.
   The church has kept silent, and dissidents demanded that the
hierarchy join in the criticism of Stalin.
   Almost 100 believers from around the Soviet Union crowded in a
few small rooms in a Moscow apartment for the beginning of an
unofficial three-day seminar on religious problems in the Soviet
Union.
   Yakunin and other church activists released copies of an appeal
they sent to Patriarch Pimen, the Russian Orthodox Church leader,
asking that the church council condemn a 1949 letter the council
sent to Stalin for his 70th birthday, ``basically canonizing'' the
dictator.
   The church wrote Stalin that it was ``forever grateful to you for
your attentiveness to its needs.''
   Yakunin several months ago called on the ailing 77-year-old Pimen
to resign to allow a younger, more energetic church leader to take
advantage of Gorbachev's reforms.
   Yakunin was barred from performing religious rites from 1966
until last year because of his criticism of church officials, and he
is a former political prisoner. In August, the church gave him a
small parish near Moscow.
   Thousands of priests were exiled or killed during repression
following the Bolshevik revolution in 1917. After Stalin took power,
a law was passed in 1929 sharply restricting church activities. The
church faced its severest repression in the 1930s.
   The dissidents criticized the selection of delegates for the
church council in Zagorsk and the amount of money being spent on the
millennium celebration.
   Ceremonies scheduled at Moscow's Bolshoi Theater threaten to turn
the event in a ``pompous, theatrical action,'' Yakunin said.
   Each day of the weeklong celebration costs about $1.6 million, he
said.
   Another dissident priest, Georgy Edelshtein of Kostroma,
northeast of Moscow, said representatives to the council were chosen
by bishops rather than by meetings of lay people, priests and
deacons.
   Dissidents said priests and believers were kept in the dark about
the selection of nine candidates for sainthood.
   In Rome, a Vatican source said Vatican Secretary of State
Agostino Casaroli, who arrives Wednesday as Pope John Paul II's
representative at millennium celebrations, will carry a letter from
the Polish-born pontiff to Gorbachev.
   There was no information on whether John Paul's message to
Gorbachev would touch on the situation of the Ukrainian Catholic
Church, which is not officially recognized but operates underground
in the western Ukraine.
   The Russian Orthodox Church is opposed to official recognition of
the Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   A top church official said Saturday that recognition of it would
hurt improving relations between Rome and the Russian Orthodox
Church, but that the two sides would discuss the issue in Finland
later this month.
   A priest of the underground church, Yevgeny Genrikhs, told the
news conference that the Russian church has no right to help decide
the issue.
   ``If this is the price the Russian Orthodox Church is willing to
pay, to deprive people of their church, then who needs this kind of
Christian unity?'' he said.

<HEAD>Former Sect Member Sentenced for Four Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former professional football player who pleaded
guilty to killing four men, including two drifters whose ears were
cut off, was sentenced today to 22 years in prison.
   Robert Rosier, 31, who had been a member of the Yahweh sect, must
serve at least three years in prison. He could have been sentenced
to up to 27 years in prison.
   Dade Circuit Judge Ellen Morphonious' sentence was agreed upon as
part of Rosier's guilty pleas to four counts of second-degree
murder, said his attorney, Jeffrey Weinkle.
   Security was tight during the sentencing. Rosier, who played
defensive end briefly in 1979 for the St. Louis Cardinals of the
National Football League, wore the robe of the Yahweh sect even
though he was excommunicated in June 1987.
   Members of the virtually all-black sect have claimed to be the
true Jews and said their leader was the Messiah. They now downplay
those ideas, seeking a more moderate image, but the group has been
tainted by allegations of violence.
   Federal authorities have questioned Rosier about the sect's
alleged links to as many as 12 killings. The sect says it has about
8,000 members in Dade County.
   Rosier pleaded guilty to the October 1986 shooting deaths of
Anthony Brown and Rudolph Broussard, both of Opa-locka, and the
September 1986 stabbing deaths of drifters Raymond Kelley and Cecil
Branch.
   Brown and Broussard were killed when sect members tried to evict
them from a crime-ridden apartment building as part of the sect's
effort to fight drug trafficking.

   Jesse Jackson said today he has not decided
whether he would accept the Democratic vice presidential nomination,
if it is offered, but he said ``It is an option my constituency has
earned.''
   On the final primary day of the season, Jackson carefully
outlined his position on the vice presidency in an interview with
ABC-TV.
   Asked whether Dukakis should offer him the vice presidency,
Jackson said, ``If he were to win, extending the invitation to me is
his option.'' He said he did not know whether he would accept, but
then added, ``It is an option my constituency has earned.''
   Jackson and Dukakis met Monday night and again today. Jackson
said they talked about a wide range of concerns, from his call on
Dukakis to term South Africa a terrorist state to his criticisms of
the delegate selection process.
   ``He's sensitive on these matters and we're going to have some
followup meetings, necessarily to discuss matters of platform,
credentials, rules, the convention itself, and beyond that, our
strategy for winning in November,'' Jackson said.
   ``As we increase our own security level, one with the other ...
we accept our responsibility to guide our party to victory.''
   Jackson concluded his primary campaign on a rough note, arriving
late to his half-hour television program Monday night as it was
broadcast in California's major markets. He had fallen behind
schedule in earlier campaign appearances in San Francisco.
   As Jackson raced from the airport, disc jockey Casey Kasem, a
longtime supporter, filled the gap by interviewing Jackson's state
campaign manager, Chris Hammond.
   The show, costing the campaign $150,000, also featured footage of
Jackson speaking to crowds in a video montage with a song about
Jackson and the issues he has addressed in the campaign.
   When Jackson arrived, he and Kasem spent the rest of the program
discussing his campaign issues.
   ``I want to address our youth,'' Jackson said in closing,
``revive their spirit, renew their faith, keep hope alive.... I
offer authentic leadership.''
   Jackson earlier put Dukakis on notice that he will wage a
convention floor fight over the Massachusetts governor's refusal to
say South Africa should be declared a terrorist state.
   ``Mr. Dukakis has proceeded rather cautiously and
conservatively,'' Jackson said in a radio news conference during
which he also criticized Dukakis' leadership.
   ``He has not been willing to declare South Africa a terrorist
state. By any definition of a terrorist state, South Africa
qualifies,'' Jackson said.
   In the strongest terms he has used to date to indicate his
priorities for the party convention in Atlanta, Jackson said, ``If
he will not bend on that matter, we'll simply meet on the floor in
Atlanta.''
   Speaking on the eve of today's primaries in California, New
Jersey, Montana and New Mexico, Jackson indicated he will fight to
bend the convention to his concerns, but will do it within the
structure of the party rules.
   ``It's not just what I want. I represent a constituency,'' he
told a rally in Richmond, Calif. ``What do my constituents want? ...
What renews their faith, what makes their hope alive?'' he said. He
then listed a litany of his campaign issues over such things as
comparable pay for women, affordable housing and health care and
fair prices for farmers.
   Jackson also said he plans to ``use the rules to have fair
rules'' regarding delegate selection procedures that he considers
unfair.
   Jackson has been after Dukakis to join him in calling for
designation of South Africa as a terrorist state because of
Pretoria's backing for the brutal rebels in Mozambique and its
policies of apartheid, press censorship and civil liberties
restrictions.
   Countries on the U.S. list of terrorist nations, such as Libya,
North Korea and Cuba, are subject to trade and political sanctions.
   Jackson said he is ``convinced the ticket will take a strong
position against apartheid and declare South Africa to be a
terrorist state.''
   And Dukakis ``either ... will offer leadership on these basic
issues or be following the wave of a convention taking him out to
sea.''
   Asked how he could support the likely nominee if Dukakis, as
Jackson contends, lacks leadership, Jackson replied, ``It's not a
question of integrity, it's a question of judgement and priorities.
And the governor like all of us will keep expanding and keep
growing.''
   He also said Dukakis' willingness to use nuclear weapons in a
first strike showed ``very bad judgment.''

   A man accused of trying to sell his
5-year-old daughter for $100,000 says he hopes his guilty plea in
the case will end a dark episode in his life.
   Joseph Waltman, 24, faces a maximum of five years in prison and a
$75,000 fine on his guilty plea to a charge of endangering the
welfare of a child.
   After entering the plea Monday in Superior Court, Waltman said he
hoped to start a new life, but ``whether I'm going to be left alone
or not by other folks remains to be seen.''
   Waltman, of the southern New Jersey township of Alloway, was
arrested March 19, 1987, in the Giants Stadium parking lot in East
Rutherford when he allegedly tried to sell his daughter, Rachel
Rauser, to the girl's uncle, Gary Stern.
   Waltman had approached Stern previously with the offer, and the
uncle then informed authorities and cooperated in the arrest.
   Stern and his wife, Deborah, of Sunrise, Fla., were granted
custody last December in a three-way custody fight with other
relatives, and they adopted the girl last month.
   Rachel's mother, Michal Rauser, died in a car accident in 1984,
and a judge awarded the girl a $3 million settlement. Rachel will
receive a lump-sum payment when she reaches 18 and monthly payments
of $1,500 for life.
   Waltman, who is free on $10,000 bond, will be sentenced July 13.
Charges of conspiracy and illegally placing a child for adoption
were dropped as part of a plea bargain.

   One of the latest tricks among crooks is ketchup,
police in Florida and New York say.
   ``Ketchup is one of the new techniques in the distraction game,''
Metro-Dade Detective Luis Vergara said.
   A victim is squirted in the back with ketchup from a packet like
those given in fast-food restaurants. A stranger points out the
stain, offering tissue to wipe off the mess. While the target cleans
up, the stranger's accomplice makes the theft.
   Police in Miami arrested three suspects Sunday. There have been
nine cases since March 25 at the Fort Lauderdale airport. In New
York, the police fraud squad calls it the ``ketchup caper.''
   ``Ketchup is very big here,'' New York Detective James Tortora
said. ``They get them when they are kneeling down at St. Patrick's.
While you are saying your `Hail Marys,' you get hit with ketchup and
they are walking out the door with your handbag.''

<HEAD>US Regrets Cancellation of Colombian Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department expressed regret Tuesday
that the kidnaping of a prominent Colombian opposition leader has
forced cancellation of a planned three-day visit here this week by
President Virgilio Barco.
   ``We understand the reasons behind the cancellation and
sympathize with the Colombian government,'' spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said.
   The cancellation was precipitated by the kidnaping on May 29 of
Alvaro Gomez Hurtado, a former ambassador to Washington who ran
against Barco in the 1986 elections as the Conservative Party
candidate.
   He was kidnapped by armed gunmen as he was leaving church
services.
   Mrs. Oakley said the United States deplores ``the violent acts of
individuals and groups in Colombia and continues to hope that
Ambassador Gomez will be returned to his family.''
   Under questioning, Mrs. Oakley disagreed with the suggestion that
the cancellation demonstrates that drug traffickers and terrorists
control Colombia's political life.
   Rather, she said, it reflects Barco's concern over the situation
created by Gomez's kidnapping and does not demonstrate anything ``of
a political nature.''

   Intake valves were ordered turned off from
this northeastern Kentucky town's water supply source early Tuesday
as sludge from an underground tire fire poured into the Little Sandy
River.
   The blaze, which started Monday and involved possibly 200,000
discarded auto tires in a dump the size of a football field, was
producing a runoff of ``extremely contaminated and toxic oil,''
according to Don Armstrong, a spokesman for the state Division of
Disaster and Emergency Services.
   ``This has rather serious environmental implications because one
tire can produce as much as three gallons of oil,'' Armstrong said.
   The owner of the property, Charles Blythe, and his family were
evacuated, Armstrong said. He said Blythe owned a home, a hobby shop
and a storage unit on the property.
   ``It doesn't appear it (the fire) will be real easy to get put
out, so we're looking at alternatives to decide which way to go,''
said William C. Burger, environmental response coordinator for the
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet.
   Burger said two booms were placed across the river, and water
company officials downstream were notified.
   Water intake valves on the river were shut off at 3 a.m.,
according to John Kinner, mayor of the town of 1,400 people.
   Greenup has just 38,000 gallons of reserve water for emergencies,
Armstrong said. Kinner said residents have been asked to conserve,
and tanker trucks may be brought in to supply drinking water.
   Kinner said the valves could be closed for 24 hours.

   Three space shuttle astronauts made a
tricky mock emergency landing Tuesday during a comprehensive launch
rehearsal that tested hundreds of changes resulting from the
Challenger disaster.
   The practice for the nation's first shuttle mission in 2{ years,
scheduled Aug. 31, exercised the launch team here and flight
controllers in Houston through the final three hours of a countdown
and the harrowing minutes of a failure requiring split-second
decisions.
   Astronaut Bob Crippen, deputy director of shuttle operations who
will make the final decision on whether a shuttle should be
launched, said the test pointed up a few areas in problem-solving
that needed to be improved, but ``all in all, it was an excellent
exercise.''
   Challenger's seven astronauts died when a faulty booster rocket
caused their spaceship to explode Jan. 28, 1986. With the two
boosters still attached and burning, the crew had no chance to
escape; that is still the case.
   The simulated failure Tuesday of two of the three main engines
occurred seconds after the boosters ``burned out'' normally and were
jettisoned, enabling the three astronauts, operating in a Houston
simulator, to execute an abort maneuver called ``return to launch
site,'' or RTLS.
   ``We think we've lost the left engine,'' astronaut Loren Shriver,
the simulator commander, told mission control slightly more than two
minutes after the pretend liftoff.
   ``Discovery, we confirm the left engine is down. Abort RTLS,''
the control center radioed.
   Shriver and his crew members, James Wetherbee and Franklin
Chang-Diaz, ``flew'' the simulator to an altitude of about 75 miles
and 400 miles out over the Atlantic Ocean to exhaust hundreds of
thousands of gallons of fuel.
   With a second engine now ``locked up and useless,'' the
astronauts pitched around, went through the motions of jettisoning
their huge external fuel tank into the ocean and, battling hydraulic
and other difficulties, glided to the make-believe touchdown on a
runway three miles from the launch pad. Landing occurred 21 minutes
after the abort maneuver began.
   Observing in Houston were commander Rick Hauck and the four
members of his crew who will fly the four-day Discovery mission in
August.
   Because of the Challenger accident, NASA has introduced hundreds
of changes, most aimed at safety, into the launch process. The
changes include new procedures, management responsibilities and
ground and flight hardware and software.
   The simulation Tuesday was the only opportunity to check them out
with the launch-day team before the actual countdown.
   Under the new management structure, one man, Crippen, will make
the final go-no go decision on a shuttle launch. His main adviser is
launch director Bob Sieck. Both have scores of experts to call on.
   Crippen, a veteran of four shuttle missions, and Sieck exercised
their roles Tuesday as intentional electrical, communications and
other problems were built into the count to give controllers
experience in resolving them. A simulated high fuel pressure reading
31 seconds before liftoff would have scrubbed a real launch, but it
was bypassed so the test could continue. The trouble-shooting
delayed the simulated launch 55 minutes.
   The remaining three shuttles have been grounded since the
Challenger accident, with the major roadblock to flight being the
testing of the redesigned booster rocket. Two more full-scale firing
tests are scheduled June 10 and July 26.
   Discovery is undergoing final checks after a major overhaul and
is scheduled to be moved to the launch pad June 27.

<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government and
rebel negotiators resumed talks today, and sources on both sides
said they were close to agreeing on a definitive end to hostilities.
   As the talks began, Contra delegation leader Alfredo Cesar said:
``The Nicaraguan Resistance is here with a political decision to
sign a definite agreement for permanent and lasting peace in
Nicaragua if the government shows its political commitment to make
the democratic reforms in this country to achieve that lasting
peace.''
   A major stumbling block in the fourth round of the negotiations
on achieving a lasting peace is a timetable for disarming the
U.S.-backed rebels, sources said Monday.
   The Sandinistas want the rebels, known as Contras, to disarm by
September. The rebels want to do it by the end of January.
   At the last parley May 26-28, the Sandinistas made concessions on
what the rebels call the democratization of Nicaragua and pledged to
enact political reforms the Contras demand.
   But rebel representatives speaking privately to The Associated
Press said the reforms remained too ill-defined.
   They include freedom of the press, lifting of all political
restrictions, ending the ruling Sandinista National Liberation
Front's control of the army and government, the right to strike and
electoral reforms.
   The government also said it was willing to negotiate reforms
within the framework of its dialogue with the internal opposition.
   The Contras reluctantly agreed at the last negotiating session to
extend a 60-day cease-fire that would have expired May 31. But they
said they would not observe the truce past the end of this week's
talks.
   The government had announced a unilateral 30-day extension of the
truce.
   Since the talks last month, each side has accused the other of
violating the truce. At least one Sandinista army soldier and 10
rebels have been killed, according to the Defense Ministry.
   Cesar said Monday that the rebels were prepared to resume
fighting if the talks failed.
   ``The Nicaraguan Resistance does not want to reinitiate the war,
but if the Sandinista government suspends the conversations, our
forces will be ready,'' Cesar said in San Jose, Costa Rica.
   The Resistance is the Contras' umbrella organization.
   On Monday night, Vice President Sergio Ramirez told reporters an
accord with the rebels was ``a matter of moments because at best
within a month they will not have the capacity to negotiate more.''
   Ramirez also said negotiations only became possible because the
Reagan administration has been unable to win Congressional support
for continued military aid to the rebels.
   Despite their posturing, the government and rebels appear to be
closer to a permanent agreement than at any time since they signed
their historic peace outline on March 23 in the southern border town
of Sopoa.
   The Sandinista government needs to end the war, now in its
seventh year, to reconstruct an economy badly ravaged by the
fighting that has claimed more than 26,000 lives and to enact the
social programs it promised when it came to power in a 1979
revolution.
   At the same time, the Contras are experiencing deep divisions
among their ranks and were cut off from U.S. military assistance at
the end of February.

   A car bomb exploded near a Syrian army
checkpoint in south Beirut today, touching off a gun battle between
Syrian troops and pro-Iranian fundamentalist militiamen, police said.
   They said six people were killed and 40 wounded in the
mid-afternoon blast and ensuing shootout in south Beirut's seaside
Ouzai district. It was the third car bombing in Lebanon this year.
   Four people were killed and 39 wounded in the car bomb explosion,
police said. Among the injured were two Syrian soldiers and two
Lebanese policemen manning a joint checkpoint on the Ouzai highway,
police said.
   The site of the blast was about 300 feet from an office of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, the most radical Shiite
Moslem group in Lebanon.
   A carload of bearded Hezbollah gunmen raced to the scene. But
Syrian soldiers and Lebanese policemen ringing the blast site
intercepted the car and ordered its occupants out, police said.
   ``When the gunmen refused to step out, troops and policemen tried
to haul them out by force. One gunman fired his pistol and a
shootout erupted in which two gunmen were killed and a civilian
passer-by was wounded,'' said a police spokesman. He cannot be
identified by name under standing regulations.
   One of the dead gunmen was identified as Abu Ali Assaf, a
Hezbollah official.
   Reporters and photographers, watching from a distance, saw troops
and policemen beating the gunmen with rifle butts through the car's
open windows before the shooting began.
   One gunman was seen drawing a pistol and firing at the soldiers
and police, who opened up with submachine guns. Panicky onlookers
sprinted away.
   Syria deployed an estimated 2,400 troops in Beirut's southern
slums two weeks ago to quell three weeks of savage fighting between
Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian Shiite Amal militia.
   Police had said 296 people were killed and 1,000 wounded in the
war for control of slums, where most of the 18 foreigers kidnapped
in Lebanon are believed held.
   After the bomb-laden brown Datsun blew up at 4:05 p.m.,
ambulances were seen racing to and from the blast scene and fire
engines doused at least two burning cars with water hoses.
   Syrian troops and policemen quickly removed debris from the area,
where five shops were damaged.
   Today's car bombing came eight days after a car bomb detonated in
Christian east Beirut's Rmaeil residential neighborhood, killing 20
people and wounding 78.
   On April 23, a car bomb blew up in a crowded vegetable market in
the predominantly Sunni Moslem port city of Tripoli, killing 69
people and wounding 111.
   There has been no claim of responsibility for any of this year's
bombings. But leaders in Tripoli blamed the Lebanese Forces, the
Christians' main militia, for the blast there.
   The Lebanese Forces command, which denied involvement in the
bombing, accused the Syrian secret service of masterminding the
Rmaeil car bombing.

<HEAD>Attacks On Homosexuals Up Sharply as AIDS Makes Gays More Visible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AIDS epidemic has made America's homosexual
community more vulnerable to attack, according to a study released
Tuesday that said reported incidents of anti-gay violence rose 42
percent last year.
   A record 7,008 incidents, ranging from verbal abuse to murder,
were reported in 1987 to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force,
said Kevin Berrill, director of the group's Anti-Violence Project.
   The statistics were included in the report ``Anti-Gay Violence,
Victimization & Defamation in 1987,'' the third such annual study by
the gay-rights advocacy group.
   ``We are a community under siege,'' Berrill said at a news
conference. ``We are battling AIDS and we're battling violence.''
   AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ has made the gay
community more visible, Berrill said, and ``the downside of lesbian
and gay visibility is once you're more visible, you're more of a
target.''
   Fifteen percent of all incidents reported last year and 5 percent
of the physical assaults involved verbal reference to AIDS by the
perpetrators or were directed against people with the disease, the
study found.
   As in 1986, nearly two-thirds of the local groups reporting
anti-gay incidents last year believed that ``fear and hatred
associated with AIDS has fostered anti-gay violence in their
communities,'' according to the report.
   The overall statistics represented a small percentage of the
actual number of anti-gay incidents occurring last year, Berrill
said.
   ``Gay and lesbian victims are probably the least likely to report
of any hate crime victims,'' he said. ``Gay and lesbian people, by
reporting crimes against them to the police, risk losing their jobs,
their homes, and in some cases children.''
   Nevertheless, ``available data clearly demonstrate that the
problem continues to be severe,'' he said.
   Berrill called for federal and state legislation aimed at curbing
anti-gay violence and better education of the public.
   Another reason for the increase in incidents reported may have
been that the task force received more complete data than in the
prior studies, Berrill noted. The 7,008 incidents in 1987 were
reported by 64 groups in 32 states and the District of Columbia,
compared with 4,946 incidents from 41 groups in 27 states a year
earlier.
   The report was compiled by sending one-page questionnaires to
more than 150 groups in all 50 states requesting any available local
data on harassment or violence that occurred in 1987. Groups were
chosen based on the likelihood of knowledge about local incidents.
   Among those groups documenting greater violence last year were
San Francisco's Community United Against Violence, a gay
victim-assistance agency, which saw 11 percent more violence victims
in 1987 than in 1986. The New York City Gay and Lesbian
Anti-Violence Project said it served 14 percent more clients in
1987, and the Philadelphia Lesbian and Gay Task Force reported a 39
percent increase in violent incidents.
   The greatest increases came in acts of verbal harassment and
threats of violence, according to the report.
   ``Not only were there 1,990 more such incidents reported in 1987
than the previous year, but harassment and threats also constituted
a greater percentage of 1987's total (78 percent of all episodes in
1987 as compared to 70 percent in 1986),'' it said.
   Acts of vandalism also increased: 338 in 1987, up from 191 in
1986.
   While 835 physical assaults were reported in 1987, compared with
732 in 1986, they represented a slightly smaller percentage of total
incidents: 12 percent in 1987, down from 15 percent in 1986.
   Reports of police-related incidents declined from 410 to 217.
Other declines were in reports of arson, bombings, bomb threats and
homicides.
   North Carolina had more reported incidents than any other state _
a total of 1,985, of which 1,913 were harassment or threats, the
report found. Berrill attributed this to the fact that organized
hate groups are active in the state.
   New York state led all others in the number of anti-gay
homicides, the report found. Of a total of 408 incidents reported in
New York, 20 were homicides. Sixty-four murders were reported
nationwide.
   The study also highlighted federal, state and local initiatives
to combat such violence, including passage of a hate crimes
statistics bill by the House last month. The bill would require
federal collection of statistics on crimes motivated by race,
religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.
   A companion bill has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif.

   Pope John Paul II on Tuesday established
a new Roman Catholic Diocese of Knoxville and named an Irish-born
priest as its first bishop.
   The diocese, comprised largely of rural counties, will include
Chattanooga, Johnson City and Kingsport with about 36,000 Catholics,
said Gary Honnert, director of communications for the Memphis
Diocese.
   The Vatican said the new bishopric was created from territory
taken from the Diocese of Nashville.
   Appointed bishop was the Rev. Anthony O'Connell, 50, a native of
Lisheen, County Clare, who came to the United States 30 years ago,
the Vatican said. He has been rector of St. Thomas Seminary in
Jefferson City, Mo.
   In a news conference Tuesday in Knoxville, O'Connell said the new
diocese is an answer to the prayers of Catholics in East Tennessee.
   ``I rejoice with the faithful of East Tennessee who have longed
for, prayed for and worked hard for this happy event _ the
establishment of their own diocese,'' he said. ``I know how grateful
they must feel to John Paul for his pastoral care in responding to
their pleas.''
   Honnert said the diocese in Nashville was established in 1837,
and was the state's only Roman Catholic diocese until 1971, when
Pope Paul VI established the diocese in Memphis. There are about
130,000 Roman Catholics in Tennessee.
   Bishop James D. Niedergeses of Nashville called the new diocese a
``clear witness to the growth of Catholicism in Tennessee.''

   Mayor Henry Cisneros' son, nicknamed
``miracle baby'' after developing normally despite a malformed heart
and no spleen, will help raise money for the March of Dimes, his
parents said.
   John Paul Anthony Cisneros celebrates his first birthday Friday
with a Mass and a party at Sacred Heart Catholic Church. His family
is asking for contributions to the March of Dimes Birth Defects
Foundation rather than gifts.
   ``We are looking ahead 10 to 15 years so that we can say, `Even
as a baby I helped raise money for good causes,''' said George
Cisneros, the baby's grandfather.
   The Cisneroses have been surprised by the health of the child,
born with a heart that has only two chambers, no spleen and a
malformed stomach. But he has been given medication and has grown
from under 6 pounds at birth to 18 pounds.
   The mayor and his wife, Mary Alice, are shopping for the child's
birthday present, a dog.
   ``When I get home the first thing he says to me is `Dah,' which
is for dog,'' the mayor said Monday.
   ``He points at the dogs and we make the dog bark and then we make
John Paul bark and then we all bark,'' Mrs. Cisneros said.

   Talk show host and actress Oprah Winfrey says the
three major TV networks at first rejected her idea to film the novel
``The Women of Brewster Place'' because ``they said it was too
womanish.''
   But Winfrey, who's not known for her reserve, said in the June 13
issue of People that she wouldn't take `no' for an answer. She
delivered copies of Gloria Naylor's book, which won the 1982
American Book award, to five executives at ABC.
   ``I passed them around and said, `Look, I know you are very wise
and perceptive men, and the only reason you have turned down this
project is because you haven't read the book. You could not read it
and turn it down. I'll be calling by Tuesday to see who's read it.
We're going to have a book report, fellas.'''
   By the deadline, only one executive had read the book, which
chronicles the ghetto lives of seven black women, but he was sold.
   ``We went from there,'' said Winfrey, who is the film's executive
producer as well as its star.
   The movie, which also stars Cicely Tyson, Robin Givens, Jackee
Harry and Lonette McKee, is in production at Universal Studios and
is to air next season on ABC.

   The 88-year-old Queen Mother
Elizabeth flew into Northern Ireland on Tuesday to dedicate a
restored castle near the scene of a terrorist bombing that killed 11
people last year.
   Scores of soldiers and troops patrolled 18th-century Castle Coole
as the mother of Queen Elizabeth II arrived at the 1,370-acre estate.
   Reopening the castle following a $6.3 million restoration, the
queen mother recalled the Irish Republican Army bombing of a
war-memorial service in Enniskillen, a mile away, last Nov. 8.
   ``My heart goes out, as it did then, to the families and friends
who lost their lives, and of those who are still recovering from
their injuries,'' she said.
   It was her 12th visit to the British province. The IRA is
fighting to force the British from Northern Ireland and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish
Republic.

   The final round of the primary season was considerably less than
an all-out struggle.
   Dukakis spent less than $250,000 on television in California and
nothing on TV advertising in New Jersey.
   Jackson's campaign said it was spending $700,000 in California,
but even that was a relative pittance in the state with the most
delegates of all.
   Bush, trying to avoid overshooting federal spending limitations,
had no commercials and little organizational effort. His California
office had one paid staff member and a handful of telephone lines.
   All this was in astonishing contrast to the primaries and
caucuses at the beginning of the campaign season, when Bush,
Dukakis, Jackson and their rivals of long ago lavished time and
money on states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.
   It was a marked contrast, as well, to Republican and Democratic
campaigns of the past, when the outcome of nominating struggles hung
in the balance to be tipped one way or another by the voters of
California or New Jersey.
   And even as one primary season was ending, Congress was debating
whether to make changes in the next one. A Senate committee heard
testimony during the day on legislation to establish a regional
primary system, with the states clustered into half a dozen
geographical categories.
   Thus ended a primary season that began with the clamor of more
than a dozen candidates but sorted out quickly.
   That was true particularly on the Republican side, where Bush
made short work of his five rivals even though he was very nearly an
early campaign casualty.
   The vice president finished third in the lead-off Iowa caucuses
behind Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and former television evangelist Pat
Robertson.
   But as his political obituaries were being prepared, Bush scored
a stunning victory in the New Hampshire primary followed by a solid
win in South Carolina. He parlayed these successes into a 16-state
sweep of Super Tuesday primaries on March 8. From then, it was a
casual stroll to clinching the Republican nomination.
   Ironically, just as he conquered the Republican field, Bush was
having trouble in the national polls. His standing plummeted as the
Reagan administration's controversies mounted, and in the final
weeks of primary campaigning, Bush began setting himself apart from
the president on dealings with Panama's Manuel Noriega and off-shore
oil drilling.
   He said more differences with the president would emerge. ``We'll
probably be dragged into more of these things rather than less, but
I will try to keep it that I don't go out and do something to tear
down or be negative about this president. It may not always be that
easy,'' he said.
   The Democratic nominating campaign was more turbulent, but even
so, it was essentially settled far earlier than seemed possible last
winter.
   With front-runner Gary Hart briefly sidelined by his Donna Rice
crisis, Dukakis was lumped with his rivals as one of the ``seven
dwarfs.'' The pack, even when Hart re-entered, was seemingly
overshadowed by speculation of a brokered national convention or a
draft candidate such as New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Dukakis' route to the nomination mirrored the man _ steady and
methodical. He finished third in Iowa, as did Bush, then rebounded
to capture a back-yard victory in New Hampshire.
   His Super Tuesday was considerably less so than the vice
president's, but super enough. Dukakis managed to pull out Southern
victories in Florida and Texas with less than half the vote. He won
at home in New England and in Maryland the same day.
   But he stumbled the next time out, finishing third in the
Illinois primary and was embarrassed a few days later when Jackson
trounced him in the Michigan caucuses. That was the end of his
primary disappointments.
   He then began a springtime surge through the primaries that
forced all his rivals but Jackson from the field _ and left little
or no doubt that he would be the nominee.
   Leading to the final week of the campaign, he won nine of the
last 10 primaries, often by landslide margins over his sole
remaining rival, and gradually built his delegate totals toward the
nomination.

<HEAD>Official Says Starvation Kills Almost 1,000 in Southern Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost 1,000 people have died of
starvation in a parched southern town that hasn't received relief
food for about a year, and most of the deaths occurred in recent
weeks, a Sudanese official said Tuesday.
   Sultan Pio Tem, commissioner of the eastern part of Bahr
el-Ghazal region, told reporters the victims were residents of
Aweil, northwest of the regional capital Wau. He said the victims
also included people forced into the town by fierce fighting in the
5-year-old civil war.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army holds 90 percent of the
countryside in the south. The government retains control of the
large towns and cities, and many peasants have fled to them seeking
army protection.
   Tem said the latest telegram he received from Aweil reported 786
people had died from hunger and hunger-related diseases from May 24
to June 1.
   He said 210 others perished earlier from the same causes and that
starvation deaths continue to occur there daily. He did not say how
many were dying each day.
   Tem was in Khartoum seeking relief food for the town. He said he
was to meet with Darios Beshir, Bahr el-Ghazal's regional govenor.
Tem said relief supplies had not reached Aweil since a consignment
of rice and edible oil arrived by train a year ago.
   Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi has not replied to an appeal for
food and medicine addressed to the government and to Western relief
organizations, Tem said, adding he was trying to meet with el-Mahdi
to urge him to declare Aweil a hunger area.
   El-Mahdi has announced that the United Nations is sponsoring a
program to transport relief food to the south, but no date has been
set for the operation.
   The SPLA took up arms against the government in 1983 to demand
more autonomy and administrative and economic reforms. The years of
fighting have corresponded with one of the worst famines in Sudan in
years.

   Former Vice President Walter Mondale on Tuesday
urged Congress to order a system of regional presidential primaries
to replace a hodgepodge that ``cries out for reform.''
   Mondale, who won the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984
but lost the general election to President Reagan, testified in
support of a bill that would require such regional primaries, with
the dates to be decided by the Federal Election Commission.
   It would also outlaw inter-party crossover voting in primaries.
   The measure is sponsored by Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., though he
told the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration that the bill
``is not my brainchild.'' He noted that similar legislation was
introduced by then-Sen. Mondale of Minnesota in 1974.
   Mondale, testifying on the final day of the 1988 campaign season,
said the present nominating system ``is the hodgepodge result of a
decades-long accretion of rules and amendments by the conventions
and national committees of the two political parties.''
   He said primaries in widely scattered parts of the nation on the
same day, such as Tuesday's schedule of contests in New Jersey,
California, Montana and New Mexico, make it impossible for
candidates to address the issues and meet the voters.
   He urged the panel to support the bill, which would allow states
to decide on a caucus or primary form of election but would require
them to hold the event on a specific date, based on their region.
   The six regional primaries, according to the bill, would begin on
the last Tuesday in March and end on the second Tuesday in June. The
FEC would decide the order, by lots, each year.
   Mondale, drawing on his own experience, also criticized the
influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the
first-in-the-nation caucus and primary, respectively.
   In comments to reporters after his testimony, he said, ``I lived
in New Hampshire for three years virtually. I could have gotten
elected mayor in most of those towns, the same in Iowa.''
   ``My theory is we ought to rotate those states so you do that in
other states. We never had a Southern state, a Western state. If
we're going to do that, let's circulate it.''
   Mondale said the present system is ``not all bad by any means,''
but ``nevertheless cries out for reform.'' He called on Congress to
act now rather than drop the issue until the next
presidential-election year.

<HEAD>Bush Struggles to Define Race; Dukakis Benefits From Long Primary
Fight</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidential primary season was kind to
Democrat Michael Dukakis but disquieting to Republican George Bush,
who struggles to define the race in his terms despite clinching the
nomination two months ago.
   The primary election results and the current polls could be
likened to the electorate's first impressions of the candidates,
impressions likely to change as they get to know the contenders
better in the fall.
   Right now, Dukakis is riding a wave of public desire for change.
After nearly eight years of Ronald Reagan, the public may be looking
for something different, a change of direction.
   Democratic and Republican pollsters alike report Americans are
uneasy with the economy and concerned that the country is headed in
the wrong direction.
   Bush is suffering from an inability to define the race in his
terms. Peace and prosperity is a theme that has worked well for
Republicans in the past, but, so far, Bush hasn't been able to
convince voters that it applies today.
   ``I can't wait for this primary season to end,'' the vice
president tells rallies.
   From the Bush viewpoint, Dukakis has had the best of all worlds
the past three months.
   The contest for the Republican presidential nomination
effectively ended on March 8, Super Tuesday, when Bush swept 16
primaries and sent Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas staggering back to the
Midwest in search of a miracle. Any lingering doubts about the
outcome ended a week later with another Bush landslide in Illinois;
he mathematically locked up the nomination in Pennsylvania on April
26.
   The GOP race was over, a footnote to news accounts of the
struggle among the Democrats.
   Dukakis ran poorly in Illinois where the big Democratic winners
were two home state favorites, Sen. Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson.
   When the scene shifted to Michigan, things looked even worse for
the Massachusetts governor. He was beaten again, this time by
Jackson.
   ``Where's Mario?'' came the cry from Democrats nervously looking
for a winner. But Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York preferred the role of
kibitzer to that of candidate.
   The nervousness among Democrats proved unfounded. When the
contest came down to a choice between Dukakis and Jackson, the
Massachusetts governor ran off with a string of victories.
   Nearly every Wednesday morning for two months, Americans learned
of yet another Dukakis victory. As one Republican strategist put it:
``With every victory he grew another inch.''
   The Bush campaign chafed under another reality of the Democratic
race: In a Dukakis-Jackson contest, the Massachusetts governor came
off as the moderate.
   Bush lamented that one national poll found two-thirds of the
respondents considered Dukakis more conservative than the vice
president.
   ``There's something weird about that,'' said Bush.
   There also is the prospect that things will get worse for Bush
before they get better.
   The Democratic convention is in July, and if Dukakis succeeds in
resolving some potential pitfalls and presents a festival of unity
for four days on national television, he is almost certain to get
another boost in the polls.
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater concedes that the vice
president could be trailing by as much as 20 points in surveys
before the Republican convention in August.
   But before Dukakis can send out invitations to his inauguration,
he has some problems to resolve.
   The biggest one is Jackson.
   The former civil rights leader has a hold on the Democratic
Party's most loyal constituency and many of his followers think
Jackson must be offered the vice presidential nomination _ an offer
Dukakis isn't likely to make unless he is certain it would be turned
down.
   Jackson also is threatening to wage convention fights for
platform planks he favors.
   There are no foreseeable conflicts for the GOP convention,
allowing Bush to gain maximum benefits from the GOP coronation.
   And as Bush reads the current polls showing him trailing Dukakis,
he also can take comfort in the fact that when voters start focusing
on presidential campaigns in the fall, the race inevitably tightens,
often dramatically.

<HEAD>Japan Most Often On Governors' Overseas Itineraries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When governors pack their bags and passports,
where do they go?
   In 1987, they headed most often to Japan, according to a survey
by the National Governors Association.
   It said governors from 43 states and territories made 87 overseas
trips during 1987, often stopping in more than one country.
   But the most frequent destination was Japan (36 trips), followed
by Korea (19), Taiwan and England (both 17), West Germany (13),
China and France (both 9), Canada, Italy and Hong Kong (all 6), and
Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands (all 3).
   Honduras, Panama and the Soviet Union were each visited twice.
   Countries that drew a single governor were: Anguilla, Australia,
Austria, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, Ireland, India, Israel,
Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, New Caledonia, Saipan, St. Lucia,
Sweden, Thailand, Venezuela and Western Samoa.
   The association said governors usually go abroad to encourage
U.S. exports, increase foreign investment and promote tourism.
   The 87 trips was nearly double the 45 overseas trips governors
made in 1986.
   ``Nowadays, most governors are making one to five overseas trips
a year to sell their states' resources, goods and services,''
according to an article in the Governors' Weekly Bulletin.

<HEAD>Seven States Hold Primaries, With Four Senate Races on Ballot</HEAD>

   California voters Tuesday decided whether to shut down a nuclear
plant and permit the quarantining of AIDS victims, while two Newark
councilmen vied for a chance to become New Jersey's first black
congressman.
   Four U.S. Senate races also were on the ballots as seven states
held primaries, and Montana had a wide-open race for governor,
highlighted by former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge's comeback bid.
   The liveliest Senate primary was in New Mexico, where polls
showed state Sen. Bill Valentine leading three fellow Republicans
for the nomination to oppose first-term Democratic Sen. Jeff
Bingaman.
   Three other Senate primaries were all Democratic skirmishes
leading to the main event in November. First-term Sen. Frank
Lautenberg of New Jersey had two little-known opponents as he sought
to defend his seat against Republican Peter Dawkins; Montana Sen.
John Melcher had one challenger in his bid for a third term against
Republican Conrad Burns, and California Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy was
favored over three rivals to win a chance to face Republican Sen.
Pete Wilson.
   In Newark's heavily Democratic 10th district, where Rep. Peter
Rodino was retiring after 40 years, black City Councilmen Donald
Payne and Ralph Grant competed in the Democratic primary. The winner
was expected to defeat the GOP nominee, political newcomer Michael
Webb, who also is black.
   In Montana, Judge was one of six Democrats who entered the race
for governor after Democrat Ted Schwinden decided not to seek a
third term. Former state Sen. Stan Stephens and state Rep. Cal
Winslow were the only Republican candidates left after the early
favorite, Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, was killed in a plane
crash in April.
   San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor was seeking a full four-year
term and needed a majority in the non-partisan primary to avoid a
runoff in the nation's seventh-largest city.
   Californians confronted their usual slew of ballot measures,
including proposals to ease state spending limits, curb campaign
spending, slow growth and declare AIDS a communicable disease,
subjecting victims to potential quarantine.
   In Sacramento County, a measure seeking closure of the Rancho
Seco nuclear power plant could mark the first time in history that
voters have directly ordered the shutdown of such a facility.
   And in San Bernardino County, geographically the nation's
largest, voters were asked to carve away the eastern, desert portion
to create a new jurisdiction called Mojave County.
   Here are highlights of voting in the other states:
   ALABAMA _ Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy, a son-in-law of former Gov.
George C. Wallace, was running for the Democratic nomination to
state Supreme Court on a slate supported by trial lawyers and
opposed by big business and insurance companies.
   IOWA _ Sixteen supporters of extremist Lyndon LaRouche were
running in Democratic primaries, five for congressional nominations
and the rest in state legislative districts.
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ No statewide races were on the ballot and there
were only 26 primary races for the 105 state Senate and House seats.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In the Senate races, the national GOP has hopes of unseating both
Bingaman and Lautenberg. New Mexico Republicans have portrayed
Bingaman as too liberal for a state that has long supported heavy
defense spending. In New Jersey, Dawkins, a Heisman trophy winner,
Rhodes scholar and Vietnam War hero, moved to the Garden State to
enter the race and based his early campaigning mainly on his
impressive resume.
   Both states have Republican governors who will campaign for the
GOP Senate candidates.
   California's Wilson has been far ahead of McCarthy in
fund-raising and the polls. His biggest obstacle appears to be a
jinx on his Senate seat which has prevented any occupant from
winning re-election in more than 30 years.
   Burns, the Republican nominee in Montana, is a commissioner in
Yellowstone County who has yet to achieve much statewide
recognition. A Minnesota man withdrew from the GOP race too late for
his name to be taken off the ballot.
   Schwinden's retirement after two terms in Montana left the
governorship without a Democratic incumbent on the ballot for the
first time in 20 years. Schwinden had defeated Judge in the primary
in 1980.
   Rodino, the House Judiciary chairman who led the impeachment
hearings against former President Nixon, is stepping down amid
growing sentiment that his predominantly black district should be
represented by a black. He made no endorsement in the primary.
   The AIDS measure, sponsored by LaRouche supporters, was opposed
by the California Medical Association and the leadership of both
major parties. It was almost identical to a plan defeated by a 2-1
margin in 1986.

<HEAD>Kitty Dukakis to Leave Hospital Less than a Week After Surgery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis plans to leave Massachusetts General
Hospital on Thursday, less than a week after undergoing neck surgery
to eliminate a condition that could have caused paralysis.
   The wife of Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
said Tuesday in a telephone interview that doctors at the hospital
told her she could leave later this week.
   ``My neck is fine. I'm walking without help. I have just a little
pain in my hip,'' Mrs. Dukakis said. Her hip pain is the result of
Friday's surgery in which doctors removed two small bone fragments
and used them to replace two herniated discs in her neck.
   Mrs. Dukakis was alert and sitting up in bed, but sounded
slightly hoarse in the interview.
   She said she longed to be with her husband for Tuesday's
California primary, the last event in the long pre-convention
season. ``I wish I was somewhere else,'' she said shortly after
speaking to her husband at 6:30 a.m., California time. ``He sounded
a little weary.''
   In the meantime, Mrs. Dukakis sorted through piles of gifts and
cards and walked the hallways of the hospital, visiting other
patients.
   She said she received ``lots of candy, fruit and flowers'' from
friends, relatives and some of her husband's Democratic rivals, but
nothing, so far, from President Reagan or the certain Republican
nominee, Vice President George Bush.
   Doctors have prescribed rest at home for Mrs. Dukakis when she
leaves the hospital and a curtailed campaign schedule until the
Democratic National Convention, which opens July 18 in Atlanta.
   Dr. Nicholas T. Zervas, chief of neurology at the hospital, told
Mrs. Dukakis that she would have to wear a neck brace for, at most,
eight weeks _ a period that could include the convention.
   ``If I have to, big deal,'' she said of the possibility of
joining her husband at the podium in a brace.
   Doctors plan to take X-rays next month to make sure her neck is
healing properly, she said.
   Zervas, a longtime family friend, led a team of surgeons in the
operation on the 51-year-old Mrs. Dukakis. Doctors said that if the
ailment had gone undetected much longer, she faced the risk of
paralysis.
   Mrs. Dukakis said she began to feel the warnings signs that
something was wrong a month before she was diagnosed last week.
   ``I didn't have much time to think about it,'' she said. ``One
tends to slough things off in a campaign atmosphere.''
   Early in Dukakis' presidential campaign, Mrs. Dukakis
acknowledged that she had kicked an addiction to diet pills that had
lasted more than two decades. She said Tuesday she is trying to
limit the number of pain killers she takes to help her through her
recovery.

<HEAD>Pepper Rallies His Forces for Floor Fight on Long-Term Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Claude Pepper marshaled an array of
influential lawmakers Tuesday as he prepared for a do-or-die effort
in the House to pass a costly new home health care program.
   Pepper's plan, scheduled for floor action Wednesday, would expand
Medicare to include long-term home care benefits for anyone of any
age who is chronically ill or can't perform tasks of daily living.
   With opponents mobilizing to prevent a vote on the bill, Pepper
rallied his own forces Tuesday at a news conference: Sens. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee; Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., the Senate sponsor of the bill;
and Reps. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who holds the No. 4 leadership
position in the House; and Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee.
   ``We have a total vacuum'' when it comes to long-term care,''
Pepper, D-Fla., said. ``A million people a year become destitute
trying to pay for catastrophic care.''
   The Pepper bill has provoked criticism on several counts, among
them its high cost, its lack of a nursing home component and the
unorthodox manner in which it bypassed committee scrutiny and sped
to the House floor.
   ``We should not allow the rules of the House to be manipulated to
satisfy the popular issue of the moment,'' House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Tuesday in a
letter to his colleagues. He said the committee system ``protects
members from being forced to vote on popular-appearing proposals
that may ultimately prove to be embarrassing.''
   The Pepper bill is putting House members, particularly Democrats,
in a bind because withiout their support there is no chance Congress
will pass the bill before adjourning this year.
   There is overwhelming public sentiment in favor of a long-term
care program. There also is an election in six months, and the
87-year-old Pepper, who is popular with elderly voters, has made
campaign appearances on behalf of many lawmakers in the past.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the home care program
would cost nearly $28 billion over five years. It would be paid for
by imposing the Medicare payroll tax on income above $45,000, which
is currently exempt.
   Supporters of the plan also backed a new catastrophic care
benefit bill to help the elderly cope with acute illness. That
Medicare expansion, more than a year in the making, has passed the
House and is expected to pass the Senate this week.
   But Waxman called that measure ``only half the roof that people
need to shield them from health care catastrophes. ... I always feel
guilty calling this other bill the catastrophic bill.''
   Pepper initially tried to attach his plan to the catastrophic
bill, but withdrew it when lawmakers said it would sink that
legislation. In return, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, agreed to
let Pepper have a separate floor vote on his plan.
   Pepper, chairman of the rules committee that schedules floor
action, scheduled his own bill last year, effectively bypassing
Rostenkowski's committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee
headed by John Dingell, D-Mich., which ordinarily would have
considered the Pepper bill.
   Rostenkowski complained in his ``Dear Colleague'' letter that the
bill was brought to the floor via ``an extremely unusual and
troubling procedure.''
   He also said the agencies necessary to administer the Pepper plan
do not exist and ``history has demonstrated that such a big program
cannot be put in place quickly without encouraging inept or
fraudulent management.'' And he said CBO estimates show the program
would face an annual deficit within five years.
   Pepper dismissed the notion that he was abusing the committee
process, saying what happened with his bill was unique and would not
become routine.
   ``The rules committee is not going to run rampant over anybody,''
Pepper said Tuesday. ``All they want to do is kill the bill and use
the money for something else.''
   In a ``Dear Colleague'' letter of their own, dated June 8, Pepper
and his co-sponsor, Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., called cost and
procedure issues ``bogus'' reasons to oppose the bill.
   They said the bill contains a cap on costs and does not violate
any procedural rules of the House.
   They also said outside opposition groups such as the insurance
industry would oppose any long-term care bill because ``they serve
their own narrow self-interest, not the American people's interest.''

<HEAD>Eight Killed in Widespread Violence on Second Day of Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Widespread violence and eight
deaths were reported Tuesday, the second day of a nationwide general
strike that organizers claimed involved 2.5 million people.
   Employers and transport companies said support for the strike had
dwindled and that more workers were on the job in many areas.
   In Durban, however, the Federated Chamber of Industries said the
strike had intensified around the nation's third-largest city.
   Black labor unions and anti-apartheid groups called the three-day
protest, which the government says is illegal, to oppose the
2-year-old state of emergency and proposed legislation to restrict
the rights of unions to strike.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest black
labor federation, said at least 2.5 million people were staying away
from jobs and schools. It called the strike the most significant to
date.
   General secretary Jay Naidoo denied government claims that the
protest was being sustained by intimidation.
   He told reporters the strike was ``a reflection of the wide-scale
resentment and anger'' about orders issued in February that barred
his organization and other anti-apartheid groups from political
activity.
   President P.W. Botha's government imposed the emergency June 12,
1986, to combat a black uprising against apartheid, the policy of
race discrimination that preserves privilege for South Africa's 5
million whites and denies the 26 million blacks a voice in national
affairs.
   In Lusaka, Zambia, the exile headquarters of the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement declared ``unequivocal
support'' for the strike. The ANC is the main group fighting white
domination in South Africa.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said:
``The strike appears to enjoy the overwhelming support of the
disenfranchised majority in South Africa and has so far been
peaceful.
   ``We hope all parties will continue to avoid violence. The strike
underscores the urgent need for negotiations among South Africans to
replace apartheid with a democratic constitutional order.''
   The three-day strike is the largest black protest under the
emergency.
   A report by state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said
participation declined by 45 percent Tuesday but gave no estimate of
the number of people involved. It said in an editorial that the
strike represented the strategy of ``radical activists who want to
make South Africa ungovernable.''
   Police would not comment on the scope of the protest because,
they said, emergency regulations prohibit such reports. Headquarters
advised local news media to consult lawyers before publishing
stories about the strike.
   Authorities reported more than two dozen incidents of violence
Monday night and early Tuesday, including fire-bombings and stonings
of homes, buses and trains. Twenty-one arrests and 23 injuries were
reported.
   Officers shot to death a young black when a municipal police unit
was stoned, according to police spokesmen. They said seven other
blacks, including three children, were killed in shootings, a hand
grenade attack and a fire-bombing.
   Five of the deaths occurred near Durban. There was an unconfirmed
report of four more killings there.
   The protest has aggravated a feud in the area between black
militants and more conservative blacks who support Zulu leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, an opponent of strikes and other
confrontational tactics.
   The mining industry, which produces 80 percent of South Africa's
export earnings, has been only slightly affected by the strike.
   Only one gold mine reported significant absenteeism. The National
Mineworkers Union and mine owners gave conflicting reports of strike
action at diamond and coal mines, but the union conceded effects
were limited.
   All seven major auto assembly plants were closed.
   According to PUTCO, a private bus company that carries 300,000
black commuters daily, ridership from Johannesburg's huge black
township of Soweto increased from 10 percent of normal Monday to 25
percent Tuesday.
   It said traffic was near normal in Pretoria but remained at 10
percent around Durban. The state-run South African Transport
Services said rail commuter traffic had increased dramatically in
most areas.
   In some black areas around Johannesburg where transport was
disrupted, police used trucks to carry people to the nearest
functioning bus routes.
   Schools remained empty in Soweto and other black townships. Many
students are expected to extend a scheduled vacation period that
begins Monday by staying home the rest of this week.
   The Star of Johannesburg, the country's largest daily newspaper,
said in an editorial: ``There will be no winners in this
ill-considered clash. The country will never know how many who
stayed away did so out of political conviction, how many out of fear
of retribution or simply the chance of a day off.''

   Question: Is 26.9 percent ``fully a third''?
   The correct answer is no, but 26.9 percent is described as
equaling a third in a foreword to the federal mathematics study
released Tuesday by the National Assessment of Educational Progress.
   Gregory Anrig, president of the Educational Testing Service,
which runs the government-sponsored testing program, wrote in a
preface that, ``Fully a third of our 13-year-olds haven't mastered
skills universally taught in elementary school.''
   The executive summary of the report also said it was ``alarming
that one-third of these students'' didn't score 250 on the 500-point
test, a level indicating they can perform basic operations and begin
to solve problems.
   But a chart accompanying the test indicated that in 1986, 73.1
percent of the 13-year-olds actually reached that level, up from
64.9 percent in 1978.
   The full text of the report, ``The Mathematics Report Card: Are
We Measuring Up,'' referring to the same statistics, says: ``It is
alarming that one-quarter of the seventh and eighth graders _
amounting to more than three-quarters of a million students _ may
not possess the skills ... necessary to perform many everyday
tasks.''
   Kent Ashworth, a spokesman for the National Assessment,
acknowledged that ``fully a third'' was a mistake, and expressed
surprise that it had gotten past the report's proofreaders.

<HEAD>Publisher Pays Record Sum for `Gone With the Wind' Sequel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French editor paid a record $1 million for the
rights to publish the French version of the sequel to the American
classic ``Gone With the Wind,'' the editing company said Tuesday.
   Pierre Belfond of Editions Belfond said it was the largest sum
ever paid for translation rights by a French publisher.
   In the United States, Warner Books is paying novelist Alexandra
Ripley nearly $5 million to write the sequel to Margaret Mitchell's
only novel. The sequel, which has yet to be named, is to be released
in 1990, said Warner spokeswoman Theresa Wiltz in New York.
   The French firm outbid six others in an auction last week to
acquire the rights from the William Morris Co. of New York, which
controls overseas rights to the book, Belfond said.
   Mitchell's novel, enormously successful when it was published in
1936, was the basis for the film classic starring Clark Gable as
Rhett Butler and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara.
   Belfond has published translations of other best-selling American
novels, including Jacqueline Susann's ``Valley of the Dolls.''
   French publisher Gallimard, which raked in millions with the
translation of ``Autant en Emporte le Vent'' (``Gone With the
Wind'') when it was published here in 1939, did not take part in
negotiations for the sequel.
   A Gallimard spokesman said $1 million was ``an exhorbitant amount
to pay for a doubtful return.''
   Belfond acknowledged the purchase was a gamble. The French
edition is expected to be on bookstore shelves by the end of 1990.

<HEAD>Legislation Seeks Tighter Regulation of Medical Labs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical testing labs would come under strict
federal regulation under a bill introduced Tuesday by Sens. Carl
Levin, D-Mich., and William Cohen, R-Maine.
   The bill would affect the 80,000 to 100,000 medical laboratories
not now under federal regulation. Most are in doctors' offices,
Levin said.
   ``Our legislation changes the focus of lab testing to emphasize
quality over quantity,'' said Levin. ``That difference can have
life-or-death consequences.''
   The legislation would establish maximum workload limits for lab
workers who examine Pap smears, strengthen federal enforcement
authority over labs and set standards for the laboratories.
   ``From the patient's point of view, there should be just as much
assurance that tests conducted in a doctor's office are as
accurate'' as those conducted in a hospital or commercial lab, Levin
said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Tuesday to
make U.S. laws comply with a recent fisheries treaty governing
tuna-rich waters of the South Pacific, saying the pact ``will set a
tone of cooperation rather than confrontation.''
   The treaty provides for U.S. fishermen to purchase regional
licenses to fish for tuna in some 10 million square miles of the
South Pacific Ocean.
   ``It will set to rest the fisheries-related problems we have
experienced stemming from our differing judicial positions
concerning highly migratory species of tuna,'' Reagan said.
   The president also said that license fees and a related economic
assistance agreement ``will further the economic development and
strengthen the democratic traditions of the Pacific Island states
participating in the treaty.''
   ``The treaty is historic in both its complexity and scope and
culminates over two years of difficult negotiations,'' Reagan said.
``Its successful implementation will set a tone of cooperation
rather than confrontation in our fisheries relations with 15 island
nations of the South Pacific.''

<HEAD>Federal Appeals Court Upholds Agency's Lowering of CAFE Standard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration acted reasonably in lowering mandatory fuel economy
standards to 26 miles per gallon, a federal appeals court ruled,
2-1, Tuesday.
   NHTSA lowered the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE,
standard automakers must meet in 1986 from the 27.5 mpg set by
Congress to 26 mpg, asserting the higher standard was not
economically practical.
   The state of California, the cities of Los Angeles and New York
and four citizens groups, led by Washington-based Public Citizen,
filed petitions requesting a court review of the order.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
in an opinion by Judge Ruth Ginsburg, said NHTSA's ``consideration
of the likelihood of economic hardship within its assessment of
`economic practicability' must be given due weight.''
   The agency's decision was based on analysis that concluded the
higher standard would have severe economic effects throughout the
auto industry, and therefore was not arbitrary or capricious as the
petitioners had charged, the court said.
   The petitioners also asserted that NHTSA, by lowering the
standard, had failed to consider the nation's need to conserve
energy. The CAFE standards were initially adopted in the 1970s to
reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
   The court, however, said the agency had weighed increased fuel
consumption against economic harm under broad guidelines set by
Congress.
   ``Had Congress offered a more precise balancing formula for the
agency to apply, ... we could more confidently discern the agency's
compliance with the congressional mandate,'' the court said.
   In the absence of such precision, the court said it must conclude
NHTSA had properly accomodated conflicting policies in lowering the
standard.
   Mrs. Ginsbug was joined in the majority by Judge Abner Mikva.
Judge Lawrence Silberman dissented.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley has called for repeal of the
CAFE standards, saying in an era of cheaper energy they have
outlived their usefulness and harm the U.S. auto industry's
competitiveness.
   Supporters of the standards argue they must be retained to keep
the nation from again slipping into deep dependence on unreliable
foreign sources of oil.
   Besides NHTSA, the petitions named Ford Motor Co., the Automobile
Importers of America Inc. and General Motors Corp. as defendants.

<TEXT>
   The Parliament passed a constitutional
amendment Tuesday making Islam the state religion. Thousands of
opponents took to the streets in protest, blocking traffic and
damaging vehicles.
   The 300-member Parliament, dominated by President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad's Jatiya Party, passed the controversial bill 254-0.
Fifteen members of minor opposition parties walked out before the
vote. Two independents joined the Jatiya Party to enact the bill,
which was proposed May 11.
   The amendment makes an Islamic republic out of this once-secular
state created after a 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.
   Shortly after the legislation was passed, several thousand
members of 21 non-voting opposition groups streamed into the
streets. These parties have no representatives in Parliament because
they boycotted March elections in which Ershad won a 252-seat
parliamentary majority.
   Witnesses said the mobs stopped traffic at several intersections
in downtown Dhaka and damaged seven state-run buses and a police
jeep.
   Riot police were on duty, but no clashes were reported.
   The proposed bill drew especially strong criticism from women's
groups, opposition parties and minority religions in a country whose
105 million people are 85 percent Moslem. There are an estimated
250,000 Christians in Bangladesh, as well as Hindu and Buddhist
minorities.
   The bill amends the Bangladesh Constitution to insert the
sentence: ``The religion of the republic is Islam, but other
religions may be practiced in peace and harmony.'' The government
says the bill does not change the legal system to one that would
follow the Koran, the Moslem holy book.
   Women's rights groups, however, fear that Moslem fundamentalists
may use the amendment to pressure the state to pass more rigid laws
following Islamic traditions, such as those requiring women to hide
their faces behind veils.
   But observers say there is little possibility that the amendment
would pull Bangladesh into a social system resembling the Islamic
fundamentalism of Iran.
   About 3,000 demonstrators _ including teachers, journalists and
doctors _ marched through the streets of Dhaka on Saturday to
protest the change, shouting anti-government slogans.
   Christian leaders had appealed to Ershad to withdraw the
legislation.
   Among those who signed the statement was the Rev. Michael
Rozario, the Roman Catholic archibishop of Dhaka, and
representatives of other Christian denominations.
   Before the legislation was passed, Prime Minister Maudud Ahmed
assured minority groups that they should not fear the amendment and
told the Parliament that the bill was ``to free Islam from the hands
of fundamentalists and the traders of religion.''
   But political analysts in Dhaka have said they believe Ershad's
main reason for launching Islam as the official religion was to woo
Islamic fundamentalists, some of whom are campaigning against his
regime for being too lax in supporting Moslem traditions.
   Ershad, a former army general, came to power in a bloodless coup
in March 1982 and was elected president in October 1986. The major
opposition groups contend the elections were rigged.
   They boycotted the March elections, saying they also would be
rigged, and vowed not to participate in elections until Ershad
leaves office.

   The New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union said
Tuesday it will help with an appeal on behalf of a 9-year-old boy
and his parents, who refuse to medicate him to control his
hyperactivity in school.
   The group agreed to assist Casey Jesson's lawyer in appealing a
state hearing officer's decision that the boy must take Ritalin or
an alternative drug to calm hyperactive children if he continues to
attend regular public school classes next year.
   School officials in Derry said Casey was manageable on Ritalin
and that without it he has temper tantrums and is disruptive.
   His parents, Valerie and Michael, said Ritalin made Casey act
like a drug addict with facial twitches, little appetite and
insomnia. They stopped giving him Ritalin in April 1987 after he
spent 18 months on the drug.
   The appeal likely will be filed in federal court, where precedent
exists for such matters, Claire Ebel, the CLU's executive director,
said Tuesday.
   The first line of defense will be to assert Casey's
constitutional right to privacy when medical treatment is involved,
she said.
   ``For any government agency, such as the state Education
Department, to violate that privacy, there must exist a compelling
state interest and we don't believe that has been proven,'' she said.
   The group's lawyers also believe Casey's rights as an
educationally handicapped child have been violated, Ebel said.
   Hearing officer Eric Falkenham ruled last month that returning
Casey to class without medication would harm his education and that
of his classmates.
   Falkehham also said the Jessons would have to pay to have Casey
placed in a more restrictive, specialized class if they refuse to
medicate him.
   In an agreement between the state and Casey's parents, he is
being tutored until the school year ends later this month.

   Leaders of the nation's public and non-profit
employee organizations joined with legislators Tuesday to denounce
an Internal Revenue Service proposal that would tax such benefits as
vacation pay and sick leave, even if they are not used.
   ``The IRS decision is baffling and at some real level inhumane,''
Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., said at a news conference. ``The
moment you start taxing sick leave that is not used, people start
using sick leave.''
   William L. McGowan, president of the Civil Service Employees
Association of New York State, the state's largest public employee
union, echoed the senator's objections.
   ``Whoever's doing the thinking on this isn't thinking very
clearly,'' he said.
   McGowan estimated that if his union's 250,000 members used all
their sick time and vacation leave every year, it would be the
equivalent of an 18 percent cutback in the workforce.
   The proposal at issue was put forward by the IRS in January 1987
to change a section of the Internal Revenue Code.
   The IRS issued a public notice that Section 457 _ which provides
rules for certain types of deferred compensation for employees of
state and local governments and tax-exempt organizations _ would be
interpreted to apply to ``nonelective'' deferred compensation. This
would include such benefits as vacation pay, sick leave,
compensatory time, severance pay, disability and death benefit plans.
   Until that announcement, public and non-profit employers had
generally understood the restrictions of Section 457 to apply only
to elective deferred compensation, or salary that an employee
postpones receiving, Moynihan explained.
   Moynihan introduced legislation Tuesday to amend the Internal
Revenue Code to clarify that Section 457 would not apply to
nonelective deferred compensation.
   At the same time, however, he conceded that the bill has little
chance of passing this year because Congress is not slated to
address a major tax bill.
   He also wrote last week to Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III,
urging that the IRS reconsider its position so the matter can be
resolved without legislation.

<TEXT>
   The drought that has gripped north Georgia is
causing a new kind of battle among lawn-conscious suburbanites, some
of whom are reporting their neighbors for ignoring tight
restrictions on outdoor water use.
   Fulton County's Public Works Department has been swamped with
water calls, said operator Evelyn Smith, who estimated that 90
percent of the department's recent calls have been about outdoor
watering.
   ``They say, `Their lawn's so pretty and green, how come they get
to water and I don't,''' she said.
   ``They're calling in on their neighbors, basically,'' said Cobb
County Police radio operator Nina Reber.
   ``Some are pretty mad,'' said Gus Monroe, deputy director of
DeKalb County's Water Department. ``Some just want to complain. Lots
are just teed off at their neighbors.''
   Gwinnett County Water Department Director Gary Beaufait said his
department received nearly 230 calls over the weekend. ``When a
resident sees somebody else watering, I would imagine he would be
irritated,'' Beaufait said.
   Almost every government in the Atlanta area has restrictions on
when lawns can be watered and cars washed.
   The city of Roswell, in northern Fulton County, announced that it
would ban outdoor watering 24 hours a day beginning at midnight
Tuesday.
   Atlanta has banned outdoor watering from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. since
November, and its water bureau is recommending that residents use
water outdoors on odd or even days, depending on their address.
   Despite the bans, faucets in about 1,000 north Fulton County
homes went dry from about 9 p.m. Monday until 1 a.m. Tuesday, said
county water supervisor Hershel Barrett. He said the area, which
bans outdoor watering from noon until 9 p.m., ran out of water
because many residents ``just dragged out the water hoses and went
to town'' when the ban expired Monday night.
   ``We were, for all practical purposes, out of water last night,''
he said Tuesday.
   About 200 homes in southern Forsyth County, where water was
purchased from Fulton County, also lost water for three to four
hours Monday night, said Forsyth water department director Tom Heard.
   Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer said there have been
only 210 inches of rain in most parts of north Georgia in the last
five years. The region averages 50 inches of rainfall per year, or
250 inches in five years.
   Lake Lanier, the metropolitan area's primary water source, was at
1,062.7 feet above sea level Tuesday, 10 feet above its record low
of 1,052.7 feet, set Dec. 24, 1981.
   ``All indications are that this is going to be a very critical
drought in the northern part of the state,'' said David Word, chief
of water resource management for the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources. ``It is going to be worse than '86.''
   However, Word said the driest weather this year is confined to
north Georgia, unlike the statewide drought in 1986.
   The water situation in the northeast Georgia town of Clayton _
which was without water for 36 hours during the summer of 1986 _
will be critical if the town doesn't receive significant rainfall
soon, Mayor Tom Ramey said Tuesday.
   But Ramey said the experience of running out of water taught
residents the importance of conservation.
   ``It was a lesson well learned, because when they turned that tap
on and nothing came out they knew we weren't fooling,'' he said.

   New Mexico Republicans chose from among
four candidates Tuesday to try to unseat first-term Democratic Sen.
Jeff Bingaman.
   State Sens. Bill Valentine and Joe Carraro, party activist Corky
Morris and former U.S. Interior Department official Rick Montoya
each argued that he was the right candidate to mount a successful
challenge to the man Republicans believe is too liberal for New
Mexico.
   In the presidential primary, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
was favored over Jesse Jackson in the race for 24 Democratic
delegates. Vice President George Bush was unopposed for 26
Republican delegates.
   In the state's 1st Congressional District, Republican Rep. Manuel
Lujan Jr. was retiring after 20 years. Three Republicans sought the
nomination, including Lujan's younger brother Edward, the former
state GOP chairman. Eight Democrats sought their party's nomination,
including former state Land Commissioner Jim Baca.

   Bingaman, 44, was unopposed in the Democratic primary, but he
said in January when he announced for re-election that as one of
only two first-term Democrats running this year _ the other is New
Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg _ he expected his race to be targeted
by the national Republican Party.
   A former New Mexico attorney general, Bingaman was elected to the
Senate in 1982 when he defeated first-term Republican Sen. Harrison
``Jack'' Schmitt, a former astronaut.
   Valentine, 44, the first Republican to announce his candidacy,
stressed his track record of 12 years in the state Senate.
   Carraro, 43, was the last to jump into the race, waiting until
early this year.
   Morris, 52, stressed his experience in business and as a former
Bernalillo County commissioner and cited his work as state chairman
of the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984.
   Montoya, 41, said he was the only Republican who knew the ropes
in Washington. He left the Reagan administration as assistant
secretary of interior for terriorities and international affairs to
seek elective office.
   A poll published in the Albuquerque Journal on Sunday showed
Valentine the choice of 29.5 percent, with 38.9 percent undecided.

   The Unit 2 reactor at Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant automatically shut down Monday afternoon for the third time
since it was restarted last month, said a Tennessee Valley Authority
official.
   The reason for the 2:15 p.m. EDT shutdown was not immediately
known, said Janice Brady, a spokeswoman for Plant Manager Steve
Smith.
   It occurred less than a week after the reactor reached 100
percent power for the first time since it was restarted following a
33-month shutdown.
   TVA brought Unit 2 back on line May 13, the agency's first
reactor to be restarted since its nuclear system was shut down in
August 1985 to correct safety and management problems.
   Although two automatic shutdowns delayed the restart process,
Unit 2 at the plant outside Chattanooga reached full generating
capacity May 31.
   Sequoyah Unit 2 began commercial operation in June 1982; the
following year, it set a TVA record by operating 195 consecutive
days without a shutdown. That record was later broken by a 197-day
streak by Unit 1 in 1984 and 1985.
   TVA tentatively plans to restart Sequoyah Unit 1 in August or
September, with Unit 2 at the three-reactor Browns Ferry Nuclear
Plant near Athens, Ala., to follow by the end of the year.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans increased their installment borrowing
at a moderate annual rate of 7 percent in April as growth in
consumer credit slowed from the first three months of the year, the
government said Tuesday.
   The Federal Reserve Board said consumers took out $3.65 billion
more in credit than they paid off in April, compared with net growth
of $5.2 billion in March, $5.0 billion in February and $6.2 billion
in January.
   The annual rate of growth in April was slightly slower than the
7.2 percent rate for all of 1987 and considerably slower than the
approximately 10.7 percent pace for the first quarter of 1988.
   However, economists saw the slowing as a healthy trend at a time
when U.S. manufacturers are trying to boost their production for
export.
   ``What's happened is what should be happening. Consumer spending
is cooling off and freeing up resources to produce for export,''
said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a
Washington consulting firm.
   ``The whole transition from a consumer-led economy to an
export-led economy assumes we can cool off consumer demand in order
to avoid heated up inflation,'' she said.
   She said consumer debt grew faster than the norm in the
January-March period because of a surge in auto sales.
   In April, auto loans grew by $1.55 billion, a yearly growth rate
of 6.7 percent, compared with a rate of 15.9 percent in March and
14.5 percent in February.
   The category that includes credit card debt showed the strongest
increase in April _ $1.61 billion for an 11.7 percent expansion
pace, compared with 16 percent in March and 10.3 percent in February.
   The credit report said the category that includes bank and credit
union loans not secured by real estate increased by $478 million in
April, a 3.6 percent jump compared with a 3.7 percent decline a
month earlier.
   Borrowing for mobile homes increased by $13 million, 0.6 percent,
after a drop of 5.8 percent in March.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at $633.1 billion at
the end of April, up 9.1 percent from a year earlier.
   Still, Ms. Shaber said consumer borrowing as a percentage of
income has remained steady at just under 19 percent for a year and a
half.

   A government-sponsored study concluded Tuesday
that American students are doing miserably in math, and experts laid
some of the blame on the redundant, slow-paced way math is taught in
most schools.
   The National Assessment of Educational Progress reported that
almost half the 17-year-old students tested in 1985-86 proved
incapable of handling math commonly taught in junior high, and
nearly 27 percent of 13-year-olds were stumped by basic computations.
   ``Our ninth graders are taking what other peoples' seventh
graders are taking,'' Chester Finn Jr., the assistant U.S. secretary
of education for research and improvement, told a news conference.
``We've got to get it going faster, repeated less and make sure that
it's learned more.''
   The study was based on exams given to nearly 15,000 students ages
9, 13 and 17 in 1985-86, and to a total of nearly 35,000 students in
grades 3, 7 and 11. It was the fourth national assessment in math
since 1972-73.
   The study, ``The Mathematics Report Card: Are We Measuring Up,''
said all three age groups made modest improvements in recent years,
but mostly on low-order skills. Fewer were capable of advanced work
in 1986 than in 1978.
   ``Despite signs of their progress across time, the 1986
performance of 17-year-old students was dismal,'' the report said.
``Only half the high school students demonstrated an understanding
of even moderately complex mathematical procedures'' usually
introduced in junior high.
   The report said math classes are ``dominated by paper-and-pencil
drills on basic computation. Little evidence appears of any
widespread use of calculators, computers or mathematics projects.''
   More than a quarter of the 17-year-olds reported they usually do
not understand what is talked about in mathematics class.
   Math instruction is ``dominated by teacher explanations,
chalkboard presentations, and reliance on textbooks and workshops.
More innovative forms of instruction, such as ... small group
activities, laboratory work and special projects, remain
disappointingly rare.''
   ``The early emphasis on practicing computations may serve to
divorce mathematics from real-world observations,'' the report said.
``Once students learn to rely on procedures, they tend to give up on
common sense. ... This can lead to preposterous answers.''
   ``We're seeing a lot of drill and practice on obsolete skills,''
said John A. Dossey, an Illinois State University math professor.
   But the students tested in 1986 also reported getting more
homework and tests in math, and more were enrolled in advanced
courses.
   The report said 98 percent of the 9-year-olds and 100 percent of
the older students knew simple arithmetic facts, but virtually none
of the younger students and only 6.4 percent of the oldest could
solve multistep problems and algebra questions.
   Black and Hispanic students, as well as those living in the
Southeast, gained ground, but remain far behind the white majority.
   The National Assessment, administered by Educational Testing
Service, tests a sample of American students in basic subjects every
other year.
   Finn, whose department pays for the testing, said that despite
minority gains, only one black 17-year-old student in 300 and
``barely 1 percent of the Hispanic kids'' scored at the advanced
level, compared with 7.6 percent of the whites.
   Lawmakers decried the study's findings.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., called it ``tragic'' and said, ``To
the question, `Mathematics: are we measuring up?' the answer is,
simply, no.''
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Education and Labor Committee, called it ``quite sobering'' and said
it was ``shameful that Japanese companies seeking to open plants
here must use graduate students to do calculations done by high
schoolers in Japan.''
   The tests indicated girls and boys ``had identical average
mathematics proficiency'' at age 9, but boys outscored girls at 13
and 17.
   ``Females tend to outperform males on tasks where there is an
obvious procedural rule to follow, while the reverse seems to be
true when the strategy for solving the problem is less apparent,''
the study said.
   The National Assessment devised its own 0-to-500-point scale to
chart students' proficiency. The percentages of 9-, 13- and
17-year-old students at or above the five proficiency levels in 1986
were:
   _Level 150. Simple Arithmetic Facts. 97.8 percent of 9-year-olds,
100 percent of 13-year-olds, 100 percent of 17-year-olds.
   _Level 200. Beginning Skills and Understanding. 73.9, 98.5, 99.9.
   _Level 250. Basic Operations and Beginning Problem Solving. 20.8,
73.1, 96.0.
   _Level 300. Moderately Complex Procedures and Reasoning. 0.6,
15.9, 51.1.
   _Level 350. Multistep Problem-solving and Algebra. 0.0, 0.4, 6.4.
   The average score for 9-year-olds tested in 1986 was 221.7; for
13-year-olds, 269, and for 17-year-olds, 302.
   For white students, the average scores for the three ages were:
226.9, 273.6 and 307.5. For black students, 201.6, 249.2 and 278.6.
For Hispanics, 205.4, 254.3 and 283.1.
   In separate grade-level scores, Asian-American students trailed
whites in grade 3, but were far ahead in grades 7 and 11. The
Asian-Americans averaged 211.3, 288.6 and 330.6.

   Worshipers at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in
search of the biblical land of milk and honey need only look to the
rafters.
   At least that's where the honey _ along with an estimated 50,000
bees _ is hiding.
   The Rev. John Fricke said the bees took up residence in the
cathedral's rain gutters and under the roof about 10 years ago. They
never caused a problem, he said, except for the occasional dripping
of honey down an inside pillar.
   But when a contractor said he wouldn't do some needed painting
because of the bees, Fricke found himself a beekeeper.
   Working on a 40-foot scaffolding Monday, Roger Miller of Bellevue
estimated there is a colony of 50,000 bees and the honeycomb
contains as much as 1,000 pounds of honey.
   The church had hoped to save the honeycomb and bees, Miller said,
but the large size and location, extending under the roof, made it
impossible.
   A scraper pole will be used to break the honeycomb into pieces,
remove it and collect the honey. The worker bees will be killed
using aerosol spray after Miller locates and removes the queen.

   Inside the large green and white striped
tent, an orange-haired clown with a bulbous nose and a British
accent told his audience how he keeps the kiddies laughing at
birthday parties back home.
   Kooky, alias Andrew Stevens of Devizes, England, is one of four
clown instructors from England at the clown camp being held this
week and next at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse.
   The event is in its eighth year, said Snowflake, the clown who
started it all. Snowflake is Richard Snowberg, 46, administrator of
the audiovisual center at the university.
   The 390 student clowns, whose average age is close to 50, come
from 35 states, Bermuda, Canada and England. They paid $295 each,
per week, to sleep in dormitories without air conditioning, eat
their meals on campus and pick up tips about clowning during
lectures, workshops, performances and discussions.
   Classes are scheduled on such topics as how to walk on stilts,
paint a clown face, make balloon animals and develop a costume and
character.
   There are also classes on clowning at hospitals and nursing
homes, writing clown gospel skits, juggling, the use of props,
unicycle riding, magic acts and how to conduct a clown ministry.
   Before Kooky began his demonstration of the nonsense that kids
have come to love, he shared his first rule: ``Never unload the car
first. Check that you've got the right house.''

   Navy crews mistook undersea rocks for
alien submarines and dropped depth charges on them during recent
anti-sub operations, a defense staff spokesman said Tuesday.
   On Tuesday, the navy, using sonar and other tracking gear,
attacked a suspicious-looking object off the southwestern port of
Goteborg. Sailors fired charges at another object Sunday off
Oxelosund, on the Baltic east coast, said spokesman H.G. Wessberg.
   Later checks by frogmen showed that the ``intruders'' were rocks
that resembled submarines, he said. Blast damage to the rocks showed
that the navy was on target.
   ``But investigations of the sea bottoms in six other areas where
we have used weapons indicate no other explanation than foreign
underwater activity there,'' Wessberg said.
   Since May 30, Sweden has carried out eight operations with mines
and live ammunition against suspected foreign submarines.
   Military authorities of this neutral country have reported
snooping by foreign submarines regularly since a Soviet sub ran
aground outside a naval base in southern Sweden in 1981.
   No intruders have been caught since then, although a government
commission identified 1982 intruders as Soviet submarines, and the
government lodged a diplomatic protest.

<HEAD>Indian Troops Begin Withdrawal From Sri Lanka</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRINCOMALEE, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Indian soldiers were
withdrawn from Sri Lanka on Tuesday since India sent more than
50,000 peacekeeping troops to the island 10 months ago.
   About 400 soldiers sat cross-legged on a dock in this port city
waiting to sail home to Madras in southern India.
   Indian officials had said earlier that as many as 3,000 Indian
soldiers would be withdrawn this week. But, citing security reasons,
they declined Tuesday to give specific figures.
   Indian army musicians played martial music on bagpipes as about a
dozen armored personnel carriers and several jeeps and trucks were
hoisted aboard an Indian freighter.
   ``Do not call this a withdrawal, but a thinning out of troops,''
said Sri Lankan Gen. Sepala Attygalle, who attended the ceremony in
Trincomalee, 150 miles northeast of the capital of Colombo.
   The Indians first began arriving on July 30, a day after Sri
Lanka signed an Indian-brokered peace accord aimed at ending the
civil war in the northeast of the island between Tamil rebels and
the Sinhalese Buddhists.
   Many among the Sinhalese have opposed the presence of the Indian
troops, who they fear may stay on the island.
   ``This is the beginning of the end of suspicions and
apprehensions about India's intentions on Sri Lanka,'' said Indian
High Commissioner J.N. Dixit _ the equivalent of ambassador _ who
spoke to a news conference in Colombo after the ceremony.
   Lt. Gen. A.S. Kalkat, the Indian commanding officer in Sri lanka,
praised his departing men for their sacrifice in helping Sri Lanka
restore order in the areas dominated by Tamil guerrillas. At least
480 Indian soldiers have been killed fighting the rebels.
   The latest victim was an Indian soldier who died only hours
before the departure ceremony, when a bomb set by the rebels
exploded as his jeep passed. Four others were injured.
   A Sri Lankan officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the attack six miles south of Trincomalee was intended as ``a slap
in the face'' of the departing Indians.
   ``All Sri Lankans should thank (the Indians) for their services
and fighting to preserve the independence and unity of this
country,'' Sri Lankan President Junius R. Jayewardene told
Parliament on Tuesday.
   Jayewardene said he expected the fighting to end soon in the
northeast so that elections could be held there for new provincial
councils.
   The peace accord called for the Tamils to lay down their arms in
exchange for the creation of district councils, which would allow
the Tamils to take control of their local schools and social
services.
   But elections to choose the councils have not been scheduled in
the Tamil-dominated areas because of the continued fighting.
Government officials have said they hope to hold them by July.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, claim they are discriminated against by
the Sinhalese Buddhists.
   India became involved because its own 60 million Tamils are
sympathetic to their Sri Lankan brethren, who launched an
independence campaign on the island in 1983.
   The largest and most extreme of the rebel groups, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, rejected the peace accord and continued
fighting.

<HEAD>Attorney: Son Shot Police Officer Father Because of Repeated Abuse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For 18 years, police ignored complaints that one
of their own regularly beat his wife and children, and now his
oldest child stands accused of shooting his father in revenge, an
attorney said Tuesday.
   Authorities charged Henry Taylor III, 18, with attempted murder
in the shooting Saturday of policeman Henry Taylor Jr., whom a judge
labeled ``a time bomb'' after hearing allegations of abuse.
   The teen-ager woke his father sleeping on a couch and said,
``This is for you'' before blasting him six times with a .25-caliber
pistol, authorities said.
   Taylor's wife, Paula, contends that over the last 18 years she
called the police more than 100 times to complain that her husband
was abusing her or their four children, said Chester Blair, the
younger Taylor's attorney.
   ``It was just a regular procedure of her calling the police,
complaining that he was beating her or beating the kids or
threatening her with a weapon,'' Blair alleged.
   Police did little, Blair said, because ``there is a tendency for
them to protect their own.''
   Police have begun an internal investigation into the allegations
by Blair and Mrs. Taylor, said department spokeswoman Tina Vicini.
She said she couldn't respond directly to the allegations.
   Blair said Mrs. Taylor never went through with filing a formal
complaint against her husband. Once, when she tried to press
charges, her husband said he would swear out countercharges against
his wife and their children, he said.
   ``So she dropped the charges because she didn't want to put her
children through being charged for something they didn't have
anything to do with,'' Blair said.
   In a domestic dispute, the injured party may sign a criminal
complaint and a court date will be set. If the crime is a
misdemeanor, the defendant is held until posting bond; if it is a
felony, a state's attorney is summoned to interview the complainant,
witnesses and the accused, and decide whether to file charges.
   Taylor, 55, was in fair condition Tuesday with two gunshot wounds
in the head and four in the neck, said hospital spokeswoman Holly
Rea.
   Police records show that Taylor has received psychiatric
treatment and has been on disability leave because of emotional
problems, Blair said. Ms. Vicini confirmed that Taylor has been on
disability but said she didn't know why.
   ``The shooting was caused, I believe, by a battered-son
syndrome,'' Blair said. ``The father would beat up the mother, and
the son, who was the oldest of their four children, would intercede
on behalf of the mother.
   ``The father would taunt him and say he was the mother's
bodyguard and then beat the son.''
   During a bond hearing Monday for the younger Taylor, Blair filed
a motion in Cook County Circuit Court with examples of the alleged
abuse by the elder Taylor, a 32-year veteran of the department.
   After listening to the allegations, Associate Circuit Judge
Michael Bolan reduced the son's bond from $500,000 to $10,000 and
called the elder Taylor ``an absolute menace to his immediate
family.''
   ``He's a time bomb who goes off and repeatedly goes off,'' the
judge said.
   In the most recent incident, Blair said Taylor threatened to kill
his wife May 24 with a pistol and then chased his son around the
yard, threatening to kill him, after he tried to help his mother.
   Police took the elder Taylor's gun but didn't arrest him because
they considered it a domestic dispute, Blair said.
   ``When a policeman is called to the home of a fellow officer, he
treats him as a fellow officer and he treats everyone else as an
outsider,'' Blair said. ``So if the officer is accused, they listen
to him instead of the person making the complaint.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration had told
its inspectors to become more heavily involved in the ``hands-on''
surveillance of maintenance on older jetliners, agency officials
said Tuesday.
   The directive is among a variety of actions planned within the
agency as a result of a three-day industry conference concluded last
week on how to assure that aging jetliners are kept in safe
condition.
   The conference grew out of the April 28 accident in which a
19-year-old Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 tore apart during a flight,
causing a 20-foot section of the cabin wall and ceiling to separate.
A flight attendant was killed when she was swept from the plane.
   FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn said that among other steps resulting
from last week's conference on aging aircraft, the agency would:
   _Develop ways to improve the sharing within the industry of
technical information about aging aircraft.
   _Establish additional testing techniques to determine the life of
a jetliner.
   _Place increased emphasis within the FAA on ``human factor
aspects'' of aircraft maintenance and inspection to reduce the
likelihood that such work is not being done properly.
   The FAA also plans at some point to examine some commuter
aircraft for signs of aging, Buckhorn said.

   Arab leaders began a three-day emergency summit Tuesday in
Algiers, Algeria to discuss support for the 6-month-old Palestinian

   She said she entered Algeria on a tourist visa and did not know

<TEXT>
   A Senate subcommittee, following the lead of
the House, approved an energy and water development spending bill
Tuesday that provides no money to begin construction of new water
projects next year.
   The appropriations legislation for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct.
1, contains $18.05 billion but nothing for new starts by the Army
Corps of Engineers or the Interior Department's Bureau of
Reclamation.
   Chairman Bennett Johnston, D-La., said the Appropriations energy
and water development subcommittee had requests for nearly three
dozen new dams, irrigation systems and harbor improvements but was
able to hold the line.
   ``If we make any exceptions, the dam is broken and the flood
starts,'' said Johnston as his panel voiced its approval of a
modified version of the $17.8 billion, no-new-starts spending
package voted by the House last month.
   The subcommittee also followed the House line on funding for the
superconducting super collider, the multibillion-dollar high-energy
physics project recommended by the Reagan administration.
   The panel approved spending $100 million on preliminary research
for the project, but like the House it decreed that non be used to
begin construction.
   ``We're going to buck this decision to the next president,''
Johnston said. ``If he finds the (construction) money, we'll go
ahead with it.''
   Nearly half the Senate package _ $8.1 billion _ is earmarked for
the Department of Energy for defense-related nuclear activities.
Much of the remaining money would go to continue construction work
on dozens of water projects and to pay for operation and maintenance
on hundreds more.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III is considering
going to the Republican National Convention, despite the political
embarrassment some Republicans say his legal problems are causing
Vice President George Bush.
   ``Cabinet officers traditionally attend these events and the
attorney general is prepared to do so,'' Justice Department
spokesman Patrick Korten said Tuesday.
   Korten said Meese's tentative schedule calls for him to be
present for part of the convention, with the precise dates of any
appearance still to be determined.
   Meese would not stay through the whole GOP convention, which runs
from Aug. 15-18 in New Orleans.
   The attorney general has been the subject of a criminal
investigation for nearly 13 months. The probe focusing on Meese's
involvement with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion
Iraqi oil pipeline project is about to end, and a report to be
issued soon is expected to raise questions about Meese's conduct.
   At the attorney general's request, Meese and Bush met privately
in May and Meese promised not to do anything that would jeopardize
Bush's candidacy. White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has said
that Meese's legal difficulties could hurt Republican prospects of
holding onto the White House.
   Some Bush aides have made similar public comments, although Bush
himself has not.
   Meanwhile, Meese was to meet late Tuesday afternoon with a group
of moderate Republicans from the House, known as The 92 Group. In
recent weeks, the attorney general has met with conservative
senators and congressmen, telling them he has no intention of
stepping down. At a meeting May 25, at least two conservative House
members said Meese's legal problems were causing political damage to
the Republican Party and to Bush's presidential campaign.
   In another indication that Meese plans to remain at the Justice
Department, Korten, the newly appointed director of the department's
public affairs office, has hired two aides, John Allen and Timothy
Sullivan, to assist him in promoting the attorney general's agenda.
   Allen is handling special projects for Korten while Sullivan will
handle writing duties. Both aides worked with Korten at the Office
of Personnel Management, while Sullivan, most recently a political
consultant in Manassas, Va., also has worked at the Republican
National Committee.
   The speech-writing unit at the Justice Department has been
without a director since William Schambra resigned last month, the
same day that Meese's chief spokesman, Terry Eastland, said the
attorney general had fired him for not defending Meese aggressively
enough. Sullivan will handle some speech-writing duties, but the
position of head of the unit will remain vacant.

   Iran's parliament re-elected Hashemi

   Rafsanjani's re-election to the key position came only five days
after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini named him commander-in-chief of
the country's armed forces. That appointment followed two serious
military defeats for Iran in the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, reported that 187 of the 192 parliamentary deputies whose
credentials had been approved since elections in April and May voted
for Rafsanjani. Five abstained.
   Radicals, many of them Rafsanjani supporters, made sweeping gains
in the elections at the expense of conservatives who have blocked
economic reforms.
   The elction sharpened divisions between radicals, who seek a
centralized state-run economy, and the conservatives, who are backed
by the ``Bazaaris,'' the wealthy merchant class.
   Rafsanjani, 53, was named temporary speaker when the parliament,
or Majlis, convened May 28, pending a two-thirds quorum to elect a
permanent speaker. He has been speaker since 1980.
   The Majlis also elected two deputy speakers Tuesday, IRNA
reported.
   One is Hojatoleslam Mehdi Karroubi, a middle-ranking cleric who
is the militant head of the Pilgrimage Bureau and believed to have
been responsible for masterminding riots by Iranian pilgrims in the
Holy Moslem city of Mecca last year. Hundreds of people died in the
riots.
   The other is Hussein Hashemian, a little-known deputy from
Rafsanjani's hometown of Rafsanjan in southeast Iran.
   Rafsanjani's re-election appeared to set the seal on his
political power.
   He is already Khomeini's representative on the Supreme Defense
Council, which determines Iran's strategy in the war. He sits on the
Council for the Expediency of State Decrees, formed earlier this
year by Khomeini to push radical economic reforms through parliament.
   Rafsanjani also has strong links with the Revolutionary Guards
Corps, which is now more powerful than the Iranian army, and leader
of the clerics who deliver sermons at the weekly Friday prayer
sessions in Tehran, an influential religious and political platform.
   Rafsanjani's widening power leaves him well-placed to become the
kingmaker in the power struggle among Iran's fractious leadership
that is expected to swell when Khomeini dies.
   The 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch has been reported in poor
health. Speculation that his condition was deteriorating was
heightened when he relinquished his constitutional position as
commander-in-chief to Rafsanjani, a middle-ranking cleric.
   There has been no hard evidence to support that. But the New York
Times reported that some U.S. officials believe Rafsanjani's
appointment indicated Khomeini may no longer be capable or willing
to continue to run military affairs.
   Khomeini has designated a senior cleric, Ayatollah Hussein-Ali
Montazeri, as his successor.
   But Montazari is opposed by many leading figures and is widely
expected to be little more than figurehead for a small group of
political heavyweights led by the charismatic Rafsanjani after
Khomeini dies.
   Khomeinis appointment of Rafsanjani, long a close aide, as
military leader underlined that Rafsanjani has his confidence and is
apparently being groomed to hold the reins of power in the critical
era that will follow Khomeini's death.
   Rafsanjani is also close to Khomeini's son and confidant, Ahmed.

<HEAD>OTA Study Says Soviets Could Knock Out Anti-Missile System</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf bgng ``Pentagon and SDI ... '' to update with
reaction from SDI Organization.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Soviet Union could launch nuclear-tipped
rockets that would threaten to knock out the proposed early-round
version of President Reagan's Star Wars anti-missile system, a
scientific study said Tuesday.
   The U.S. system also would be threatened by the possibility that
the enormously complex software needed to run its computers might
fail the first and only time it would be used, the congressional
Office of Technology Assessment said.
   The conclusions are part of a 2-year-long OTA study that raises
new questions about Reagan's program, known formally the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, in a statement,
said the report ``reflects a decidedly more constructive and
balanced assessment than previous reports by OTA.''
   But the statement disputed OTA's comments about computer
software, claiming the study failed ``to acknowledge the positive
achievements and the real operating record of such systems'' as the
Safeguard ballistic missile defense, which operated for a 10-month
period early in the last decade.
   The OTA study was publicly released despite the fact that the
Pentagon had refused to declassify three chapters dealing with ways
the Soviets could counter the American system.
   When Reagan announced his program in 1983, he proposed that it
should be aimed at making nuclear weapons obsolete. SDI officials
have been overseeing research into a wide variety of futuristic
technologies, including lasers and beam weapons.
   But in the past two years, SDI officials and supporters of the
program have been pushing for a less comprehensive ``phase one'' SDI
system which could be started in the mid-1990s. The second and third
phases of such a system would be constructed later.
   Last year, the Pentagon told Congress that a phase one SDI system
costing $75 billion to $150 billion could be deployed using a
combination of ground-based rockets and space-based rockets that
would be parked in orbiting ``garages,'' ready to fire at attacking
Soviet missiles.
   But the Soviets could attack such a system with anti-satellite
(ASAT) rockets using nuclear-tipped weapons, the OTA study said. The
Soviets now have an operational ASAT system.
   The Soviet ASATs ``would pose a significant threat to all three
defense system phases, but particularly to the first two,'' OTA said.
   ``Such weapons deployed in quantity, especially with multiple
decoys (to confuse the U.S. system) would threaten to degrade
severely the performance of a first- or second-phase'' SDI system,
the study said.
   The study was the second OTA report critical of Reagan's Star
Wars plan. Other scientific reports have also questioned the
feasibility of SDI goals.
   The OTA study also raised questions about the software that would
be used to run the SDI computers. Other studies have raised
questions about whether reliable software, which would be far more
complex than anything previously put together, can be developed.
   Thomas H. Karas, director of the OTA study, said there is ``a
significant probability'' that the software would fail the first
time it was used in a real situation.
   The study noted that ``the nature of software and experience with
large, complex software systems indicate that there may always be
irresolvable questions about how dependable'' the SDI programs
``would be and about the confidence the United States could place in
dependability estimates.''
   In addition, any attempt to realistically test the software could
only be done by computer simulation and thus it would also be
dependent on software, Karas said.
   The study said there are ``no adequate models for the
development, production, test and maintainance of software for
full-scale'' missile defense systems.
   Karas said he didn't understand why public release of the three
chapters had been refused by the Pentagon. They were so general that
the Soviets could not likely gain much military advantage from
reading the material, he said.
   The study said it was difficult to come up with a ``precise
degree'' of how well the U.S. system could survive a Soviet attack
because that would depend ``on the tactics employed by each side and
on the evitable uncertainties of battle.''
   The Democratic-controlled Congress has consistently cut Reagan's
requests for SDI spending. The program is funded at $3.9 billion in
the current fiscal year.
   For the 1989 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the Senate has voted
$4.6 billion while the House has approved $3.5 billion, with a
compromise to be worked out by a Senate-House conference committee.
Reagan had sought $4.8 billion.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
who underwent surgery for stomach cancer Tuesday in Washington, sent
a message to Salvadoran military appealing for unity and respect for
civilian government.
   The message, published Tuesday by the newspaper Prensa Grafica,
urges the high comnmand to consider ``the immense, historic
responsibility that is yours to guarantee the dynamic of the process
that we are moving forward.''
   It said the military learned ``to be historically aware of its
true role'' and ``that conduct should be promoted and maintained so
pluralistic democracy becomes irreversible in our country, and in no
circumstances is interrupted by actions of force or coups.''
   Coup rumors have circulated since March, when Duarte's Christian
Democratic Party lost to the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance in National Assembly and municipal elections.
   He asked the armed forces to remain united because ``much remains
to be done, in the first place to end the conflict that bleeds our
country.''
   More than eight years of war between leftist rebels and
U.S.-supported governments have devastated an economy once among the
strongest in Central America.
   A broadcast Tuesday on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos
said: ``The apparent unity of the armed institution is artificial''
and ``the contradictions are starting to be demonstrated publicly.''
   A statement released Tuesday by Walter Reed Army Medical Center
in Washington said Duarte, 62, underwent surgery to remove cancerous
tissue from his stomach but doctors left his diseased liver
untouched.
   Duarte went to Washington on May 31, leaving Vice President
Rodolfo Castillo Claramount in charge.

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The office that handles final appeals
for death row inmates told the Florida Supreme Court on Tuesday that
it's out of money until the new fiscal year July 1, although it has
three active death warrants to defend.
   ``I just said, `I'm broke,''' said Larry Spalding, Capital
Collateral Representative, in describing his arguments before the
high court.
   Spalding said he asked the court for some relief, either through
staying the three warrants until the next budget year, or by having
someone supply his office with additional funds.
   ``The question is, what relief can they give us and whose
responsibility is it?'' Spalding said.
   Carolyn Snurkowski, an assistant attorney general, argued that
the agency can get through the remaining three weeks of the fiscal
year without relief.
   The high court gave no indication on when it will rule, but
Spalding and Ms. Snurkowski expect a speedy decision.
   Of the three active warrants the office said it has no money to
defend, one is for Ernesto Suarez, whose execution is scheduled June
22 in the electric chair at Florida State Prison near Starke. The
other two inmates are Daniel Karr Johnson, scheduled to die July 7,
and Robert Ira Peede, July 8.
   The CCR's money woes, Spalding said, are the result of several
facors, including the number of death warrants signed by Gov. Bob
Martinez, moving the office into more expensive quarters and the
large number of hearings and other expenses involved in handling
death cases.
   Spalding estimates his office needs $60,000 to $70,000 to make it
through the year. Its total budget is $1.4 million.

<HEAD>Actors Make Plea To Keep Costumes Of The Stars In Hollywood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nostalgia buffs and city officials are
battling over where Hollywood fashion memorabilia _ including Fred
Astaire's shoes and Rudolph Valentino's cape _ should be stored.
   Debbie Reynolds and Glenn Ford, along with other stars, say they
want the celebrity outfits in Hollywood. The city's Department of
Recreation and Parks says the costumes should stay in safe storage
at the downtown Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, where
they were moved two weeks ago.
   Until the move, the more than 200 costumes were stored for two
decades in the dilapidated environs of the old Lincoln Heights Jail.
   In a news conference Monday at the Hollywood Studio Museum, Miss
Reynolds and Ford joined others in a plea on behalf of the Hollywood
Heritage preservationist organization.
   ``Hollywood history should stay in Hollywood, at a Hollywood
museum,'' Miss Reynolds said.
   Linda Barth of the Department of Recreation and Parks said
security at the fashion institute was appealing, including security
``from environmental factors, financial ability and the type and
number of conservators.''
   The garments were originally part of a collection owned by
Hollywood Museum Associates. But the group could not raise enough
money to establish a museum and the collection was sold to the city
for $22,000. The costumes were first stored at a Bekins building,
then moved to the old jail.
   ``I visited there (jail) in 1986 when there was a plumbing leak
and everything was under two inches of water,'' said Richard Adkins,
executive director of Hollywood Heritage. ``A cape worn by Rudolph
Valentino in `Monsieur Beaucaire' was damaged.''
   Garments in the collection include outfits worn by Norma Shearer
in ``Idiot's Delight,'' Greta Garbo in ``Inspiration'' and Charles
Laughton and Kirk Douglas in ``Spartacus.''
   Miss Reynolds said she would push for a larger Hollywood museum
to house the memorabilia ``until the day I drop dead.''
   ``Hopefully, by then, it'll be built,'' she said.

<HEAD>Congress Passes Land Reform Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress passed a land reform law
early Wednesday that gives landowners the choice of dividing their
property among tenants or sharing profits with them.
   The bill, which goes to President Corazon Aquino for her
signature, is expected to benefit two million farmers in this
largely agricultural nation of 7,100 islands.
   Land reform is considered essential to defeating the 19-year-old
communist insurgency, which has its main support in rural areas.
   All but one of the 19 senators present approved the bill Tuesday.
Sen. Vicente Paterno, a landowner, abstained and the other four
members left before the vote.
   The 203-member House of Representatives passed the measure at
1:15 a.m. Wednesday by a vote of 152-20 with four abstentions.
   Officials have said the program, estimated to cost $70 billion,
will be financed by foreign aid and assets of exiled President
Ferdinand Marcos and his allies that were seized on grounds they
were illegally acquired.
   Marcos governed the Philippines for 20 years but was driven from
the country in February 1986 by a civilian-military uprising that
brought Mrs. Aquino to power.
   A conference committee of the two houses had spent two weeks
reconciling provisions of the House and Senate versions.
   Sen. Heherson Alvarez, a former agrarian reform minister who
sponsored the legislation, said it would bring ``democratization of
the means of production.''
   Rep. Jose Cojuangco, Mrs. Aquino's younger brother, voted in
favor despite earlier doubts about the measure. ``There are a few
sections that have to be amended, but for the first time this bill
will really accomplish a genuine land reform,'' he said.
   The president's owns a 14,820-acre sugar plantation in Tarlac
province north of Manila.
   Rep. Bonifacio Gillego sponsored the original House bill but
withdrew after changes began. He voted against the legislation
Wednesday and told his colleagues they were ``foisting a grand
deception on our people.''
   Each landowner may retain 12 acres and an additional seven for
each direct heir over age 15 who will till the land. A landowner
also has the option of sharing profits or giving tenants shares of
stock instead of physically dividing the property.
   Gillego said farmers would oppose the profit-sharing option and
it might ``result in agrarian reform, if you will, through a
revolution.'' Leftist farmers' groups have said the bill favors
landowners.
   It also provides for the transfer to farm workers of tracts of
public land greater than 2,470 acres now leased to multinational
corporations.
   Government lands will be the first distributed in the 10-year
program. Private holdings of more than 50 hectares (123.5 acres)
will be parceled out in the first four years and smaller holdings
later.
   Owners of more than 50 hectares will be paid 25 percent of the
value in cash and those with less than 24 hectares (59.9 acres) will
be paid 35 percent in cash.
   Tax exemptions, shares of stock in government-owned or controlled
corporations or Land Bank of the Philippines bonds will make up the
rest of the compensation.

<TEXT>
   The government-controlled media still
attack an opposition rendered voiceless by the closure of four
newspapers, a television station and three radio stations critical
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``I do not think they will allow the news media to reopen,''
Winston Robles, director of the shuttered daily newspaper La Prensa,
said of Noriega's government. ``They cannot co-exist with a free
press.
   ``How can the government talk of elections next year when there
is no freedom of the press?'' Robles said in a recent interview.
   The government has indicated that Noriega, who was indicted on
charges of drug trafficking in the United States, may run for
president in the May 1989 election.
   The dailies El Siglo and Extra, the weekly Quiubo, Channel 5
television, and radio stations La Exitosa, KW Continente and Radio
Mundial also have been closed. All are owned by critics of the
Noriega-controlled government.
   The media controlled by the government or sympathetic to Noriega
relentlessly criticize the opposition forces who want to oust the
general, who as head of the nation's 15,000-member Defense Forces is
considered the country's de facto leader.
   The government's radio and television station and the three daily
newspapers who support Noriega constantly ridicule opposition
leaders, often describing them as lackeys of the United States.
   They also criticize the United States and its allies. Last week,
the daily La Republica said in a headline that President Jose
Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador has cancer because he once kissed an
American flag.
   Only La Estrella, the nation's oldest newspaper, sometimes gives
space to opposition comment.
   Opposition efforts to obtain court orders or get official word
about reopening have been fruitless.
   La Prensa was first closed on July 26. It was allowed to reopen
Jan. 20, shortly before President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire
Noriega as head of the Defense Forces. Delvalle, who owns Channel 5,
was instead deposed by Noriega supporters in the Legislative
Assembly.
   On Feb. 25, soldiers who said they were acting on the ``order of
a higher authority'' closed down La Prensa again. Police have since
guarded the building.
   ``We have no access to our equipment or files in the building,''
said Robles. ``We cannot find out who ordered the closing down of
the newspaper, what we are accused of or what is going to happen.''
   The newspaper filed suit against Noriega in the Supreme Court,
holding him responsible for the closure.
   But the Supreme Court rejected the petition late last month,
saying it had no jurisdiction and could not fix blame for the
closure because the soldiers who shut down La Prensa had no written
orders.
   On Monday, nine officials from the attorney general's office and
three police officers went to the La Prensa building for what they
described as an ``investigation.'' They refused to provide any
details about their inquiry.
   Ruben Dario Carles, chairman of the board of La Prensa, said the
paper will put its case before the InterAmerican Human Rights
Commission and appeal for support from the embassies of several
Latin American countries.

   A fire killed five children and two adults
Tuesday in a second-floor apartment, and the sole door to the home
was padlocked, the fire chief said.
   The padlocking violated city fire code, Chief Don Lickert said,
adding that six of the victims were found beneath a boarded window
that also may have prevented their escape. He could not immediately
say if boarded windows broke city codes.
   The seventh victim was found in a second-floor hall, Lickert said.
   Butler County Coroner Dr. Richard Burkhardt ruled the victims
died of smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. Three adults
were injured and hospitalized, officials said.
   The street-level access door for the apartments that burned was
padlocked from the outside, apparently by the residents as a
security measure, Lickert said.
   Lickert said the residents locked and unlocked the door by
reaching through an adjacent window, but apparently couldn't do it
amid the fire and smoke.
   Elizabeth Blackburn, who said she owns the building with her
husband, Art, said she was unaware of the padlock.
   At least one smoke detector should have been in each of the three
apartments in sleeping rooms plus another in the hall, but
firefighters found only one smoke detector without batteries,
Lickert said. City inspectors had noted the lack of smoke detectors
in a previous inspection and Blackburn had them installed, but
firefighters could not account for the missing detectors, Lickert
said.
   The fire chief said the cause of the fire remained under
investigation. The blaze started about 4 a.m. in a living room,
firefighters said.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Chicago's `Worst' Schools Best Place To Try Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago's public schools, labeled the worst in the
nation by Education Secretary William Bennett, could be the best
place to try changes that would help students learn, Bennett said
Tuesday.
   ``There are radical proposals in the air,'' Bennett said. ``This
may be a revolutionary time.''
   Speaking to reporters after the annual meeting of the Chicago
Council on Foreign Relations, Bennett suggested the 430,000-pupil
system consider a voucher plan in which parents could choose schools
and the government would pick up the tab.
   ``If you tried it, tried it honestly and fairly, I would predict
it would improve things dramatically,'' he said.
   Bennett also said the school system's bureaucracy was ``the
blob.'' He called for redistributing power to give parents and local
school principals more say over curriculum, personnel and other
policies.
   Last November, Bennett called Chicago's public schools, plagued
by low test scores and high dropout rates, the worst in the nation
and an ``education meltdown.'' He later accused teachers' unions of
blocking reform.
   He said Tuesday that his view of Chicago's system hasn't changed
much.
   ``If it's not the worst, it's too ... close to the worst,'' he
said.
   Nearly 45 percent of the students who began school with the class
of 1985 dropped out before graduating. State figures also show that
half of Chicago's public high schools ranked in the bottom 1 percent
of U.S. schools for student scores on the American College Test.
   But Bennett said that whatever comes out of efforts to improve
the schools ``may be able to point the way for other school systems
in the country.''
   Bennett stayed out of a fight in the Illinois General Assembly
over a state income tax increase, although he said ``I am not
convinced that it takes money'' to change schools for the better.
   He said any new state money for education in Chicago must be tied
to a reform package that would shift power in the system.
   ``You must give the people who run your schools the power, the
autonomy, to run those schools,'' he said. ``Then you must hold them
accountable for the results.''
   Calling any reform that didn't redistribute power ``nonsense,''
Bennett said unions interested only in ``getting more and more for
everyone'' may be hurt in the short run. But positive changes in
schools would help unions in the long run by raising the
professional esteem of teachers.
   Bennett visited two Chicago schools in March at the request of
Chicago Teachers Union. He said afterward that ``intransigence of
special interests'' such as unions remain the biggest obstacle to
reform.
   Jacqueline Vaughn, president of the Chicago union, said then that
cutbacks in government funds were the real culprits.

<TEXT>
   The National Gallery of Art will celebrate the
10th anniversary of its modernistic East Building with a two-year
exhibition of its small but rapidly growing collection of 20th
century art, gallery officials said Tuesday.
   The show, which will open Dec. 4, will include about 250 works by
modern artists ranging from Pablo Picasso to Andy Warhol. It will
occupy more than half of the building's 55,000 square feet of
gallery space on three of its five levels.
   ``The new exhibition will demonstrate our progress in expanding
the gallery's collection of modern art,'' said director J. Carter
Brown.
   About 60 percent of the paintings, sculptures and drawings in the
show will come from the gallery's permanent collection. Half of
those were acquired in the decade since the East Building opened on
June 1, 1978. The remaining works will be on loan from private
collections.
   Curator Jack Cowart said that although the East Building was
designed in part by architect I.M. Pei specifically to house the
gallery's modern art collection, the only permanent exhibition site
for those works has been on the less visible concourse or basement
level of the building.
   Cowart said 20th century art was virtually non-existent at the
National Gallery until the early 1960s, when the gallery received a
gift of about 100 works of modern art from the Chester Dale
collection.
   Since then, he said, the gallery's collection has grown steadily
with the goal of assembling a high-quality range of modern masters,
although there is no pretense of matching the vast numbers of New
York's Museum of Modern Art or Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   ``We acquire carefully, slowly and with great care,'' said
Cowart, who estimated that about 90 percent of the gallery's
acquisitions are gifts rather than purchases.
   Two major gifts were made in 1986, when the gallery acquired more
than 900 drawings and 100 paintings by American artist Mark Rothko
and ``The Stations of the Cross,'' a 15-painting series by Barnett
Newman.
   The gallery's modern paintings, sculptures and decorative art
objects have grown in the past decade from 272 to 613 works,
compared with thousands in other collections. ``Our center of
gravity is the old masters,'' Brown conceded.
   The exhibition opening in December, involving extensive
remodeling of the East Building's gallery spaces, will move 20th
century art upstairs from the basement ``to give the collection a
presence the public can count on,'' Cowart said.
   The tower and upper levels will feature pre-World War II artists
such as Picasso, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque and Amedeo
Modigliani. The concourse galleries will highlight the works of
postwar artists such as Warhol, Newman, Jackson Pollock, Roy
Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns.
   Brown said the exhibition may embark on a national tour once it
closes at the East Building in December 1990.

   The Office of Management and Budget said
Tuesday that legislation under consideration by the House
Appropriations Committee would slash $686 million from funds the
Reagan administration seeks to combat drug abuse.
   ``At a time when various members of Congress are calling for
increased federal drug spending in the face of a drug crisis of
unparalleled proportions, the Commerce, Justice and State
appropriations bill ... would actually reduce'' fiscal 1989 funding,
OMB said in a statement.
   The budget office complained that the bill would provide
``essentially a freeze'' on the spending levels for anti-drug
programs administered by the Justice Department.
   It said that instead of approving the $2.67 billion that Reagan
requested in the budget for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1,
the committee proposes appropriating only $1.98 billion, or $686
million less than was sought.
   The bill being marked up by the House Appropriations Committee
involves money for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau
of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals office and U.S. attorneys offices
across the country.
   ``The president's FY 1989 budget requested sufficient funds to
preserve the momentum of the federal government's war on drug abuse
in the three key areas of prevention, treatment and law
enforcement,'' OMB said in a statement released at the White House.
``Should Congress provide less than the president's request,
programs to combat illegal drugs will suffer.''
   Reagan told a U.S. Coast Guard Academy graduating class last
month that he wanted to see the national drug debate depoliticized,
and he proposed creation of a joint executive-legislative task force
to recommend solutions.
   But no such joint task force has yet been constituted, although
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and House Minority Leader Bob
Michel, R-Ill., have study groups working on legislative proposals.
   OMB said that under the legislation the House Appropriations
Committee is poised to recommend:
   _There would be no financing of 177 new drug enforcement agents
and support positions, at a cost of $44 million. Plans for expanded
intelligence capabilities and equipment, including aircraft and
computer equipment, would have to be cancelled.
   _The government would not be able to carry out a proposal to add
3,400 positions at a cost of $574 million to reinforce the federal
prison system.
   _It would be impossible to create 566 additional U.S. attorney
and support positions in the prosecution force, at a cost of $44
million, and the prosecution of major organized crime drug task
force cases would be out of the question.
   _There would be no money for the anticipated addition of 161 to
the staff of the U.S. Marshals office, at a cost of $24 million.
Prisoner transportation and the delivery of drug defendants at trial
sites would be adversely affected.

<HEAD>Interest on Fixed Rate Home Mortgages Climbed Again in May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate home
mortgages continued to climb in May, encouraging Americans to turn
to adjustable-rate mortgages, the government said Tuesday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the federal regulator of
savings institutions, said the national average for conventional,
single-family loans jumped to 10.63 percent in early May, up from
10.48 percent in early April.
   It was the second consecutive monthly increase. Since peaking at
11.42 percent just before the October stock market crash, rates had
dropped steadily, hitting 10.33 percent in early March.
   The bank board said rates on the most popular type of one-year,
adjustable-rate mortgages, those with limits on how much the rate
can increase, also rose, but not by as much. They increased to 8.68
percent in May, up from 8.61 percent a month earlier.
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, said the
percentage of mortgages with adjustable rates rose for the first
time in five months to 53 percent in May, up from 49 percent in
April.
   He attributed that to the widening of the spread between the two
types of loans. The gap grew for two months in a row _ from 1.69
percent in March to 1.95 in May.
   A separate weekly report by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,
known as Freddie Mac, show continued increases in fixed-rate
mortgages through May. It said the average last week was 10.58
percent, the same as the previous week but up from 10.32 percent
four weeks before.
   Freddie Mac averages are lower than the bank board's because they
do not include add-on fees, known as points, which are paid by
borrowers.

<HEAD>Extreme Right Offers Deal to Center In Legislative Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The extreme-right National Front said Tuesday it
will withdraw its candidates from six legislative districts in favor
of conservatives and asked the center-right coalition to reciprocate.
   Within hours, candidates from the center-right alliance of the
Union for French Democracy and Rally for the Republic withdrew in a
southern district that includes Marseille, a National Front
stronghold.
   A statement by Jean-Claude Gaudin, UDF leader in the National
Assembly, said a Socialist or Communist would be elected unless
alliance candidates withdrew.
   Conservative leaders remain divided on whether to deal with the
National Front, which is viewed as racist and xenophobic.
   The conservatives and President Francois Mitterrand's Socialists
ran almost even in the first round Sunday of voting for the
577-member National Assembly. Computer projections favor the
Socialists to win a majority in next week's runoff because of the
way support is distributed.
   Marseille and its region has attracted attention because National
Front voters could swing the results in 14 districts.
   A statement by the National Front said its candidates would pull
out in the six districts where they trailed other rightists in the
first round.
   Party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and National Front members who
finished ahead of conservatives in seven races in and around
Marseille will compete in Sunday's runoff and expect reciprocal
withdrawals.
   If the conservatives do not withdraw in those districts, the
Socialist candidates are likely to benefit from the split in the
conservative vote and win National Assembly seats with less than 50
percent of the vote.
   Any candidate who won at least 12.5 percent in the first round
can compete in the runoff, but those without a chance to win
commonly throw their support to one of the top two finishers.
   Maurice Toga, one of the conservative candidates who withdrew,
said he and three others who belong to the Rally for the Republic
would not endorse the National Front.
   ``Our withdrawals are meant only to respect the will of the
voters and to assure the defeat of the candidates of the left
wherever possible,'' he said.
   Former Security Minister Charles Pasqua said the reciprocal
arrangement Tuesday was ``a local and not a national accord.''
   Any alliance between the conservatives and Le Pen's extreme
right, even an unspoken local agreement in Marseille, could backfire
in the rest of the country.
   Michel Noir, trade minister in the conservative government of
Jacques Chirac that resigned after Mitterrand's re-election May 8,
said a deal with the National Front in Marseille might save three or
four seats but cost about 60 elsewhere in France.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., was resting
comfortably at Bethesda Naval Hospital Tuesday after undergoing
surgery to remove a blood clot in his right leg, a spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Dan McKenna, said the clot was caused by Specter
tearing a muscle while playing squash several weeks ago.
   ``I talked to him this morning and he didn't seem to be in any
distress at all,'' McKenna said. He added that Specter hopes to be
released from the hospital Wednesday, in time for an expected vote
on a major trade bill.
   Specter, 58, plays squash daily before work. But he has been
unable to play since he hurt the leg four weeks ago.
   Specter did not know surgery was necessary until several sets of
tests were conducted at the hospital on Monday. After the tests were
done, he went to Capitol Hill for a vote, then returned to the
hospital and found that doctors were recommending precautionary
surgery, according to McKenna.

<HEAD>Jail Suicides Nine Times Higher Than Rate for General Populace,
Study Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The suicide rate among jail inmates is
nine times greater than that of the general population and continues
to be the leading cause of death in city and county lockups,
according to a federally financed study released Tuesday.
   ``Although the average length of stay in jail is approximately 6
to 11 days, 51 percent of all jail suicide victims were dead within
the first 24 hours of incarceration and 29 percent committed suicide
within the first three hours,'' the National Center on Institutions
and Alternatives said.
   ``While alcohol-drug related and minor `other' charges account
for 37 percent of offenses for which jail inmates are confined, they
represented 55 percent of all suicide victims,'' according to the
study of jail suicides in 1985-86.
   Lindsay M. Hayes directed the project, which was supported
through a grant from the National Institute of Corrections in the
Department of Justice. Hayes said the suicide rate in detention
facilities was found to be 107 per 100,000 inmates. Census Bureau
studies show, he said, that the rate is 12.5 per 100,000 in the
general population.
   ``Further, suicide continues to be the leading cause of death in
our nation's jails,'' Hayes said in a statement.
   Texas, California, New York and Illinois recorded 32 percent of
all the suicides in the study. Those states, according to Justice
Department figures, also house one in three jail inmates.
   The numbers of suicides in jails was 453 in 1985 and 401 in 1986,
the study said.
   The findings also showed that 72 percent of the suicide victims
were white, 94 percent were male, the average age of the victim was
30, 60 percent of the victims were intoxicated at the time they were
jailed and two of three victims were in isolation.
   ``While black inmates comprise 41 percent of the jail population,
they acounted for only 16 percent of the jail suicides,'' the study
said. ``While 31 percent of jail inmates are intoxicated by alcohol
upon arrest, over 60 percent of jail suicide victims were
intoxicated upon arrest.''
   Only Rhode Island and Vermont recorded no jail suicides in the
two-year period.

<DATELINE>EL BIREH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli-appointed Arab
mayor of this West Bank town was stabbed in the heart outside his
office Tuesday in an apparent assassination attempt by Palestinian
militants.
   The attack on Hassan Tawil, 74, came as leaders of the Arab
uprising issued a new list of directives, including renewed demands
that all Israeli-appointed Arab officials resign.
   Officials at Ramallah Hospital said Tawil was in serious but
stable condition after surgery. He was stabbed once with a ``very
long knife'' that pierced his heart, diaphragm, liver and stomach, a
doctor said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The PLO-led United Leadership of the Uprising demanded in a new
leaflet that all Israeli-appointed mayors and Arab employees of the
military government step down.
   It called for protests and a general strike Thursday in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, captured by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Since the rebellion began Dec. 8, 201 Palestinians have been
killed and more than 5,000 injured. Two Israelis have died.
   Israeli Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev, who visited El Bireh after
the attack, said he hoped the stabbing would not lead to
resignations.
   Israeli-appointed mayors serve in about a dozen West Bank towns
and cities. Heads of about 85 village councils also are appointed by
the military government.
   The municipalities and village councils provide local services to
the Palestinian population and serve as a buffer and mediator
between the residents and Israel's military authorities. If
appointed officials quit, the Israeli officials replacing them would
find it even more difficult to gain Palestinian cooperation.
   Bar-Lev said police had no immediate leads, but he believed the
assailants had a ``nationalistic motive,'' meaning they were
Palestinian nationalists.
   Yusef Taher, an Arab member of the El Bireh city council, blamed
the attack on Palestinian militants and added: ``I had hoped we
would not descend to the level of assassination.''
   Israel radio reported military officials met with several
appointed West Bank leaders in an effort to persuade them not to
resign. A senior military government official confirmed a meeting
took place but would not elaborate.
   The appointed mayors of Jericho, Ramallah and Hebron refused
comment when asked if they would step down.
   The attacker or attackers ambushed Tawil at about 11:30 a.m. as
he left the town hall, Bar-Lev told reporters. He said Tawil was not
with his bodyguard.
   Minutes after the stabbing, Associated Press photographer Martin
Cleaver saw Tawil slumped against a storefront, surrounded by
soldiers. His face was ashen and a large bloody wound was visible in
his left chest, partially covered by a bandage.
   Cleaver said four soldiers commandeered a passing car and took
Tawil to Ramallah Hospital.
   The army clamped a curfew on El Bireh, a city of 10,000 about
nine miles north of Jerusalem. Hundreds of soldiers patrolled the
city and wouldn't let reporters enter.
   Tawil's wife, Mahdeyah, said in a telephone interview that her
husband had been threatened repeatedly before the stabbing. She said
twice the family house had been attacked with stones and twice with
firebombs.
   ``My kids and I always urged him to resign, but he felt he was
serving his people,'' Tawil's wife said.
   Tawil was named to his post in September 1986 along with the
mayors of Hebron and Ramallah in an effort by Israel to gain
cooperation from Palestinian moderates. The Arab mayors replaced
Israeli officials.
   The appointments came six months after Palestinian militants
assassinated the Israeli-appointed Nablus mayor, Zafer El-Masri.
   Palestinians expressed mixed feelings after Tuesday's stabbing.
   ``He should have stood by his people, but instead he listened to
Israel and Jordan,'' said Mustafa Ibrahim, 25, of Ramallah. ``I hope
we'll hear about the rest (of the appointed mayors) soon.''
   Arab militants have complained that Israel's appointment of
mayors was a scheme to replace the Palestine Liberation
Organization's leadership in the occupied territories with
Jordanian-backed moderates.
   Farah Araj, the elected mayor of Beit Jallah near Bethlehem,
condemned the attack. ``We tried assassinations in the 1930s and
1940s, and it didn't work, but instead made things worse and divided
the Arab community,'' he said.
   Also Tuesday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir sharply rejected a
request to free Mubarak Awad until the Arab-American is to be
deported Sunday, Israel army radio said.
   The Supreme Court last Sunday upheld a government deportation
order issued last month against Awad, who advocates non-violent
resistance to the Israeli occupation.
   The radio said Awad's lawyer Avraham Gal asked Shamir to release
him from jail and place him under house arrest until his deportation
as a good-will gesture.
   Shamir aide Tzahi Hanegbi wrote Gal that Awad's release from jail
could lead to violent disturbances, the radio said.

   Robert Flint Chandler Jr., developer of a
worldwide agricultural research network which has increased the
availability of food for billions of people, was named Tuesday to
receive the $200,000 General Foods World Food Prize.
   ``This was a total surprise to me,'' Chandler said of the award
given to recognize outstanding achievement in improving the
quantity, quality or availability of food on a significant world
scale.
   Chandler, who will celebrate his 81st birthday on June 22, told a
news conference that world governments must ``support and strengthen
... the connection between the research worker, the extension worker
(in the field) and the farmer'' to increase world food production.
   ``We must meet the farmer where he is,'' he said, noting that
``the farmer is not very often the limiting factor'' in the success
of agricultural programs in foreign lands.
   Instead, Chandler said, ``it's the extension agent who wants to
make sure it's the right thing he's recommending or government
officials who aren't ready to support (new agricultural)
innovations.''
   Chandler, who was chosen from a field of 125 nominees from 39
nations, will receive his cash award and an original sculpture by
Saul Bass during a ceremony at the Smithsonian Institution on Oct. 4.
   The prize, first awarded in 1987, is funded by the General Foods
Fund Inc, a non-profit arm of General Foods Corp. of Ryebrook, N.Y.
   As the founding director of the Philippines-based International
Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Chandler oversaw the development of
high-yielding varieties of rice in the 1950s and 1960s that helped
form the basis for the green revolution in Asia.
   ``The single most important thing I did was to help establish
IRRI, to hire competent scientists, to stimulate them, lead them
into productivity along practical lines of getting increased food
production and not having them go off theoretical lines,'' he said.
   The research developments at IRRI are credited with averting a
major famine in Asia in the 1970s. The center became the
institutional model for 12 other agricultural stations around the
world.
   Chandler, a Columbus, Ohio native who now lives in Raymond,
Maine, served as president of the University of New Hampshire from
1947 to 1954 before turning to full-time agricultural research.

<TEXT>
   Former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali
and Attorney General Edwin Meese III welcomed aboard a new Justice
Department aide Tuesday and Meese declared that the department,
riddled in recent months with key departures, is ``in good shape.''
   The unlikely lineup of Ali and Meese came about because the
former fighter recommended University of Virginia law professor
Stephen Saltzburg for a job at the Justice Department. Saltzburg was
named as a deputy in the department's criminal division.
   Ali got to know Saltzburg when the ex-fighter spoke to one of
Saltzburg's classes on campus about Ali's 1967 conviction for draft
evasion. Ali had sought an exemption from the military draft on
religious grounds.
   Ali called Saltzburg ``a brilliant and compassionate man'' who
would be an excellent addition to the Justice Department ``because
of his character and his background as an expert in criminal law.''
   At a ceremony in the office of Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who
recommended Saltzburg to the attorney general, Meese said that with
Saltzburg's appointment, the department has ``a new team'' in place
and ``we're in good shape.''
   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and the former criminal
division chief, William Weld, resigned in protest March 29 along
with two of Weld's aides over Meese's continued tenure at the
Justice Department in the face of an ongoing criminal investigation
of the attorney general. Saltzburg will supervise the narcotics and
dangerous drug section and four other offices.
   Asked whether he was concerned his reputation might be tainted by
Meese's legal problems, Saltzburg replied: ``People will judge me on
the basis of what I do.''
   He said he felt ``very confident'' about the department's
positions on important issues on which he will work, mainly the war
on drugs.
   Saltzburg will be a deputy to acting Assistant Attorney General
Edward S.G. Dennis, the former U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, who
took over Weld's post last week.
   Saltzburg has been a consultant to Herb Stern, a former federal
judge and ex-U.S. attorney who was hired by independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh to represent the Iran-Contra prosecutor on the
issue of congressional immunity.

   The New Orleans woman who says evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart paid her to perform sexual acts said Tuesday that she has
given up prostitution and plans to go back to Indiana to finish high
school and raise her children.
   But first 28-year-old Debra Murphree will make a 14-day, 10-city
tour to promote the July issue of Penthouse magazine, which contains
her description of her dates with Swaggart and photos that
illustrate some of the sexual poses she says the television preacher
paid her to assume.
   At a news conference at Penthouse's New York office, Miss
Murphree described Swaggart as ``very attractive'' but said he was
``just another customer to me. All I wanted was the money.''
   She would not discuss how much the magazine paid her for her
story.
   Swaggart, head of the Baton Rouge-based Jimmy Swaggart World
Ministries, has never admitted a sexual encounter but said from the
pulpit Feb. 1 that he was guilty of a sin against his family. He
stopped preaching for three months but resumed in May despite losing
his credentials from the Assemblies of God, the nation's largest
Pentecostal denomination.
   Miss Murphree said that after the tour she would return to
Princeton, Ind., and her children _ a daughter, 10, and two sons, 7
and 8 _ who are staying with her parents.
   She said she had no plans beyond getting a high school diploma,
but thought she might try something like interior decorating.

   The principal critic of House Speaker Jim
Wright's ethics said Tuesday that he too has used a member of his
congressional staff to work on a book he was writing prior to its
publication.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who asked the House ethics committee
last month to investigate Wright, said he is ``fairly confident''
that he asked then-administrative assistant Frank Gregorsky to
review his book, ``Window of Opportunity,'' before it was published
in 1984.
   ``There is clearly a distinction between (using staff on)
legitimate public policy efforts, which may include books and
speeches, which I suspect virtually every member of the Congress
does,'' Gingrich said in a telephone interview.
   ``We all ask our staffs to critique it, to look at it, to make
sure it's all right.''
   Matthew Cossolotto, a former aide to Wright, said in interviews
this week that he spent 150 to 200 hours while on the Texas
Democrat's staff working on Wright's book, ``Reflections of a Public
Man.''
   House records show that Cossolotto also was paid $2,078 from
official congressional accounts to cover his expenses during a 1984
trip to Texas when he oversaw the final editing of the book.
   Wright has refused to comment on the matter since Sunday, when he
defended Cossolotto's assignment during a telephone interview with
The Washington Post. He canceled his regular daily news briefing
Tuesday and denied an Associated Press request for an interview on
the subject.
   Cossolotto's role in the production of Wright's book did not
become public until after Gingrich asked for the ethics committee
investigation into Wright's personal financial dealings.
   But the Georgia congressman said Tuesday he thinks the ethics
panel also should examine whether Wright violated House rules by
assigning Cossolotto to work on the book.
   ``The idea of using 200 hours, of having it be your only job
assignment, of charging over $2,000 for a trip which a staffer says
was only for the purpose of going to Fort Worth in order to write
the book, it seems to me that's clearly wrong,'' he said.
   Gingrich said Gregorsky's only role in his own book was reviewing
the manuscript before it was published. He said he wrote the first
draft himself and the final draft was done with help from his wife
and a professional writer who was paid by the publisher.
   In a related development, aides said Tuesday that Gingrich has
begun using his role in the ethics campaign against Wright to raise
money for GOPAC, a political action committee that supports
conservative candidates for state offices.
   Gingrich, who is general chairman of GOPAC, sent a fund-raising
letter June 1 seeking $75 contributions ``to help us keep the heat
on the Democrats and make the gains we need this November.''
   The letter also included a postcard for recipients to send to
Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the House ethics committee,
urging the panel to launch an investigation of Wright.
   Wright's book was the subject of part of Gingrich's complaint to
the ethics committee. He asked the panel to investigate reports that
Wright was receiving unusually high royalties of 55 percent for the
book, which was published by a company which received more than
$250,000 for services to Wright's re-election campaign in 1985-86.
   Carlos Moore, whose company published the book, said Tuesday that
it had a press run of 20,000 and is sold out. He said most copies
were sold directly by his company for $5.95 each, with Wright
receiving $3.25 and the company $2.70.
   Some copies of the book, however, were sold to bookstores for $3,
Moore said, and Wright received only $1 per book royalties on those.
   In the interview with the Post, Wright responded to reports that
lobbyists had purchased multiple copies of the book by saying he
would be glad to have Moore provide a list of the purchasers.
   But Moore said he had no such list available, although he
speculated that ``very few'' were sold to bookstores.
   ``If I had to guess how many we sold to bookstores, I'd say
between 2,000 and 3,000,'' he said. ``Why take in $3 when I can take
in $5.95?''

   Four teen-agers who tumbled over a 100-foot
cliff beside the Mississippi River early Tuesday were running down a
dark path that led over the edge, police said.
   Troy Meyer, 16, of Dubuque, died after the four plunged over the
cliff shortly after midnight near the Julien Dubuque monument, which
overlooks the river and Catfish Creek, the Dubuque County Sheriff's
Department said.
   Craig Haverland, 15, and Carl Fink, 17, both of Cuba City, Wis.,
and Jolene Schmitt, 14, of Dubuque, were injured.
   Haverland and Fink were listed in serious condition Tuesday at
the intensive care unit of Mercy Hospital in Dubuque.
   Schmitt fell into some trees and scrambled to nearby rocks. She
was in satisfactory condition.
   ``They thought they were on a path leading down and it was
leading right to the edge of the cliff,'' sheriff's Capt. Milt
Chapman said. ``For some reason, they just took off running. When
one of them tripped, the rest just tumbled right over the top of
him.''
   Chapman said he did not know if the four had been drinking. The
monument area is a favorite place for teens to go and drink, Chapman
said.
   Police were hampered in piecing together what happened because
they had not talked to Haverland and Fink, and managed to speak only
briefly with Miss Schmitt.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Prosecutor Accused of Illegally Using Free Legal Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three conservatives filed a complaint Tuesday
against independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, saying the
Iran-Contra prosecutor may have violated federal criminal law when
he accepted free legal services from Harvard law professor Laurence
Tribe.
   Tribe, at Walsh's behest, wrote a brief in support of another
independent counsel, Alexia Morrison, who is seeking to have the
Supreme Court reverse a federal appeals court decision which
declared that independent counsels are unconstitutional.
   The criminal complaint filed with the Justice Department's
criminal division says Walsh may have violated the Anti-Deficiency
Act, which makes it unlawful for a government employee to accept
voluntary services from private individuals.
   Walsh said his office had researched the question and concluded
there was no violation, and that his office was checking with the
Justice Department on the matter.
   The complaint was filed by three men, including F. Andy Messing
Jr., executive director of the National Defense Council Foundation.
Messing is a conservative activist who worked with fired National
Security Council aide Oliver L. North in attempts to aid the Contras.
   The complaint asks the Justice Department to look into the free
services of Tribe and calls for appointment of an independent
counsel to conduct a criminal investigation.
   The maximum penalty for violating the Anti-Deficiency Act is two
years imprisonment and a $5,000 fine.
   The others filing the complaint were Kenneth Boehm, treasurer of
the Conservative Campaign Fund, and Peter Flaherty, chairman of
Citizens for Reagan.
   ``We have carefully researched this issue and are satsified that
there is no violation whatever of the Anti-Deficiency Act,'' Walsh
said in a statement.
   ``We have communicated this conclusion to the Justice Department,
which has expressed no disagreement and has sought the views of its
office of legal counsel,'' Walsh added.
   The Citizens for Reagan group issued a statement quoting Boehm as
saying ``Walsh has sought to privatize our judicial process.''
   Flaherty said that ``one must question the financial
arrangements'' in which Walsh is allowing senior staff lawyers to
retain their relationships with private law firms. Flaherty said
this has created ``the potential for huge conflicts of interest.''
   A spokesman for Walsh, Jim Wieghart, said a special panel screens
potential conflicts of interest and that ``we're aware of none.''
   Wieghart said Walsh tried to get the most qualified lawyers
possible for his investigation and acknowledged that some have come
to work on a part-time basis.

<HEAD>Governent Ordered to Grant Visas to Four Barred Due to Communist
Affiliations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday ordered the government
to grant visas to Nicaragua's interior minister and three others
barred from entering the country because of their membership in
communist or communist-affiliated groups.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, reversing an earlier
finding that had been set aside by a federal appeals court, ruled
that Nicaraguan Interior Minister Tomas Borge, two Cuban officials
and a former Italian senator should be admitted to accept speaking
engagements at the invitation of U.S. citizens.
   Greene held that the State Department had violated the 1952
Immigration and Nationality Act by denying the four visas simply
because the applicants were members of communist or
communist-affiliated organizations.
   The law authorizes the State Department to exclude aliens if a
consular official determines they would engage in activities during
a visit that ``would be prejudicial to the public interest'' or
endanger the safety of citizens.
   The State Department had invoked the 1952 law saying that visits
by Borge, former Italian senator Nino Pasti and Cuban officials
Leonor Rodriguez Lezcano and Olga Finlay would be prejudicial to
U.S. interests.
   Borge had been invited in 1983 to speak by members of Congress,
university professors and religious leaders, but the State
Department said his presence in the country would be ``highly
prejudicial to the foreign policy interests of the United States.''
   To keep Pasti out, the government cited his membership in the
World Peace Council, a group it considered controlled by the Soviet
government, and said his speech to a nuclear disarmament rally on
Boston would merely advance Soviet interests.
   The two Cuban women had been delegates to the U.N. Commission on
the Statute of Women and were invited by New York City to attend a
conference on the subject.
   The American Civil Liberties Union argued that to bar someone,
the law requires the State Department to determine that an alien's
proposed activities during the visit _ as opposed to political
affiliations _ would endanger U.S. interests.
   Greene originally sided with the government's application of the
law, but a divided panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
reversed his 1984 ruling.
   The appellate court finding was upheld last fall on a 3-3 vote by
the Supreme Court, which did not issue an opinion.
   The appellate panel ordered Greene to determine if Congress had
acquiesced to a longstanding State Department practice of refusing
visas to individuals simply because their mere presence in the
country would hurt national interests.
   ``In the opinion of this court, the government has failed in this
task,'' Greene said in Tuesday's ruling. ``The court finds that the
evidence of administrative acquiesence is only imperceptibly more
weighty than it was when these cases were before the court in 1984.''
   Arthur Eisenberg, an ACLU lawyer in New York who worked on the
case, said Greene's ruling means ``you can't penalize individuals
for their associational activities, for their expression and for
their ideology.''
   ``We believe the statute looked to conduct,'' he said.

   Two Soviet cosmonauts and a Bulgarian rocketed into
space Tuesday on the first manned flight of 1988, riding a column of
orange flame on live television, courtesy of Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and ``glasnost.''
   Alexander Alexandrov, 36, from the Bulgarian town of Omurtag, had
waited more than nine years for the flight. The Soyuz TM-5 space
capsule lifted off at 6:03 p.m. Moscow time (10:03 a.m. EDT) from
the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia.
   The broadcast on state television showed flames spewing from a
Vostok rocket booster to lift the capsule into a nearly cloudless
blue sky.
   ``I feel excellent,'' Alexandrov said from inside the capsule
seconds after the launch. The shot, in black and white, showed him
in cramped quarters.
   About two minutes into the flight, the first stage of the booster
dropped away and plummeted toward the earth.
   Before Gorbachev became the Soviet leader, with his ``glasnost''
policy of openness in selected areas, launches customarily were
broadcast only when successful and only on tape, after the fact.
   Tuesday's live coverage lasted more than an hour, and other media
also featured the story.
   Tass carrried 10 reports on the launch and the Soviet manned
space program. The Soviet program thrives, while U.S. manned flights
stalled after January 1986 explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger, which killed seven astronauts.
   Several other Soviet manned missions are planned for this year,
including crew members from France and Afghanistan.
   During the broadcast Tuesday, Alexandrov's family was shown in
Bulgaria watching the launch on a television screen set up on a
street.
   ``I wish him a happy journey and a safe return, like any
mother,'' his mother told a television reporter minutes after the
launch.
   The broadcast showed cheering, waving crowds in the streets.
Bulgaria's defense minister was among the dignitaries watching at
Baikonur in the republic of Kazakhstan.
   Alexandrov and cosmonauts Viktor P. Savinykh, 48, and Anatoly Y.
Solovyov, 40, are scheduled to dock Thursday with the space station
Mir, whose name means Peace in Russian.
   Already aboard are cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov,
the last men to enter space. They reached the station Dec. 23.
   In a 10-day mission, the five men are to conduct about 40
experiments, some using Bulgarian equipment. Tass, the official news
agency, said they involve space physics, remote sensing of Earth,
space biology and medicine.
   Among items the new cosmonauts are taking to the Mir is an orchid
grown on Earth from seeds planted on the space station, the agency
said.
   Viktor A. Svirin, a shift director at the Soviet Mission Control
Center in Kaliningrad, northeast of Moscow, told reporters the Mir's
amenities include a a videocassette recorder with which the
cosmonauts can watch movies.
   The last Bulgarian-Soviet flight, in April 1979, was marred by a
failed attempt to dock with the Salyut space station. The Bulgarian
cosmonaut on that flight, Georgy Ivanov, told Soviet television this
time he had one wish for Alexandrov: that he only hear the word
``normal'' during his mission.
   Ivanov got his wish. Mission Control said repeatedly that all
systems on the Soyuz TM-5 were operating normally.
   Alexandrov was the backup Bulgarian for the 1979 mission. He had
trained for this flight since last year.

<TEXT>
   President Najib of Afghanistan said Tuesday
more than 34,000 Soviet soldiers _ about 30 percent of the total _
have been withdrawn but the pace may be slowed if Pakistan continues
arming Afghan insurgents.
   ``If the Pakistani side does not ... end interference in the
internal affairs of Afghanistan from its territory, Afghanistan
reserves its right to react to this in a manner warranted,'' Najib,
who uses only one name, said in a speech to a special General
Assembly session on disarmament.
   He did not elaborate in the speech, but told a news conference
later: ``We want to visualize an optimistic situation ... but should
such violations acquire a permanent character ... in such a case we
would certainly renew our consideration on the schedule of
withdrawal and take proper reactions, together with the Soviet
Union.''
   Najib added, however, that his government intends to meet the
troop withdrawal schedule set by the Geneva agreement with Pakistan,
which requires all Soviet soldiers to be out within nine months of
May 15.
   In his first speech to the General Assembly, delivered in the
Dari language, Najib accused Pakistani authorities and Afghan
guerrillas of hindering the voluntary return of Afghan refugees to
their homeland.
   ``Such actions are sheer violations of the letter and spirit of
the Geneva accords and an affront to the United Nations,'' he said.
   ``They in Islamabad will be gravely mistaken should they think
that only one part of the Geneva accords, the return of the Soviet
troops, will be implemented and the other parties will not live up
to their commitments,'' Najib said.
   About 5.5 million people, roughly one-third of the population,
have fled Afghanistan in 10 years of civil war _ more than 3 million
to Pakistan and 2 million to Iran.
   The U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 in Geneva requires
the Soviets to withdraw the more than 100,000 Red Army soldiers who
have been helping fight Moslem rebels in Afghanistan.
   Soviet officials also have threatened to slow the withdrawal.
   In a statement May 28 announcing that 10,000 soldiers had left
Afghanistan, the Soviet Foreign Ministry said the pullout could slow
if the United States kept delivering ``lavish supplies'' to the
rebels.
   Najib spoke to the General Assembly disarmament session for 30
minutes, devoting most of his remarks to the situation in
Afghanistan. He again called for national reconciliation and
establishment of a coalition government, including opposition forces.
   He said the death toll in the war was 243,900 soldiers and
civilians, including 35,700 women and 20,700 children. He said
77,700 people have been wounded.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after a Communist
coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in
December 1979.
   The insurgents were not involved in the Geneva negotiations.
Leaders of the seven-party guerrilla coalition have said they would
ignore the agreement and continue fighting.

   New Afghan Prime Minister Mohammad
Hasan Sharq announced his 24-member Cabinet on Tuesday, state-run
Radio Kabul reported.
   Sharq, who replaced Sultan Ali Keshtmand on May 26, presented his
Cabinet to the National Assembly while President Najib was in New
York to address a United Nations special assembly on disarmament.
Before leaving, however, Najib issued a decree naming four vice
presidents to serve under Sharq.
   The time gap between Sharq's appointment and formation of a
government fueled speculation that Najib faced a deep split within
the governing People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. Najib is
trying to hold together his Parcham faction, divided between loyalty
to him and to former President Babrak Karmal.
   Sharq's Cabinet returns Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoi, leader of the
party's opposition Khalq wing, to the Interior Ministry although
diplomatic reports said Najib has been trying to push Gulabzoi out
of the government.
   Afghanistan's negotiator at the Geneva peace talks, Abdul Wakil,
was returned as foreign minister. The talks resulted in the April 14
accord under which the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in
Afghanistan are to leave for home.

<HEAD>Toxic Wastes From Italy Dumped in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,400 tons of toxic waste from Italy
have been dumped in Lebanon, maritime authorities revealed Tuesday.
   The poisonous chemicals were shipped to Lebanon in containers and
barrels to be dumped in the Kesrouan coastal strip, about 20 miles
north of the capital city of Beirut, the authorities said.
   Some of the waste material was left in barrels in the Kesrouan
area, authorities said. Some reports say part of the shipment was
buried in that region.
   Raymond Farhat, director of the Marine Transport Authority, told
reporters investigations were under way to determine how the
chemicals entered Lebanon.
   The Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., a Christian TV station, said
Monday a Lebanese importer, identified only as Haddad, concluded an
agreement with an Italian chemical firm for bringing the waste into
Lebanon.
   Christian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Lebanon's telecommunications authority intercepted a message from
the importer to his Italian agent demanding $500,000 for his
services.
   Interior Minister Abdullah Rassi said the waste was being
examined to see if it was radioactive.
   The reports came as the Syrian freighter Zanooria was docked in
Genoa, Italy, waiting to unload more than 2,000 tons of unidentified
industrial waste that first sailed from Italy last year. Various
countries refused to accept the wastes.

<HEAD>Snow Falls In West; Storm Rips Through Delaware</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell in northern California and northwest Nevada Tuesday,
and a severe storm demolished trailers, downed trees and caused
power outages in Delaware, while much of the rest of the nation had
another hot day.
   At elevations as low as 3,500 feet in the Mount Shasta area and
5,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada and Lake Tahoe areas along the
California-Nevada border, up to 5 inches of snow fell, the National
Weather Service reported.
   Most of the roads were free of snow, but the weather service
expected some of the snow to stick to the roads later Tuesday,
especially above 7,000 feet. In the lower elevations, rain was
scattered.
   By contrast, record high temperatures were set near the Canadian
border from eastern Montana to Michigan and from Ohio across the
Carolinas to Florida.
   Sunshine prevailed across most of the nation, but showers and
thunderstorms reached from western New York to eastern Pennsylvania
and parts of New Jersey. Showers and thunderstorms were widespread
over Florida and reached into parts of the central Gulf Coast region.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect Tuesday evening for
parts of southern and eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey,
much of Maryland and all of Delaware, as well as for much of
northern Montana.
   A severe storm ripped through part of southern Delaware Tuesday
between 4 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., before heading out to the Delaware Bay
and the Atlantic Ocean, according to the National Weather Service.
   The storm caused injuries and demolished trailers as well as
knocking trees onto power lines, authorities said. The heaviest
damage appeared to be in the Smyrna and Woodland Beach areas, just
north of Dover, where residents said they saw a tornado.
   Continued dry weather led officials from Chicago to Southern
Illinois to place limits on water use, and left farmers wondering
when rain would fall.
   A band of cool temperatures extended across extreme northern
Michigan, much of New York state and New England. Afternoon readings
in these areas were mostly in the 60s and lower 70s.
   The weather service said some patchy frost may occur Tuesday and
Wednesday nights in some of the higher mountain valleys of Vermont
and eastern New York.
   Record high temperatures for the date were set in Bismarck, N.D.,
96; Dickinson, N.D., 95; Flint, Mich., 93; Glasgow, Mont., 100;
Greer, S.C., 93; Hatteras, N.C., 90; Miami, 93; Rapid City, S.D.,
100; Williston, N.D., 102; Wilmington N.C., 96; Youngstown, Ohio, 88.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Truckee, Calif., to 102 degrees at Williston, N.D., and
Sidney, Mont. The nation's low Tuesday morning was 28 degrees at
Austin, Nev., and Truckee, Calif.
   The weather service predicted scattered showers and thunderstorms
Wednesday reaching from southern New Jersey and southeast
Pennsylvania across the mid-Atlantic states and the eastern parts of
the Carolinas to Florida and southern Alabama. Widely scattered
thunderstorms were forecast from eastern Kansas and southwest
Missouri to eastern Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas. Showers and a
few thunderstorms were expected to extend from Montana to the
Pacific Northwest.
   The weather service forecast highs in the 80s and 90s over most
of the nation. Temperatures should hold in the 60s and 70s from the
Great Lakes region across Pennsylvania and New York to New Jersey
and southern New England, and only reach the 50s over portions of
northern New England. Temperatures of more than 100 degrees were
expected over parts of southwest Texas.

   Instructors could have known about a
recruit's fear of the water and his counseling before they allegedly
forced him back into the water and he died, according to evidence
introduced Tuesday.
   The evidence consisted of records that include a counseling sheet
filled out Feb. 3 when Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki tried to drop out.
He died March 2 at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   Mirecki wrote that he had a bad experience in the water as a
child, an apparent reference to his near drowning at age 5 when his
brother threw him into the water and then rescued him.
   ``I don't want to go through that again,'' Mirecki wrote. ``I
believe being a rescue swimmer is a great job, but not for me.''
   The evidence was produced during a hearing to determine whether
five rescue-swimmer school instructors and their commanding officer
should face court-martial in the death of the 19-year-old recruit
from Appleton, Wis.
   Testimony ended late Tuesday afternoon, and closing arguments
were scheduled Wednesday.
   Other records show that Mirecki had been placed on hold for a
psychological follow-up examination Feb. 4.
   Chief Petty Officer Daniel J. Conway, student control chief at
the school, testified the records were on file and that instructors
and the officer-in-charge, Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, had access to them.
   Torchia is charged with dereliction of duty. The instructors are
charged with involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit
battery. They are Petty Officers 1st Class Richard E. Blevins and
David J. Smith and Petty Officers 2nd Class John W. Zelenock,
Frankie D. Deaton and Michael W. Combe.
   Earlier testimony indicated a flight surgeon had declared Mirecki
medically unfit for the course a month before he died because he was
suffering from a phobia of being pulled under water. He was sent
back to the school after a clinical psychologist disagreed with the
diagnosis.
   On the day he died, Mirecki scrambled from the pool and said he
wanted to quit the course. This was during an exercise in which
instructors, acting the part of victims about to drown, grabbed
students in headlocks from which they were supposed to extricate
themselves and save the victims.
   Testimony indicates Mirecki was forced back into the pool, then
was pried away from a rope in the water and taken to the deep end
where he collapsed.
   A pathologist testified Monday that Mirecki literally was scared
to death because of his phobia, which triggered heart failure and
drowning.
   Other evidence introduced Tuesday included a statement by Petty
Officer John Bilinsky, an instructor-in-training, that defendant
Combe had Mirecki in a headlock when the recruit passed out.
   ``I'm not going to say it's incorrect,'' Bilinsky said, although
earlier in his testimony he said he had trouble remembering exactly
what happened.
   At a news conference Tuesday in Appleton, U.S. Rep. Toby Roth,
R-Wis., accused the Navy of ``stonewalling'' in the investigation of
Mirecki's death and called upon the Navy to release key reports on
the case.
   Roth said he will seek to amend an appropriations bill next week,
calling for a study on how the Navy can revamp its training to
improve safety.

<HEAD>Justice Issues New Guidelines for International Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Tuesday proposed new
antitrust guidelines for international operations that generally
give greater flexibility to U.S. and foreign firms to engage in
cooperative ventures.
   The draft would replace guidelines issued more than a decade ago,
which have become ``badly outdated'' due to changes in federal law,
developments in case law and changes in economic thinking, said
Charles Rule, assistant attorney general for the Justice
Department's antitrust division.
   The 1977 guidelines were ``very restrictive and hostile'' to
intellectual property licensing agreements, said Rule. Under the new
guidelines, such agreements won't be challenged unless it is found
they will drastically raise prices to consumers or unduly restrict
output.
   The 1977 guidelines provided an ``ill-defined analysis'' for what
types of joint ventures were permitted, said Rule, who contended
that the proposal provides a ``structured approach.''
   A summary of the draft guidelines says that joint research and
development, technology licensing restrictions and vertical
non-price distribution arrangements ``often are not
anti-competitive, and often substantially benefit U.S. consumers.''
   ``The most important thing the new guidelines do is provide
certainty and clarity in the law, which reduces the cost of
international transactions and increases the competitve ability of
U.S. firms and ultimately enhances the welfare of U.S. consumers,''
Rule said.
   The proposed guidelines contain 17 hypothetical cases of ways in
which the new policies would apply.
   The new guidelines say the Justice Department's top enforcement
priority in the antitrust area internationally remains the
prosecution of ``naked'' cartel arrangements among competitors
engaging in price-fixing and bid-rigging agreements.

<HEAD>The Moody Blues Say Retirement Not In Their Vocabulary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moody Blues say they have no plans to retire,
with their 13th album to be released next week and more than 50
million records sold worldwide since the band formed in the 1960s.
   ``We might go on forever,'' lead singer Justin Hayward said in an
interview Tuesday. ``There is no such thing as retirement as far as
we are concerned. After all, what would we do then?''
   The group's five members now are in their 40s. Their latest
album, ``Sur la Mer, (On the Sea)'' is due to be released Monday.
   ``This is not a job to us,'' said bass player John Lodge. ``It is
a way of life, and as soon as we retired from the way of life, it
would all be over for us. We may still be going at 80 _ well, why
stop at 80?''
   The Moody Blues began their career in Birmingham in 1964, quickly
rising to fame with hits like ``Nights in White Satin,'' which
entered the pop charts three times and spent 33 weeks there. ``Go
Now'' was the No. 1 single in Britain in December 1964.

   A car bomb exploded Tuesday near a Syrian
military checkpoint in south Beirut and touched off fighting between
Syrian troops and pro-Iranian militiamen, police said. At least six
people were killed.
   The blast in the seaside district of Ouzai killed four people and
wounded 39, including two Syrian soldiers and two Lebanese
policemen, police said. Two more people died and another was injured
in the gunfight.
   The explosion occurred at 4:05 p.m. about 100 yards from an
office of the Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of
God. It was the third car bombing in Lebanon this year.
   A gray Renault loaded with Hezbollah gunmen raced to the scene
after the explosion, but dozens of Syrian soldiers and Lebanese
policemen surrounding the site stopped the car and ordered its
occupants out, police said.
   The Syrians and Lebanese were manning a nearby Syrian military
checkpoint.
   ``When the gunmen refused to step out, troops and policemen tried
to haul them out by force. One gunman fired his pistol, and a
shoot-out erupted in which two gunmen were killed and a civilian
passer-by was wounded,'' said a police spokesman. He spoke on
condition of anonymity, in keeping with regulations.
   Syria deployed about 2,400 troops in south Beirut last month to
quell fighting between Hezbollah and the rival pro-Syrian Shiite
Amal militia for control of the area. Most of the 18 foreigners
kidnapped in Lebanon are believed held in south Beirut.
   One of the slain gunmen was identified as Abu Ali Assaf, a
Hezbollah official.
   Reporters and photographers watching from a distance saw troops
and policemen beating the gunmen with rifle butts through the car's
open windows before the shooting began.
   One gunman was seen drawing a pistol and firing at the officers,
who opened fire with submachine guns. Panicked onlookers fled.
   The brown Datsun, loaded with 33 pounds of explosives, was parked
outside an automobile repair shop.
   The shop owner, Hussein Jammal, who was wounded in the blast,
told police the young man who left the car told him he wanted its
radiator repaired and he would be back to pick it up.
   ``The man walked away. Minutes afterwards, the car exploded and I
saw blood all over me. I looked around for the man, but there was no
trace of him,'' Jammal said as policemen helped him into an
ambulance.
   The wail of sirens resounded across the city as victims were
rushed to hospitals. Fire engines doused two burning cars with water
hoses.
   Debris from four damaged shops was quickly removed by Syrian
soldiers and Lebanese policemen. So were at least six other wrecked
cars.
   The bombing came eight days after a car bomb detonated in
Christian east Beirut's Rmaeil residential neighborhood, killing 20
people and wounding 78.
   That blast raised fears that Lebanon's Moslems and Christians
have launched a new round of car bombings.
   The first car bomb in 1988 blew up April 23 in a packed vegetable
market in Lebanon's predominantly Sunni Moslem port city of Tripoli,
killing 69 people and wounding 111.
   There was no claim of responsibility for any of the three
bombings. But Tripoli leaders blamed the explosion in their city on
the Lebanese Forces Christian militia.
   The Lebanese Forces command denied resonsibility. It accused the
Syrian secret service of masterminding the Rmaeil car bombing.
   The Times of London on Tuesday quoted Shiite and Sunni Moslem
sources in Beirut as saying that the United States, Britain and West
Germany have initiated direct contacts with the Iranians in an
effort to free foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   There are nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon. The hostage
held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Two Beirut newspapers, An-Nahar and As-Safir, published a letter
in Arabic to Anderson on Tuesday, the third birthday of his daughter
Sulome, whom he has never seen.
   ``Her only wish is to see you and be with you,'' Sulome's mother,
Madeleine, said in the letter. ``She knows that ... you want to be
with her, but that you can't do that yet.''

<HEAD>Spectators Scuffle With Officer, Get Arrested Outside Hearing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two spectators at a court hearing on conditions
at a federal prison in Kentucky were held Tuesday on charges they
assaulted a U.S. marshal.
   The two men, believed to be supporters of a prisoner who
testified at the hearing, were arrested after they scuffled with a
deputy U.S. marshal outside the courtroom of U.S. District Judge
Barrington Parker, according to federal law enforcement authorities.
   The incident occurred while Parker was conducting a hearing on a
lawsuit challenging conditions at a high-security isolation unit for
a half-dozen women prisoners at the Federal Correctional Institution
in Lexington, Ky.
   Parker had heard testimony about prison conditions from prisoner
Susan Rosenberg, identified by law enforcement officials as a
left-wing terrorist who is serving a 58-year prison term for
possessing 600 pounds of weapons and explosives.
   Ms. Rosenberg is among seven people recently indicted for placing
a bomb that exploded in the U.S. Capitol in 1983.
   One of the two men in police custody following the hallway
scuffle had refused to stand up when the judge returned from an
afternoon recess, said authorities.
   When asked by Parker why he had not stood up, the man said he did
not respect the authority of the court.
   Authorities said Deputy U.S. Marshal William Pickett was jumped
from behind while escorting the man down a hallway outside Parker's
courtroom.
   Pickett was then punched by the man he was escorting before he
and other courthouse guards subdued his attackers, authorities said.
   The two men, identified only as John Heild and B. Wardlaw, were
being held in the city police lockup Tuesday night on charges they
assaulted a marshal, said authorities, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Ms. Rosenberg and two other inmates, Sylvia Brown and Silvia
Baraldini, charge in the lawsuit brought by the American Civil
Liberties Union that they are being held in the Lexington isolation
unit because of their political beliefs.
   Baraldini was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy in aiding
a bungled $1.6 million robbery of a Brink's armored car in Nyack,
N.Y., that left a guard and two police officers dead in 1981.
   At the unit in Lexington, guards escort the prisoners to and from
the locked cellblock. Prisoners' hands and feet are shackled every
time they leave the unit, Ms. Rosenberg said.
   Ms. Rosenberg, who was in the general populations of two other
federal prisons, said authorities told her she was placed in the
unit in October, 1986 because she was considered a terrorist.
   ``They said I had a one-way ticket,'' she told Parker.
   ``The isolation and the control and the dependency has taken away
any semblance of any kind of self-determination about my life,'' Ms.
Rosenberg said. ``Nobody should have that happen to them, no matter
what they've been convicted of. That's punishment on punishment.''
   ``I really think that in prison you can't control all aspects of
your life,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ``But when you can't control
anything at any level, that's out of your hands, the frustration is
really unbearable.''
   Ms. Rosenberg said the isolation and strict control by guards has
inflicted severe emotional and psychological stress.
   ``Trying to suppress the anger asks an enormous amount of energy,
an enormous amount of self-control and it's making me sick,'' she
said.
   Dr. William Logan, a psychiatrist hired by the government to
inspect the prison, testified that he found no evidence that
conditions had caused any unusual emotional or psychological damage.
But Logan said his findings were based only on observations and
conversations with prison doctors because the prisoners refused to
talk to him.
   Federal authorities contend that the extra security is required
to protect the facility from terrorist attack. They said they plan
to move the unit to a prison in Mariana, Fla., in July.
   J. Michael Quinlan, director of the Bureau of Prisons, in a 1987
letter to the House Judiciary Committee, denied that inmates are
sent to the unit because of political beliefs.
   But affiliation with groups that use violence in ``attempts to
disrupt or overthrow the government of the United States, or whose
published ideology includes advocating law violations in order to
`free' prisoners is a factor,'' he said.
   Last weekend, Lynette Alice ``Squeaky'' Fromme, convicted of
trying to shoot President Ford on Sept 5, 1975 in Sacramento,
Calif., was transferred to the unit last weekend, authorities said.

   A man went on a rampage Tuesday in a road
grader and badly damaged at least three planes at the airport here
before he was shot by police and sheriff's deputies, authorities
said.
   The man, identified as Randy LaComb of Anaheim, was shot several
times below the waist, said Jim Bryant, spokesman for the San
Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.
   No other injuries were reported.
   LaComb, 37, was airlifted to San Bernardino County Hospital where
he was listed in stable condition, Bryant said.
   Authorities said he was charged with assault with a deadly weapon.
   Police and sheriff's deputies on the ground and a sheriff's
deputy in a helicopter opened fire on the man after he ran into the
side of Flight Craft, a business that gives flight lessons and
refuels planes at the airport. Chino is located about 40 miles east
of Los Angeles.
   LaComb is a construction worker in the area and had access to the
grader, but he took it out of the authorized area on his day off,
another sheriff's spokesman said.
   The chase began in the Chino Hills area, about six miles west of
the airport, after the sheriff's station received a complaint at
9:41 a.m. that someone was operating a road grader in an erratic
manner, Bryant said.
   Chino police detectives began chasing the grader during the
29-minute drive to the airport, during which several people were
nearly hit, he said.
   During the five-minute rampage at the airport, LaComb reportedly
struck three small airplanes and barely missed several people on the
ground.
   The chase ended when the grader's front end was jammed into
Flight Craft's hangar. Police officers and sheriff's deputies opened
fire on the man when he attempted to drive away from the hangar,
Bryant said.
   Jett Reeves, who said he was in Flight Craft's hangar at Chino
Airport when the incident occurred, estimated that LaComb came
within 50 yards of hitting the business's fuel tanks.
   ``It almost looked like the guy in there was laughing,'' Reeves
said. ``He sure looked happy.''

<HEAD>Soviet Journal Criticizes Lenin For Harsh Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet literary journal has taken a new look at
Vladimir I. Lenin, saying the country's founder tried to enforce
tough economic policies by ordering executions and other tough
measures that backfired.
   In a 30-page article in the May edition of Novy Mir (New World),
Vassily Selyunin, takes a more realistic look at Lenin's policies
than the Lenin-can-do-no-wrong approach that has dominated official
Soviet news media for years.
   Selyunin said that in the first few years after the Bolshevik
Revolution in 1917, Lenin favored extremely harsh measures for
putting the economy on track.
   ``The extremes of force, as we see, spread boundlessly: first it
is undertaken for repression of opponents of the revolution, then it
is turned against potential enemies (the Red Terror) and finally, it
becomes a means for solving purely economic tasks,'' Selyunin wrote.
   Selyunin seemed to imply Lenin laid the seeds for the abuses of
power for which his successor, Josef V. Stalin, has been condemned.
   Under Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, historians are being
encouraged to take a more honest look at the country's past. The
result has been numerous press articles, books and films blasting
Stalin, who was responsible for the deaths of millions.
   Gorbachev attacked Stalin's economic policies, under which the
central government tightly controlled production and allowed little
individual initiative.
   The criticism extended to the ``era of stagnation'' under Leonid
I. Brezhnev, who ruled the country from the early 1960s to 1982. But
criticism of Lenin has been off-limits.
   The Novy Mir article says Lenin was mistaken when he abolished
all private property and created a system of forced labor camps.
   Lenin started to go astray in November 1917, when he declared
that ``speculators'' were ``enemies of the people'' who should be
shot when found, according to Selyunin. Speculation meant anything
outside government trade.
   Lenin also advocated another harsh measure, limiting peasant
families to only the bread they needed to make it to the next
harvest, Selyunin wrote. The penalty for violation was a minimum
10-year jail term.
   The author says Lenin might be excused for some of the measures
because the country was suffering severe hunger and destruction.
But, Selyunin wrote, the harsh measures actually made the problems
worse.
   In January 1918, Lenin supported a decree that increased prison
space so ``class enemies'' could be incarcerated.
   But Lenin began to realize he was wrong, and Selyunin quotes him
as saying the use of force was backfiring in that it was increasing
civil unrest, according to the article.
   In March 1921, Lenin made a midcourse correction and had a severe
tax removed from peasants. Two months later he launched his New
Economic Policy, which allowed greater freedom in agriculture,
industry and trade.
   Selyunin credits this program with helping rid the country of
bureaucracy, which Gorbachev has said is stifling some of his
reforms.

<TEXT>
   A jury on Tuesday rejected claims by eight
former residents of Times Beach that dioxin in the oil sprayed on
the town's streets had made them ill.
   The St. Louis Circuit Court jury said, after deliberating a day,
there was no medical evidence to support the claims. The eight
represented more than 180 plaintiffs in the 7-month-old trial.
   Times Beach, a St. Louis County community of 2,400, was
disincorporated and abandoned five years ago because of dioxin
contamination.
   The eight residents whose claims were decided Tuesday had been
chosen by Judge Michael J. Hart as representatives of 184 original
plaintiffs in a suit filed against four chemical companies over
alleged damages. The suit was one of several filed by Times Beach
residents against the companies.
   The test trial was designed to provide guidelines for attorneys
on both sides so that future trials could be handled in as short a
time as possible, Hart said.
   Only two of four chemical companies remained as defendants in the
case. Earlier this month, Syntex USA and Syntex Agribusiness
reportedly settled the case for $14 million to be divided among
1,230 claimants.
   The now-defunct Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical Co. and
Independent Petrochemical Corp. were the remaining defendants.
   An attorney for the plaintiffs, Arnold J. Levin, said a decision
on whether to appeal Tuesday's decision had not yet been made. He
said he would ask the court to allow him to choose eight new
plaintiffs from the original 184 who would more clearly exhibit the
injuries and property losses he said Times Beach residents suffered
from the contamination.
   But defense attorneys expressed confidence that none of the
plaintiffs had illnesses that could be traced to dioxin.
   ``They can pick the eight worst _ seven or eight people from
Times Beach who happen to have cancer _ and I'm confident that we'll
be able to prove that it's in no way connected to dioxin,'' said Ted
Parryman, an attorney for Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical.
   Syntex and its predecessor, Hoffman Taff, made a herbicide known
as Agent Orange at a plant in Verona in southwestern Missouri.
Dioxin is a waste product of Agent Orange, which was used as a
defoliate in Vietnam. Syntex later transferred tanks purportedly
containing the waste material to Northeastern Pharmaceutical.
   Northeastern made hexachlorophene for soaps and toothpaste at the
Verona site, with dioxin a waste product of that chemical as well.
   Attorneys for the plaintiffs said Northeastern passed the waste
on to Independent Petrochemical, which passed it on to Russell
Bliss, the waste hauler who sprayed oil containing the dioxin on the
streets in Times Beach more than 15 years ago to keep the dust down.
Bliss was not a defendant.
   The extent of the contamination in Times Beach was determined in
1982, leading the government to close the city the next year and
relocate its residents.

<HEAD>NASA Anticipates Strong Competition For New Shuttle Boosters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The space agency anticipates strong competition
from prospective manufacturers of the next generation of shuttle
rockets despite a decision by Morton Thiokol, the sole builder of
current solid-fuel boosters, to pull out of the running, a spokesman
said Tuesday.
   Chicago-based Morton Thiokol says it will concentrate on
redesign, for short-term use, of the rocket booster used on
Challenger, which exploded shortly after takeoff Jan. 28, 1986,
killing all seven astronauts aboard.
   According to a presidential commission, the fiery disaster was
caused by hot gas that leaked through a joint in a Thiokol-built
solid-fuel booster, igniting the shuttle's main fuel tank.
   Thiokol may have pulled out of the competition for the $1.2
billion contract to design and build rocket boosters for the 1990s,
but National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials believe
other companies still will be interested.
   ``We're going ahead with this project. We do expect strong
competition for the contract,'' said Jerry Berg, NASA spokesman at
the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. _ the center
that oversees the space agency's rocket work.
   ``Meanwhile, we look forward to our association with Morton
Thiokol on the current booster,'' Berg said.
   NASA plans to use Thiokol's redesigned motor when it resumes
shuttle flights _ the first planned for late August. The redesign is
nearly complete, with a test firing set for next month at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., said Rocky Raab, a Thiokol spokesman in Utah.
   Raab said Monday that United Technologies, a team of Lockheed and
Aerojet and another team consisting of Hercules, Atlantic Research
Corp. and Martin Marietta have expressed an interest in the $1.2
billion contract.
   Tom Fitzgerald, spokesman for Aerojet in Sacramento, Calif., said
Tuesday he was surprised by Thiokol's announcement to pull out, but
said the news was good for Thiokol's competitors.
   ``Any time your field of competitors lessens by one, your chances
improve, obviously,'' Fitzgerald said. ``And yes, we are interested.
   ``It's going to be a competitive contract,'' he added.
``(Thiokol) is a very strong competitor. But as to who is the best
competitor, it's a tough one to say.''
   Berg, meanwhile, said he could not speculate what impact
Thiokol's announcement might have on the competition for the
next-generation version of shuttle boosters _ the advanced solid
rocket motor _ except to say the space agency plans on strong
competition for the project.
   NASA plans to release its formal request for final industry
proposal for the advance rocket later this month, Berg said.
   NASA plans to begin phasing in the advanced rocket in 1994 and
that process is expected to take about four years, meaning Morton
Thiokol will still be involved in providing the current shuttle
rockets for years, Berg said.
   In addition, Thiokol plans to invest $200 million in coming years
to modernize its northern Utah plant in order to seek other space
and defense business, Raab said. The company, which makes and sells
chemicals, rockets and salt, intends to go after the Air Force
advanced launch system, a strap-on booster and other contracts, he
said.

<HEAD>Shamir and Shevardnadze to Meet Thursday</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 13 grafs on Shamir's disarmament speech</NOTE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel
will hold his first meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze on Thursday, an Israeli spokeswoman said.
   Genine Stauber said no exact time and place for the meeting had
been set.
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations after the 1967 Middle
East war but appears to be departing from its policy of not
restoring them until the Israelis give up Arab territories occupied
in the war.
   Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has indicated in recent
speeches that the Soviet Union might resume normal relations after
an international peace conference on the Middle East is convened.
   Shamir leads the right-wing Likud bloc and opposes trading
occupied territory for peace. He also rejects proposals for an
international conference including the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council _ the Soviet Union, United States, China,
Britain and France.
   Those two points are the basis of a U.S. peace plan for the
Middle East, which Secretary of George P. Shultz has been promoting
in the region.
   On Monday, Shamir said Israel will not offer political
concessions for resumption of diplomatic relations with Moscow.
   He and Shevardnadze are in New York to address the 159-member
U.N. General Assembly's special session on disarmament, which began
last week and is to run until June 25. Their governments have had
recent diplomatic contacts at lower levels.
   At Tuesday's disarmament session, Shamir called on Israel's
neighbors to agree to ban nuclear and chemical weapons from the
Middle East but said Israel will not sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   Many delegates from Arab and developing nations left the hall as
Shamir walked to the podium.
   ``As early as 1980, we proposed at the General Assembly of the
United Nations the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in
the Middle East, based on free and direct negotiations between the
states of the region.
   ``We did so in addition to our repeated declaration that Israel
would not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons into the
Middle East,'' he added.
   Israel refuses to say if it has nuclear weapons or the components
to assemble them.
   A former Israeli nuclear technician, Mordechai Vanunu, was
sentenced to prison in Israel for providing photographs of an
Israeli nuclear facility to the Times of London. The newspaper hired
scientists who said the photographs showed Israel had the capacity
to make nuclear weapons.
   Israel does not allow international inspection of its nuclear
plants, a requirement of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   ``Many have urged us to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty,'' said
Shamir. But we have seen that this treaty has, in no way, prevented
wars between its signatories. ... We have repeatedly invited the
Arab states to negotiate the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free
zone, but they have rejected the idea. ... They have refused to
negotiate with us.''
   He condemned the use of chemical weapons and poison gas in the
Iran-Iraq war, singling out Iraq _ ``By its own admission, Iraq has
used this vicious means of indiscriminate killing in its war with
Iran. It is a gross and blatant violation of the Geneva Protocol, to
which Iraq is a signatory.''
   Delegates from Iran or Iraq walked out before Shamir began
speaking.
   Shamir also called for the reduction of conventional forces in
the region.
   He decried the introduction of medium-range missiles in the
Middle East by Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia.
   Shamir was one of about 25 presidents and prime ministers due to
address the special session on disarmament, which opened last week
and is expected to end June 25.

   A federal judge Tuesday indefinitely postponed
the trial of former Teamsters union President Jackie Presser after
doctors said Presser may have six months to live.
   U.S. District Judge George White ordered the postponement after
reviewing letters from four doctors and talking to an Arizona
surgeon at the hospital where Presser is a patient. Presser faces
racketeering and embezzlement charges. White also ruled that two
co-defendants who face payroll padding charges with Presser will
stand trial as scheduled July 12.
   ``Mr. Presser is quite impaired mentally,'' wrote Dr. Leslie
Sheeler of the Cleveland Clinic May 26 in a letter presented to
White. ``He has virtually no short-term memory.
   ``The prognosis with this sort of metastatic tumor is in general
very poor. The expected survival is something like six months.''
   U.S. Attorney William Lynch Tuesday asked White to call Dr.
Robert Spetzler, director of the Barrow Neurological Institute in
Phoenix, Ariz. Presser has been receiving radiation treatment at the
hospital following removal of a cancerous lesion from his brain May
17.
   Spetzler said Presser is being treated with radiation for one
additional brain lesion and may have two others.
   Responding to Lynch's questions by telephone, Spetzler confirmed
the other doctor's diagnosis.
   But Spetzler also said that Presser has shown some improvement
and if he continues to improve, a review in four to six months may
indicate he is competent to stand trial.
   Presser, Anthony Hughes and Harold Friedman are accused of
participating in a $700,000 payroll padding scheme at Teamsters
Local 507 in Cleveland, where Presser is secretary-treasurer.
Presser, 61, relinquished his post as Teamsters president in May
because of his health problems and was replaced by Weldon Mathis,
the union's secretary-treasurer.
   Friedman is Local 507's president and an International Teamsters
vice president. Hughes is the local's secretary.
   Presser's attorney, John Climaco, said Presser wanted the trial
to continue and wants to testify. Climaco said Presser was innocent
and was an FBI informant authorized to hire ``ghost employees,'' who
were listed on the union's payroll but performed no work.

   A van with 18 migrant workers flipped over
after blowing a tire Tuesday, crushing two men to death and injuring
at least a dozen others who were tossed onto Interstate 30,
authorities said.
   One of the men, Moises Ramirez, 18, of Guanajuato, Mexico, said
he heard ``a sound like a rushing tornado, and then the van lost
control, spinning around and turning many times.''
   ``It was a bad scene,'' said Arkansas State Police Cpl. Bobby
Carlton. ``There were bodies laying 75 to 100 feet along the
shoulder of the interstate.''
   The van's occupants were either Mexicans or Mexican-Americans
from Arkansas and Texas en route to a farm north of Prescott,
Carlton said.
   Ramirez, who suffered a fractured arm, said all the workers had
proper legal documents to work in the United States.
   The workers lived on property near Fouke owned by W.H. Lineberry,
who said he heard the van was overloaded because another vehicle in
which some of the men were riding broke down.
   The Chevrolet van has a recommended maximum capacity of 12,
Carlton said.

   Five days before Tammy Wimbley was stabbed to death,
she told police her boyfriend might kill her.
   The boyfriend, Steven Royal, 30, has been charged with
second-degree murder in her killing May 25. He has yet to enter a
plea.
   Teachers at Ms. Wimbley's school in Coral Gables say that despite
five calls to police and visits to two offices, no one would take
down a report on Royal's threats against the 17-year-old.
   ``She wanted help that day,'' said Andrea Loring, assistant
principal at the Academy for Community Education, an alternative
school for students with behavioral or academic problems.
   ``She was angry and hurt enough that she made an attempt to be
not just another abused female,'' Loring said. ``If this guy had
been approached by a policeman, it might have made a difference.''
   Police Chief Clarence Dickson said Ms. Wimbley was a victim of
the system. ``A report should have been made'' by police, he said.
   Detective John Buhrmaster said police will review communications
tapes to determine who handled the calls. ``Somebody should have
been able to help this girl,'' he said.
   Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno said her office will
investigate.
   Ms. Wimbley had dated Royal for three years and in January they
had a baby girl.
   On the Friday before she died, Ms. Wimbley told teachers Royal
had punched her and threatened to kill her because he suspected her
of cheating.
   Ana DeMahy, assistant dean at the school, said she and Ms.
Wimbley made five calls to Miami and Coral Gables police. Each time,
they were referred to another number or told Ms. Wimbley had to file
a report in person.
   Scott Hamilton, a college senior working as an apprentice teacher
at the school, drove Ms. Wimbley to Metro-Dade Police headquarters
and the state attorney's office.
   ``She was crying the whole time,'' Hamilton said. ``She was
terrified. She just wanted protection for that day, to know that it
was on record, that the police knew this man physically abused her.''
   The following Wednesday, Ms. Wimbley was fatally stabbed.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama on Tuesday accused the United States
of trying to nullify the treaties restoring Panamanian sovereignty
over the Canal Zone by the year 2000.
   Panamanian Ambassador Jorge Eduardo Ritter, speaking before the
U.N. General Assembly's special session on disarmament, cited a
``gigantic campaign of aggression unleashed by the government of the
United States against Panama.''
   Ritter claimed the U.S. National Security Council prepared a plan
to destabilize the Panamanian government and thus open a way to
``legally abrogate the (Canal) treaties.''
   Ritter said the alleged plan was drafted April 8, 1986, but he
did not reveal any details on how the Panamanian goverment was
informed about its existence.
   The U.S. government has used economic sanctions to try to force
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega from power. Noriega, who is indicted
in Florida on cocaine trafficking charges, is head of the
15,000-member Defense Forces and de facto ruler of the country.
   Max L. Friedersdorf, a U.S. representative, protested the
Panamanian statement in the General Assembly.
   ``My delegation must protest the attempt by the representative of
Panama to confuse this session and waste this body's valuable time
with inaccurate and unnecessary attacks against the United States,''
said Friedersdorf, alternate representative to the disarmament
session and representative to arms control talks.
   ``The people of Panama and the United States have long enjoyed a
close friendship and working relationship,'' he said. ``The
government and people of the United States sympathize with those
Panamanians who are attempting to restore genuine civilian democracy
to Panama.''
   ``The United States recognizes, however, that it will not be easy
for them to reverse two decades of military control in Panama. The
United States government, of course, remains fully committed to
fulfilling its agreement under the Panama Canal Treaty.''
   The 1977 treaties between the United States and Panama obliges
Washington to hand over to Panama complete control of the waterway
and U.S. military installations by midday Dec. 31, 1999.

<HEAD>Slain DEA Agent Pleaded With Captors to End Beatings, Tapes Reveal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal drug agent pleaded with his Mexican
abductors to stop beating him during interrogation before he was
murdered, according to transcripts of tape recordings filed in
federal court.
   Transcripts of two tapes obtained by Mexican authorites from the
home of reputed drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca-Carrillo were filed
Monday in U.S. District Court as part of the prosecution of three of
the nine men indicted in the murder of Enrique Camarena.
   Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent, was
kidnaped Feb. 7, 1985 as he left the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara.
Several weeks later his body and that of his pilot, Alfredo
Zavala-Avelar, who was kidnapped separately, were found on a remote
ranch 70 miles away. Camarena had been severely beaten.
   U.S. officials have said Camarena was kidnapped shortly after he
and other agents uncovered a drug trafficking operation run by
Rafael Caro-Quintero, who along with Fonseca-Carrillo was one of
Mexico's biggest drug kingpins.
   Camarena moans and complains of pains and injuries on the tapes.
Federal prosecutors say they believe the recorder was turned off
during beatings.
   The agent says at one point that he has ``sharp pains'' all over
his body and asks his captors: ``Couldn't I ask you to have my ribs
bandaged, please?''
   Affidavits about autopsy reports, which also were filed, state
that Camarena's jaw was broken in several places and his head was
shattered ``like an eggshell.''
   According to documents filed in court, federal prosecutors
believe that Sergio Espino-Verdin, a former Mexican police sergeant,
interrogated Camarena for two days at a large estate owned by
Fonseca-Carrillo outside Guadalajara.
   Prosecutors said the voices of Espino-Verdin and Caro-Quintero
have been identified on the tape.
   The transcript reveals that Camarena told his captors the DEA
knew the whereabouts of Fonseca-Carrillo and Caro-Quintero but that
U.S. agents in Guadalajara were not allowed to carry weapons and so
didn't conduct surveillance of the two men.
   ``To conduct surveillance over there at the house, I have never,
sir ... I am afraid,'' Camarena said.
   ``I did not want trouble. I just wanted to get out of here,'' he
said, referring to his transfer back to the United States that was
pending at the time.
   Camarena may have been attempting to mislead his abductors by
asserting that agents don't carry guns, said Ralph Lockridge, a DEA
spokesman in Los Angeles. Local commanders can authorize agents to
carry weapons, he said.
   ``He was just throwing out something that was wrong,'' Lockridge
said.
   Camarena mentions confidential information at times, indicating
that the tapes are authentic, according to affidavits of DEA agents
who worked with him. That information includes a reference to
complaints about the Guadalajara office from DEA headquarters.
   ``I'm telling you that we are being reprimanded from Washington
because, according to them, we are not working here,'' Camarena
says. ``As I say, well, who is going to do the work if they have one
unarmed?''
   Camarena gave only skimpy information about DEA informants,
causing the interrogator to snap: ``Who is it that put the finger on
Rafael? Don't tell me about your problems; speak of the information
you can give us, you can provide us to finish with this bunch of
jerks....''
   ``Yes, sir. What more can I tell you, sir?'' Camarena says in a
voice described in the transcript as ``very weak.''
   Defense motions have challenged the validity of the tapes, saying
they contain an unexplained burst of music and clicking sounds that
suggest tampering or fabrication.
   Raul Lopez-Alvarez, 28, Jesus Felix-Gutierrez, 38, and Rene
Martin Verdugo-Urquidez, 36, are scheduled to go on trial in
District Court here later this month. All have denied involvement in
the Camarena case.
   Caro-Quintero and Fonseca-Carrillo are in custody in Mexico City
and extradition proceedings are stalled. The other indicted men are
not in custody.

   The Dallas Times Herald, a daily in one of the
nation's most competitive newspaper cities, is being sold for the
second time in a year and a half.
   MediaNews Holdings Inc., controlled by Times Herald Chairman
William Dean Singleton, plans to sell the paper to DTH Media Inc., a
new corporation controlled by MediaNews stockholder John Buzzetta,
both parties said.
   Rumors had been circulating for weeks about the pending sale of
the Times Herald, which has had marginal profits in the face of a
weak state economy and tough competition from the larger newspaper,
The Dallas Morning News.
   Buzzetta, 38, has been associated with Singleton, 37, since 1977.
Buzzetta is president and majority stockholder in the Scrantonian
Tribune of Scranton, Pa.
   Singleton and a partner, Richard B. Scudder, acquired the Times
Herald, the second-largest paper in Dallas, in late 1986 for $110
million from Times Mirror Co. As part of the deal, they received $7
million that the newspaper had in the bank, as well as a $20 million
discount for paying early, to bring their total cost to $83 million.
   Singleton, who was in Denver Tuesday in meetings at The Denver
Post, which he also owns, said in a statement that proceeds from the
transaction will go toward retiring debt and for new acquisitions.
   The sale comes as the young entrepreneur has extended himself
financially to purchase The Houston Post; The Gloucester County
Times in Woodbury, N.J.; and Today's Sunbeam in Salem, N.J., which
he owns through MediaNews Holdings, a holding company under Media
News Group. Media News Group includes Garden State Newspapers, which
owns 16 medium-sized dailies.
   Specific terms of the Dallas deal were not disclosed, but
Buzzetta said, ``A substantial amount of cash and stock was involved
in the transaction.''
   Buzzetta said DTH Media Inc. will have a controlling interest
while MediaNews will retain a financial interest in the newspaper
and will remain a stockholder.
   ``The Dallas Times Herald is currently showing a healthy annual
operating profit,'' Buzzetta said in a statement.
   ``We're buying a winner and we intend to operate the Dallas Times
Herald in the proud tradition that has kept it successful for more
than 100 years,'' he said.
   Buzzetta said no layoffs are planned in the Times Herald newsroom.
   In his statement, Buzzetta said he would become publisher of the
newspaper and Art Wible, publisher since 1985, has agreed to leave.
   Three Times Herald executives, editor Dave Burgin, executive vice
president and general manager Robert Hollingsworth and senior vice
president and chief financial officer Richard L. Jacobs will join
MediaNews Group.
   Singleton said in his statement, ``The proposal was attractive
enough financially that it had to be considered seriously.''
   Earlier reports said Singleton was negotiating to sell the paper
for $140 million.
   Two weeks ago, the Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times
Herald agreed to drop lawsuits filed against each other concerning
paid circulation figures.
   Latest figures released through the Audit Bureau of Circulation
for the six months ended Sept. 30, 1986, showed the Times Herald's
daily circulation was 246,370 and The Morning News' was 390,987. On
Sunday, the Times Herald's reported paid circulation was 338,963,
and the Morning News reported 531,417.
   The next ABC report, for the period ending March 31, 1988, is
expected in late summer.
   Newspaper industry analysts said resolving the circulation
dispute was integral to a sale of the Times Herald.
   ``I don't think you'd buy a newspaper without having circulation
figures resolved,'' said John Reidy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
in New York. ``This way you don't have two guys suing each other and
confusing the advertisers.''

   Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg easily won
his party's backing Tuesday to run for re-election against
Republican Peter Dawkins, and Newark Democrats gave city councilman
Donald M. Payne a chance to become New Jersey's first black in
Congress.
   In the presidential primary, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
coasted to victory over Jesse Jackson for most of the 109 Democratic
delegates at stake. On the GOP side, Vice President George Bush was
unopposed for 64 delegates.
   Lautenberg, 64, overwhelmed primary opponents Elnardo Webster, a
state Corrections Department official who linked his campaign with
Jackson's presidential bid, and Harold Young, a theology student who
describes himself as a ``conservative radical Democrat.''
   ``I'm expecting a good vigorous race, and we are prepared to do
battle, although that may be the wrong terminology since I am going
against a general,'' Lautenberg said, referring to Dawkins' rank at
retirement from the U.S. Army.
   With 52 percent of the vote counted, or 3,028 of 5,825 precincts
reporting, Lautenberg had 161,441 votes, or 79.6 percent; Webster
had 24,494 votes, or 12.1 percent; and Young had 16,834 votes, or
8.3 percent.
   Democrats in the 10th Congressional District chose Payne over his
fellow Newark city councilman Ralph Grant to run against the GOP's
Michael Webb for the seat held by Rep. Peter Rodino, retiring after
40 years in the House.
   With 74 of 328 precincts, or 23 percent, reporting, Payne had
8,326 votes, or 76 percent, to 2,610 votes, or 24 percent, for Grant.

   The White House AIDS commission gave its
tentative endorsement Tuesday night to the bulk of the 579
recommendations the panel's chairman wants to put in a report to
President Reagan later this month.
   In releasing his recommendations last week, retired Navy Adm.
James D. Watkins portrayed most of them as reflecting what he read
as the consensus of the 13-member committee.
   That turned out to be true during an 11-hour meeting as the
commissioners worked through the report page-by-page, making only
minor changes in wording and organization.
   Watkins' had predicted correctly that his final chapter calling
for legislation to vest sweeping new powers in the surgeon general _
currently Dr. C. Everett Koop _ would prove controversial.
   Watkins said Reagan should immediately proclaim AIDS a national
emergency as soon as legislation is passed setting up a new
framework within the government health bureaucracy to put the
surgeon general in charge of dealing with it.
   Although the commission did not reject Watkins' suggestions
outright, there was a sharp exchange of differences between the
chairman and commissioner William B. Walsh and it was clear Watkins
does not have the broad backing of the panel on his proposed shift
of power to the surgeon general.
   The issue of what, if anything, to recommend in the way of
administrative changes to deal with AIDS as well as future epidemics
was left up in the air with the commissioners agreeing to submit
their thoughts in writing for the panel's staff to synthesize and
present for further consideration at the final working session next
Thursday and Friday.
   The final report is due June 24 at the White House and it became
clear after Tuesday's session that it will essentially track
Watkin's recommendations _ including his call for strong federal
legislation to protect people with the AIDS virus from
discrimination.
   Watkins told fellow commissioners he has received letters from
``both sides of the aisle'' that leads him to believe ``there is a
feeling of momentum in Congress'' for passage of such legislation
despite administration opposition.
   ``It is something that can be done in this session of Congress,''
he said. ``I don't know that it will be.''
   Walsh had expressed some concern about the anti-discrimination
recommendation in early discussions, saying it ``would not be
fruitful and would not be fair'' to make a specific recommendation
about AIDS discrimination.
   ``If we're going to make it, we should expand it to cover not
just AIDS, but all diseases,'' said Walsh, the director of Project
HOPE, a private international health delivery organization.
   However, other commissioners noted that the recommendation is for
a law that spells out that people with the AIDS virus are to be
treated just like people with any other handicapping disease _ no
worse, no better.
   Watkins said the anti-discrimination recommendation should be the
No. 1 priority in the final report's introductory chapter.
   Among the other Watkins recommendations the panel agreed to
emphasize at the forefront of the final report:
   _That all of those infected with the AIDS virus _ an estimated
1.5 million Americans compared with fewer than 70,000 actually
diagnosed with the full-blown illness _ should be considered part of
the epidemic.
   _That intravenous drug abuse is a national emergency that must be
successfully dealt with if the AIDS epidemic is to be curtailed.
   _That the fight against the disease will require resources of
private as well as government resources.
   _That compassion for those with AIDS should be empasized at all
levels.
   Tuesday's marathon session was designed to reach as much
consensus as possible. Any lingering differences over final wording
will be resolved by votes, if necessary, at next week's sessions.
   Watkins assured panel members there would be ample time for
debate, promising to run the planned Thursday-Friday session into
the weekend if necessary.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most
often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or
semen from infected persons. Its chief victims have been homosexual
men and intravenous drug users.
   As of June 6, AIDS had been diagnosed in 64,506 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 36,255 have died since June 1981, according
to the federal Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to have
recovered from AIDS.

<HEAD>Court Orders Philadelphia To Free Hundreds From Crowded Jails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court reversed itself Tuesday and
ordered Philadelphia to release hundreds of inmates from its
overcrowded prisons within 24 hours.
   The district attorney's office predicted dire consequences,
saying prosecution will slacken and criminals will grow bold knowing
they face little chance of going to jail.
   ``You are going to have whole classes of people who can't be put
in prison,'' said Sarah Vandenbraak, an attorney representing the
district attorney's office. ``Ninety-nine percent of the drug
dealers we prosecute won't get in prison _ not even the major drug
dealers.''
   The order from the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals forces the
city to free prisoners awaiting trial by paying bail of up to $250
to reach a ceiling of 3,750 imates. As of Saturday, 4,059 were
housed in the city's four jails.
   If a threat to exceed the cap exists, authorities also will be
unable to imprison any criminals but those charged with the most
serious crimes.
   Sarah Vandenbraak, an attorney representing the district
attorney's office, said the result will be the city footing the bill
to put dangerous criminals back on the street.
   ``Once people realize they can't be put in prison, they're not
going to put up the bail for themselves,'' Ms. Vandenbraak said.
``Do you think anybody in these categories is going to be putting up
bail?''
   The appeals court on Monday blocked U.S. District Judge Norma
Shapiro's order imposing the limit and the moratorium on prison
admissions beginning at midnight.
   The order was based on a consent decree the city signed in 1986
and had agreed to fulfill a year ago. The decree resulted from a
class-action lawsuit inmates filed in 1982 challenging prison
conditions.
   The original stay was requested by District Attorney Ronald
Castille, who said he needed time to prepare a formal appeal of
Shapiro's moratorium.
   After the three-member appeals court issued a one-sentence
reversal Tuesday, Ms. Shapiro modified her order, giving the city
until 5 p.m. Wednesday to meet the cap and to restrict admissions.
   Ms. Vandenbraak said the city will not take further legal action
until a hearing already scheduled on June 22.

   The Sandinista government and
U.S.-backed rebels held daylong talks Tuesday on a government
proposal for democratic reform in exchange for rebel disarmament.
   The fourth round of peace talks resumed Tuesday in a climate of
mutual distrust, but both sides said they might be nearing agreement
after more than six years of war.
   Information Minister Manuel Espinoza reported after the talks
adjourned at 7 p.m. (5 p.m. EDT) Tuesday until 9 a.m. Wednesday,
``We have made substantial advances.''
   A representative of the leftist government, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said earlier that the government proposal
bows to almost all the rebel demands for democratic reforms.
   The rebels, known as Contras, described the proposal as vague but
said it raised hopes for an agreement.
   Contra negotiator Alfredo Cesar said: ``The Nicaraguan Resistance
is here with a political decision to sign a definite agreement for
permanent and lasting peace in Nicaragua if the government shows its
political commitment to make the democratic reforms in this country
to achieve that lasting peace.''
   The Resistance is the Contras' umbrella organization.
   Bosco Mamatoros, spokesman for the rebels, told reporters after
the meeting ended ``there were advances in the discussion on themes
of a substantial character,'' but said political reform remained
``the biggest problem in the discussions.''
   He charged that the government was ``using the dialogue to gain
time. They have to demonstrate the opposite to us.''
   The talks are taking place amid a temporary truce enacted March
21. The rebels have extended the truce until Thursday, and the
government has declared a unilateral cease-fire until the end of
June. Each side accuses the other of violations.
   The government proposal promises press freedom, the right to
strike, electoral reforms, an end to Sandinista control of the army
and freedom for political prisoners.
   The proposal offers the Contras a role in talks begun late last
year with opposition political parties. The so-called national
dialogue has made little headway. On April 26, the opposition
parties suspended the talks pending settlement of a workers' strike.
   The scars and bitterness of the civil war were dramatized Tuesday
in dramatic full-page ads by the Mothers Committee of Heroes and
Martyrs in the two pro-government newspapers. The committee is
comprised of mothers whose children have died in the war.
   The ad in the Barricada newspaper showed pictures of wounded
children along with rebel commander Col. Enrique Bermudez. ``We
don't want amnesty for criminals,'' it said.
   The ad in El Nuevo Diario showed women carrying a coffin, a child
leaning on a cross and a bullet-riddled body. ``We won't forget,''
it said. ``Our pain calls for justice.''
   The Sandinistas have called for disarmament of the rebels to be
completed by September while the Contras have proposed January. The
Contras say they will not lay down arms until the nation of 3
million people is a democracy. The Sandinistas say it already is.
   Vice President Sergio Ramirez said Monday night the Contras
should accept the Sandinista proposals because ``at best, within a
month they will not have the capacity to negotiate more.''
   U.S. military aid to the rebels ended on Feb. 26. Three weeks
later, the rebels signed a temporary cease-fire and began talks on a
permanent peace with the Sandinistas. The Contras are also plagued
by deep divisions within their ranks.
   The Sandinistas, who get military and economic aid from the
Soviet bloc, also have compelling reasons for ending a war that has
claimed 26,000 lives.
   The Nicaraguan economy is a shambles and the government faces
widespread public dissatisfaction over chronic shortages and its
failure to deliver on promises made when it took power in July 1979.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
expressed hope that the talks would be productive and that the
Sandinistas would negotiate in good faith.
   ``The key issue is the Sandinistas' willingness to democratize,''
Ms. Oakley said. ``We're hopeful, but we note that in recent weeks
the Sandinistas have increased repression of the internal
opposition.''

   Despite missing several weeks of school
because of suspensions, three street preaching children were
promoted to the next grade, their father said Tuesday.
   The Strode children, Duffey, Matthew and Pepper, were suspended
numerous times because they refused to proceed into the Eastfield
Elementary School building when they arrived on school property each
morning. Instead, the three children began preaching. Marion, N.C.,
school officials have stressed that the suspensions resulted not
from the preaching, but from failure to adhere to school rules.
   Their father, David Strode, said in a telephone interview that
McDowell County school officials notified him Tuesday afternoon that
his children had passed. Matthew will be in the first grade, Pepper
moves to the second grade and Duffey will go to the sixth grade.
   The children took comprehensive tests to complete the school
year. School officials would not release the test results, nor would
they say whether the children were promoted to their respective next
grades.
   Strode, who is building a house in another school district, said
the preaching will stop if the local schools end their teaching of
the theory of evolution.
   ``We don't think people who think Jesus Christ was a liar should
be teaching our children in our schools, unless people have
liberties the other way,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, residents of Marion are circulating a petition asking
Strode to either keep his children from preaching in the schoolyard
or to leave the town.
   ``If you're going to be a preacher, public opinion can't bother
you,'' Strode said.

   A woman sentenced to jail for refusing to testify
about her daughter's claim that she was the victim of a racist
attack will seek sanctuary in a church and dare authorities to
arrest her there, her lawyers said Tuesday.
   ``The question would be whether this government can respect the
right of the black church, because if it cannot we are prepared
tomorrow and the day after that to put our lives on the line,'' said
attorney Alton Maddox Jr.
   ``Before you put a hand on Glenda Brawley, you will come through
me. Please have a bullet designated for me,'' he said.
   Mrs. Brawley's daughter Tawana, 16, has said she was abducted and
assaulted last November in Wappingers Falls, 95 miles north of New
York City, by six white men, including one who flashed a police-like
badge.
   But she and her family have refused to cooperate with
investigators, claiming local and state officials are engaged in a
racially motivated cover-up.
   Mrs. Brawley, 33, was sentenced to 30 days in jail Monday for
defying a grand jury subpoena to testify, but upon the urging of
state Attorney General Robert Abrams she was given one more chance _
an opportunity Wednesday to tell a judge why she had refused to
cooperate.
   But Maddox insisted at a news conference that Mrs. Brawley would
not appear Wednesday.
   ``Glenda Brawley will be seeking relief before a higher
authority, she will be putting her life in God's hands,'' he said.
   Neither Maddox nor others at the news conference would say what
church would offer Mrs. Brawley asylum. They insisted authorities
had no right to enter a church to arrest her.
   But Sgt. John Clifford, a spokesman for the New York Police
Department, said the decision to arrest people who request sanctuary
privileges is decided on a case-by-case basis. ``There's no hard and
fast rule,'' he said.
   Police are allowed to arrest suspects who run into a church, the
spokesman said. However, if the suspect requests refuge and is
granted sanctuary by the pastor, police have to obtain a search
warrant to make an arrest or negotiate with the parties involved,
Clifford said.
   Attorney C. Vernon Mason reiterated the theme of the Brawleys and
their advisers _ ``It is clear we cannot get justice for Tawana
Brawley.''
   He said authorities had ``done everything possible to blame the
victim even more. How ludicrous it is for the nation to see that the
only person arrested in this case is the mother of a black rape
victim. People should be outraged.''
   Miss Brawley was found Nov. 28, four days after she had
disappeared. She was lying dazed in a plastic bag in a road in
Wappingers Falls. Her hair had been shorn, animal excrement had been
smeared on her body and racial epithets had been scrawled on her
torso.
   Abrams said unless Miss Brawley's family cooperates soon, the
state's investigation into the incident will end without resolution.

   City authorities tried to head off a planned
pro-democracy march by university students on Wednesday by warning
that demonstrations without approval are illegal. They urged
students to ``keep a sober mind.''
   In front-page editorials, major official dailies accused some
student leaders of being agitators trying to negate China's reforms
and appealed to students to avoid the ``methods of anarchy.''
   The planned Wednesday afternoon march to Tiananmen Square, the
symbolic political center of China, would be the first major
political protest by students since the winter of 1986-1987.
Nationwide student unrest then led to a conservative backlash
against Western liberal ideas.
   Hu Yaobang was removed as Communist Party chief for failing to
stem the pro-democracy movement. The party purged several outspoken
political thinkers.
   More than 1,000 students rallied from Tuesday night into early
Wednesday at Beijing University, China's leading university, to
voice demands for greater democracy, more press freedom, better
living conditions for intellectuals and better campus security.
   The turmoil was prompted by the June 2 slaying of a university
student in an off-campus brawl. Six non-students were arrested in
the death.
   The killing brought to the surface student unhappiness over poor
living conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects after
graduation for the nation's low-paid intellectuals.
   Hundreds have gathered on the campus in the evenings for
impromptu debates on what broader lessons are to be learned from the
incident.
   Dozens of posters have gone up demanding democracy, a free press,
an end to government corruption and petty bureaucracy and greater
respect and higher salaries for intellectuals.
   In an announcement Wednesday, the Beijing municipal government
denounced a ``handful of people with ulterior motives who have taken
the opportunity of this criminal case (the murder) to concoct rumors
and slander the reform and open policy in violation of the law, and
sabotaging political stability and unity.''
   It reminded students that all demonstrations without previous
approval from police are illegal. That regulation was imposed after
the 1986-87 disturbances.

family gathered before the simple cross that marks his grave, Robert
F. Kennedy was remembered as a father who guided his children with
love and understanding and as a public figure who was ``always ready
to stop and reach out to others.''
   Tourists mingled with friends and aides of the New York senator
Monday evening at a Mass of remembrance for Kennedy, who was shot by
an assassin 20 years ago as he left a Los Angeles celebration of his
victory in the 1968 California presidential primary.
   ``I invite you to join us in renewing the commitment that was his
life, his spirit and his hope,'' said Matthew Kennedy, who was not
yet 3{ years old when his father died.

   Morton Thiokol, sole manufacturer of solid-fuel
space shuttle boosters blamed for the Challenger disaster, has
dropped out of the competition for a $1.2 billion contract to make
boosters for the 1990s.
   The Chicago-based company announced Monday that it wants to
concentrate on redesigning the booster used on Challenger, whose
fiery disintegration shortly after takeoff killed all seven
astronauts aboard.
   A presidential commission blamed the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion on
a plume of hot gas that leaked through a joint in a Thiokol-built
solid-fuel booster, igniting the main fuel tank.
   The motor redesign is almost complete, with a test firing set for
next month at Cape Canaveral, Fla., said Rocky Raab, a company
spokesman in Utah.
   Thiokol's Utah plant was the sole manufacturer of shuttle
boosters, and the National Aeronautics and Space Admininistration
must look elsewhere for producers of the next-generation version,
the advanced solid rocket motor.

   Two small savings and loans gambled on risky
investments in real estate and such things as windmill farms, but
collapsed from shaky lending that led to a record $1.35 billion
federal payout to depositors, officials say.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board on Monday closed American
Diversified Savings Bank and North America Savings and Loan
Association, both of Costa Mesa, without arranging for a takeover of
the thrifts by another institution.
   ``These two represented abuses,'' said bank board member Lawrence
White. ``The whole essence of being a depository institution with
government-provided insurance is that there is a strong ...
obligation to operate in a safe and sound manner. These two places
did not.''

   The nation's 17-year-old students are dismal at
math, with only half able to cope with problems usually taught in
junior high school, a testing agency reported today.
   The federally sponsored National Assessment of Educational
Progress also said that nearly 27 percent of 13-year-olds are
lacking in basic computational skills.
   More than a quarter of the 17-year-olds reported that they did
not usually understand what was talked about in mathematics class,
and only 6 percent could solve problems that took several steps or
involved algebra or geometry.
   The agency reported the results of tests it gave nearly 15,000
students ages 9, 13 and 17 in 1985-86, as well as comparative data
from math assessments in 1973, 1978 and 1982.
   The report, ``The Mathematics Report Card: Are We Measuring Up,''
said all three age groups improved recently, but mostly on low-level
skills, and the 17-year-olds still have not regained all the ground
they lost in the 1970s.

   As a 22-year-old Army nurse, Jacque Navarra Rhoads
tended the casualties of war amid the monsoons, mud and gunfire of
Vietnam, seeing both death and the enemy face-to-face.
   Though she defied the odds to save the wounded and held the hands
of the dying who clung to her, alone and frightened, no trumpets
sounded for her or the 10,000 other women who served in Vietnam,
eight of whom gave their lives.
   ``I just don't think people really understand what we did
there,'' said Mrs. Rhoads, 39.
   Of the dozens of Vietnam movies and television shows, none was
about women until this spring, when ABC launched ``China Beach,'' a
Vietnam War series centered on combat nurse Colleen McMurphy, played
by Dana Delany, and four other women with representative roles in
the war.
   The final episode of the season airs tonight. The show has been
renewed for the fall after a seven-week run that brought good
ratings and critical praise.
   Mrs. Rhoads, who co-edited the book, ``Nurses in Vietnam: The
Forgotten Veterans,'' believes the show is realistic.
   Scenes in which McMurphy's hootch is blown up and she has to care
for a Viet Cong woman who killed an American soldier with a grenade
bring back all too familiar memories.
   ``I feel what that nurse was doing was what I was doing. That was
me,'' she said.
   But some female veterans complain the show stereotypes women in
Vietnam as prostitutes, bimbos and manhunters, among other things.
At the same time, they do agree it has redeeming value in making
mass audiences aware that women served in Vietnam.
   Peggy Perri, 42, a Vietnam combat nurse who now works for the
William Joiner Center for the Study of War and Social Consequences
at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, finds the show demeaning.
   Ms. Perri was one of 75 women who signed a recent petition
protesting the way China Beach portrays women. The petition,
circulated at the second National Conference on Women and the
Military held at the Joiner Center, was sent to ABC.
   ``I feel insulted,'' Ms. Perri said, objecting in particular to a
scene in which McMurphy dons a sequined miniskirt and joins singer
Laurette Barber, played by Chloe Webb, onstage at a USO club.
Another sore spot for Ms. Perri and other veterans is the character
of K.C., a prostitute.
   Ms. Perri was unable to talk about her experiences in Vietnam
until three years ago, even though she had left 20 years ago.
   ``I was unable to deal with the stereotypes that people had about
women who were in Vietnam,'' she said. ``This show validates those
stereotypes. The thing that is unrealistic is all this emphasis,
these women characters as sexual beings.''
   Cherie Rankin, a 41-year-old Norwood, Mass., social worker who
was with the American Red Cross in Vietnam, says her counterpart in
``China Beach'' is so naive she never seems able to understand what
is going on.
   ``I remember,'' Ms. Rankin said, ``being overwhelmed by the
numbers of men and what was happening to them, the deaths and
injuries, the thousand-yard stares, the guys who after a short
period of time looked like there was nobody at home when you looked
into their eyes. They were very old men in young bodies.''
   Tired of having to smile and be friendly on the job, tired of
being gawked at, she isolated herself in her hootch in the few
off-duty hours she had.
   ``It's not a documentary, so we will from time to time bend
things to fit dramatic purpose,'' said William Broyles Jr.,
co-creator of the show and himself a Vietnam veteran. Broyles said
female vets serve as consultants on the show and the producers have
gone to great pains to make the characters, costumes and stories
realistic.
   But was the Vietnam War itself real, given the contradictions and
the contrasts? Where else could you have a front row seat to the
drama of war, sitting on rooftop terraces, sipping scotch and water,
watching flares light up the night skies and listening to the rumble
of bombs and the rat-a-tat of machine-gun fire?
   ``I never had a sexual relationship over there,'' Rhoads writes
in her book. ``Dating, well, you'd walk around bunkers and talk
about home. ... You'd bring a bottle of wine and he'd bring the
glasses. ... You'd sit and watch the B52s bomb across the DMZ. . ..
The sky would light up in different colors and you'd sit and watch
the fireworks. ... It sounds strange, watching somebody's village
get blown up. We didn't want to think about the lives being lost.''

   When Patricia Morison first met Cole Porter in
1947, she sang a Rodgers and Hammerstein song for him.
   ``I thought it was safer,'' she says with a laugh. Porter must
have liked what he heard from the young actress who at the time was
not known as a singer.
   ``He gave me the score for something called `Kiss Me, Kate' and
told me to learn it,'' Miss Morison recalls. ``He was having a
difficult time raising the money for the show. It took over a year.''
   The wait was worth it. ``Kiss Me, Kate'' turned out to be
Porter's biggest musical success and gave Miss Morison the
opportunity to play the temperamental Lili Vanessi and sing such
songs as ``Wunderbar'' and ``So in Love.''
   Forty years later, she will sing those songs again in New York at
``A Cabaret for Cole,'' one of the opening attractions of the First
New York International Festival of the Arts. The one-night concert
will be held Sunday at Town Hall.
   ``Broadway has always been my first love,'' says Miss Morison who
now lives in California. ``You never lose that once you've tasted
it.''
   One of the women who turned down a role in ``Kiss Me, Kate'' will
also be on hand for the Sunday songfest. Mary Martin will sing
another Porter song, ``My Heart Belongs to Daddy'' from ``Leave It
to Me,'' a number she first sang on Broadway 50 years ago. The show
was Miss Martin's Broadway debut and the song, a coy striptease
number, made her a star.
   These two legendary women are not the only attractions at ``A
Cabaret for Cole.'' The other singers doing the songs of Cole Porter
also have impeccable credentials. They include Karen Akers, Kaye
Ballard, Barbara Cook, Michael Feinstein, Hildegarde, Sylvia Syms,
Margaret Whiting and Julie Wilson.
   The concert is a benefit for the Mabel Mercer Foundation which
was founded after Miss Mercer's death in 1984 to widen the audience
for cabaret. The singer was generally considered to be the supreme
cabaret artist, known for her ability to interpret a song's
emotional sense.
   From the late 1930s until the late 1970s, she sang in several New
York nightclubs including Le Ruban Bleu and Tony's, as well as at
the St. Regis Hotel.
   Porter was a great friend of Miss Mercer. He thought her
rendition of ``Just One of Those Things'' was the best version ever
done.
   For Miss Morison, the chance to appear in ``Kiss Me, Kate'' 40
years ago was a dream come true. To do it, she needed to get out of
a commitment to appear in what was a new line of work for actors in
1947 _ a TV series.
   ``I think it was called `The Cases of Eddie Drake,''' Miss
Morison says. ``I played a lady psychiatrist to whom the detective
came and told his stories, lying on the couch.''
   Miss Morison did get to New York after the producer shot all her
13 segments on the television show in a quick two-week period and
she agreed to publicize the series.
   ``Cole was a wonderful friend,'' Miss Morison says. ``He had an
essential musicality. Plus there was the elegance of his lyrics.
   ``I just saw a concert version of `Jubilee' which is where `Begin
the Beguine' came from. That was done in 1935. Even with all the
topical and `in' jokes of the period about Dorothy Parker and Elsa
Maxwell and Noel Coward and others, the young audience watching it
got everything. Cole never seems to really date.''

<HEAD>Smelly Durian Fruit Barred from Singapore's New Subway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long banned from most hotels, hospitals and
commercial airliners in Southeast Asia, the redoubtable durian is
now barred from Singapore's new subway, the Mass Rapid Transport
system.
   The fabled, smelly fruit is back in season and signs at each
subway station warn: ``No durians are allowed on the MRT.''
   Eating and drinking on trains has been a no-no since the subway
opened in November, but shoppers were allowed to carry foodstuffs.
   So pungent is the durian, however, that extra precautions are
deemed necessary to keep it at bay. Violators face the equivalent of
a $250 fine.
   ``We all know that durians leave a lingering odor long after they
are taken away, especially in an air-conditioned place, and the
trains are air-conditioned,'' said an MRT spokesman.
   ``The smell is even offensive to those who love the fruit. They
might like eating the fruit, but I don't think they like the smell
too much.''
   Calling the spiky green fruit smelly does it an injustice.
   It stinks.
   Most descriptions of the durian's smell are unprintable, but one
that is printable describes the fruit this way: ``Rich brimstone
musk, whispering of depravity and month-old eggs. ... Durian is to
fruit what limburger is to cheese and pornography is to literature.''
   A British governor of Singapore in colonial days likened it to
``carrion in custard.''
   The fragrance allows no indifference: You love it or you leave
the room.
   The telltale stench permeates sections of Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines now that the main season for
the durian has started. Durians ripen twice a year, in December and
January and in June and July.
   The powerful aroma is the perfume of prosperity for growers and
others in the trade. Prices vary widely according to freshness,
weight, shape and where they are grown, a market that seems as
delicately balanced as Wall St.
   Three average durians sold for the equivalent of $5 as the season
opened. Individual prime quality fruits fetched more than five times
as much.
   Thailand is the biggest commercial grower and old Asia hands
usually rate Thai durians as tops in consistency and flavor. The
most malodorous seem to be grown in the Philippines.
   Malaysian devotees regard it as passion fruit capable of stirring
deep emotions, and there are tales of patient Indonesians waiting
days for durians to fall from trees, only to have to battle Sumatran
tigers for possession of the fruit.
   Folklore warns that durian is ``heady'' and should not be eaten
with alcohol. Those who do so are said to risk exploding.
   Related botanically to hibiscus, hollyhock, cotton and kapok, the
durian is native to Malaysia and has been cultivated for centuries.
Unlike the shorter Thai plantation version, trees in Malaysia and
elsewhere are too lofty to harvest and the fruit crashes to the
ground when it is ripe.
   Fermentation that starts the moment it drops can change the
flavor perceptibly within hours. The fruit spoils within a week and
few will eat durian more than three days after they fall.
   No junk food, the much-loved, much-hated durian is high in
protein, carbohydrates and vitamins B and C. Experts say it thrives
in soil with a high sulfur content, which doubtless contributes to
the pungent odor.
   Durians vary widely in size but usually are 8 inches long and 6{
inches wide and weigh about 6{ pounds. The outer rind bristles with
tough thorns or ``duri.''
   They are eaten raw after careful appraisal by purists who pride
themselves on picking out just the right one. A heavy knife is used
to split the fruit and expose the pulp, which ranges in color from
pale yellow to bright orange.
   For those without ready access to durians, the fruit can be
approximated by combining these ingredients: 3 bananas, 2 egg yolks,
1 pinch powdered sulfur, 3 tablespoons limburger cheese, 1 mashed
garlic clove, one-quarter pound cream cheese for body and 1 shoelace
for texture. Blend ingredients into a custard, mold around a horse
chestnut and serve with apprehension.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They came to college during the Great Depression.
They graduated, worked hard and shaped fulfilling lives. When the
University of North Carolina's class of '38 held its 50th reunion
recently, reporter Sid Moody _ who had chronicled their 25th in 1963
_ returned to round out their passage through five eventful decades.
Their story, as he presents it, is a memorable yearbook of half a
century of history as ordinary Americans lived it.

   This spring, in the autumn of their
time, they returned to where they once had been young.
   ``Red clay people from a red clay state,'' said one in the class
of 1938 at the University of North Carolina.
   Once, maybe. Not now.
   Thunderheads darkened the evening sky that June 7, 1938 when they
were given a diploma in one hand, a Bible in the other. Unforeseen
winds were to strew them across the globe in a half-century of
bearing witness.
   Depression. Three wars _ a victory, a standoff and a defeat _
burying their loss from each. The Bomb. Ike. JFK. Watergate. Heart
transplants. The Bomb. 747s. TV. The '60s. The Bomb. LSD. PCs. PCBs.
The Bomb.
   Once poor, they raised families in a flood tide of prosperity.
And the Japanese cars some drove back to their 50th reunion gave a
hint, perhaps, of its ebb. What their nation has seen and become,
they have seen and become.
   They are a yearbook of their times.

   _ From ``Dr. Frank,'' by Joe Patterson.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Frank Porter Graham: President University of North Carolina
1931-49. Died 1971.
   Dr. Frank is remembered by his former students of '38 as the best
of men in the worst of times. He was a focus of rectitude and
example when a quarter of the U.S. work force was unemployed; when
`Hoover carts,' wagons with rubber tires, replaced too-expensive tin
lizzies; when cotton was 7.9 cents a pound and the new minimum wage
a quarter; when a third of his 3,207 students worked their way
through raking leaves, stoking furnaces to meet an average of
$406.50 in annual fees. Hang on, he would urge his students at his
Sunday open house, I'll go to Washington to get the money.
   The UNC of the '30s strikes a bittersweet, simpler nostalgia
today. In 1938 there was a waiting line for the 100 copies of ``Gone
With the Wind'' on loan at the library. For a dime you could see
Clark Gable, Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy at the movies in ``Test
Pilot.'' ``Our Town,'' Thornton Wilder's small-town epic, won the
Pulitzer for drama.
   Harsh reality was buried under corsages, crepe ribbons and ball
gowns as the class of '38 danced in the transformed field house, The
Tin Can, to Kay Kayser or the Dorsey brothers. Seventy-nine of 89
coeds said they'd go no farther than a goodnight kiss.
   But there were harbingers, unsuspected, among the dogwood. In
Great Britain TV signals had been beamed 220 miles. In Germany, Otto
Hahn and Fritz Strassman were about to split an atom. Scientists at
Oxford were about to investigate why a mold called penicillium
seemed to kill bacteria.
   War? Twenty-two at that commencement would die in World War II.
But in 1938 a majority of the students approved Neville
Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler. In a poll, 599 of 974 said they
would fight only if the United States were invaded. The Army Air
Corps had only 13 of the B-17s that Red Benton, awaiting his diploma
alphabetically down front, would one day fly over a beach in
Normandy named Omaha. Behind him tennis star Ramsay Potts, who had
been repulsed by Hitler's ``Mein Kampf,'' would one day interrogate
the author's deputy, Hermann Goering, who ``cowered like an animal.''
   America had not then learned war, not even Dr. Frank. When Nick
Read planned a peace strike, the president, a pacifist, said he'd
ring the bell emptying the classrooms. ``Then it wouldn't be a
strike,'' Read protested. ``It'd be a better strike,'' said Dr.
Frank and rang the bell.
   But Dr. Frank knew other things. When a faculty member dined with
a black radical in Raleigh, some on the all-white campus called for
his dismissal.
   ``If a professor has to go on a charge of eating with another
human being, then I will go first,'' said Frank Porter Graham,
doctor of philosophy.

<HEAD>Dollar Slips Against Yen, Tokyo Stocks Inch Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished lower against the yen in
trading in Tokyo today, while stocks fell back modestly from their
record-high close the previous day.
   The dollar closed at 125.77 yen, down 0.30 yen from Monday's
finish. It opened the day at 125.75 yen and moved in narrow range
between 125.60 and 125.85 yen.
   ``The trading was relatively quiet without incentives to direct
the market, and the dollar remained stable throughout the day,''
said a foreign exchange dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues closed at 27,967.32, down 28.92 points, or 0.1 percent.
   On Monday, the stock market's key indicator rose 89.76 points and
closed at an all-time high of 27,996.24 points.
   ``The Nikkei index is down a little, but issues such as large
capitals, including shipbuilding and steel, continued to attract
buying interest, raising the trading volume,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama
of Nikko Securities.
   The market remained strong without any fear among investors that
prices were rising too high, he said.
   Some other traders, however, attributed the drop in the Nikkei
index to a sense among some participants that the market was
overheating, leading them to stay on the sidelines.
   The Nikkei index closed the morning session at 28,034.61 points,
making today the second consecutive day it went above 28,000 at the
end of the morning session, only to fall back in afternoon trading.
   Declining issues included automobiles and machineries. Advancers
included steels, cements and high-tech issues.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at a heavy 2.2 billion
shares, up from 1.6 billion shares Monday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices on the London stock exchange moved lower
Tuesday as the market pulled back from Monday's 13.5-point advance.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 selected stocks
was off 8.7 points, or 0.5 percent at 1,824.0 at midday. Trading
volume was a modest 305.8 million shares, compared with 192.5
million shares the same time Monday.
   ``There isn't enough in this market to shove London prices
further forward at this stage,'' said Jeffrey Thompson, chief equity
strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   Market players were still dubious that last week's 114.86-point
surge on Wall Street could be sustained. That was the biggest point
gain on record for a calendar week.
   Monday's 3.91-point rise in the Dow Jones industrial average to
2,075.21 didn't convince many skeptics.
   ``There are a lot of people who feel that Wall Street's rise last
week was fairly frothy and premature,'' another equity analyst said,
adding that most European equity markets have adopted a wait-and-see
attitude in order to get a better handle on the outlook for
inflation and interest rate movements.
   Thompson said the London exchange remains highly vulnerable to
Wall Street's movements.
   ``Sentiment is such that if Wall Street gets knocked on the head
at any stage, so could we get bumped at any time,'' he said.

<HEAD>Federal Insurors Allocate $1.35 Billion For Depositors Of Failed

<TEXT>
   Two small savings and loans gambled on risky
investments in real estate and such things as windmill farms, but
collapsed from shaky lending that led to a record $1.35 billion
federal payout to depositors, officials say.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board on Monday closed American
Diversified Savings Bank and North America Savings and Loan
Association, both of Costa Mesa, without arranging for a takeover of
the thrifts by another institution.
   ``These two represented abuses,'' said bank board member Lawrence
White. ``The whole essence of being a depository institution with
government-provided insurance is that there is a strong ...
obligation to operate in a safe and sound manner. These two places
did not.''
   Both institutions have been insolvent for some time. Regulators
took over management of American Diversified in 1986 and of North
America in 1987.
   The bank board is paying $1.14 billion from the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. to American Diversified depositors in the
largest cash payout the agency has made, agency Chairman M. Danny
Wall said. It is covering $209 million in deposits at North America.
   Wall said on NBC's ``Today'' program, both state and federal
regulators are looking more closely today at troubled institutions
than they were several years ago.
   A total of about $500,000 in both institutions exceeded the
FSLIC's $100,000 liability limit. Those depositors will share in
liquidation proceeds. The bank board expects to recover about $400
million from the sale of the thrifts' assets.
   Nationally, only 10 of 235 failed savings and loans since 1981
have been resolved with a straight payout to depositors. Usually,
the bank board pays a bonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick S&L
because it is cheaper. At the very least, the board arranges to
transfer deposits to another institution.
   But the unique characteristics of the two California thrifts made
that impractical, Wall said.
   The thrifts had few retail deposits, lacked branch offices, and
relied on high-cost, short-term deposits arranged through brokers.
The brokers in turn lent out the deposits for speculative real
estate ventures and other risky investments, Wall said.
   Closing the two thrifts will help all S&Ls by reducing pressure
to pay high interest rates, he said. Failing thrifts pay high rates
to get the cash needed to meet expenses and some healthy thrifts
have had to raise their rates to compete.
   North America was paying 8.53 percent interest on deposits, 1.45
percentage points above the average for all thrift institutions.
American Diversified was paying 8.64 percent.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
said the two thrifts were prime examples of ``several score''
high-flying institutions that in the early and mid-1980s used
federally guaranteed deposits to fuel rapid growth of shaky lending.
Regulators were unprepared for the boom and failed to check it, he
said.
   ``It was a systemic breakdown,'' Ely said. ``What we are seeing
are two of the more extreme examples of it. But they're not the only
ones out there. There are others.''
   Fred Wolf, director of accounting and general management for the
General Accounting Office, said today on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' 500 savings and loan institutions are insolvent and 200
of them ``are what we would classify as hopelessly insolvent.''
   Duayne Christensen, an Orange County dentist, formed North
America in 1983. Taking advantage of the deregulated interest rates
and liberalized lending and investment rules, it solicited deposits
at high interest rates and invested the funds primarily in high-risk
real estate deals that later failed.
   Christensen was killed in an automobile accident last year the
day before regulators seized North America. In a lawsuit filed
against his estate and a former associate, the FSLIC accused
Christensen of fraud, negligence and breach of fiduciary
responsibility, and sought at least $40 million in damages.
   Ranhir Sahni, a former airline pilot, acquired American
Diversified in 1983. He also pursued an aggressive growth strategy,
increasing the thrift's asset size to almost $800 million, from $11
million, in less than two years.
   Sahni invested in ``wind farms'' designed to produce electricity,
and in other non-traditional areas including two ethanol plants.
   Federal regulators have filed suit, accusing Sahni and other
officers and directors of fraud and racketeering and are seeking at
least $60 million in damages.
   American Diversifed and North America were two of six Orange
County savings and loans operating under the FSLIC's ``management
consignment'' program as of October.
   Since 1984, 31 California thrifts have come under receivership or
conservatorship by state or federal regulators, according to the
California Department of Savings and Loan.
   ``The laws are still there to make it legal to get in trouble,''
said state Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford. ``I
don't know how you insure against it.''
   Prior to American Diversified, the largest cash payout was $300
million in 1984 to close the Empire Savings and Loan of Mesquite,
Texas.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exports of Japanese cars and trucks to the United
States fell a steep 20.3 percent in April, the Japan Automotive
Manufacturers Association said.
   The association attributed the decline to a drop in sales of
Japanese models and an increase in U.S. production by Japanese
automakers.
   JAMA said Japanese automakers sent 274,162 cars and trucks to the
United States in April, the latest month for which statistics are
available. That was down from 344,068 in the same month last year.
   For the first four months of 1988, combined car and truck exports
are down 14.5 percent from the comparable period in 1987.
   While Japanese exports have fallen, the Big Three domestic
automakers increased their market share. General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have picked up a combined 3.2 points of
market share in the car and truck market so far this year.
   The decline in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese
yen has forced Japanese automakers to raise prices to the point
where many Japanese vehicles are more expensive than comparable
American-made vehicles.
   Japanese automakers began May with a 66-day supply of cars and
trucks in the United States, up from a 58-day supply at the same
time last year, according to the industry statistical journal Ward's
Automotive Reports.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the latest auction to the lowest level in two
weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 6.44 percent, down from 6.53

   The rates were the lowest since May 23 when three-month bills
sold for 6.34 percent and six-month bills averaged 6.71 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors

$9,837.20 and 7.05 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,660.30.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 7.59 percent last week
from 7.58 percent the previous week.

   The government will continue to stand behind
the nation's troubled savings and loan institutions, but that could
mean eventually having to turn to the taxpayers for more money, a
General Accounting Office official said today.
   ``I don't know of any other source you could tap,'' Fred Wolf,
director of accounting and general management for the GAO, the
investigating arm of Congress, said on ABC's ``Good Morning
America.''
   ``The federal government has clearly said that regardless of the
problems ... we stand behind the insurance,'' Wolf said.
   But, considering the state of the industry, if savings
institutions are not able to supply the money needed by the
insurance fund, ``there's only one other source, and that's
ultimately the taxpayer,'' he said.
   Wolf said some 500 savings and loans across the country are
insolvent, and 20 of them are ``what we would classify as hopelessly
insolvent.''
   Two institutions closed Monday are neither the best nor the worst
in the country, and there are a number of other large ones that will
wind up costing about the same when they fail, he said.
   The record $1.35 billion payment to depositors in two failed
California savings institutions is likely to renew debate over how
long the fund that insures thrifts can last without congressional
action.
   So far, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has gotten
by without taxpayer money. Congress last August provided for an
infusion of $10.8 billion over three years, to be raised by sale of
bonds paid off by the industry. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
the agency in charge of thrift institutions, has used $2.9 billion
of that borrowing authority.
   The FSLIC, which guarantees deposits up to $100,000, is paying
$1.14 billion to American Diversified Savings Bank and $209 million
to North America Savings and Loan Association. Both are located in
Costa Mesa, Calif.
   The American Diversified transaction is FSLIC's largest cash
payout in the agency's 54-year history, according to the top federal
S&L regulator, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board.
   The agency has spent more on assistance transactions, including
$2 billion a month ago to help Southwest Savings Association in
Dallas acquire four insolvent S&Ls, and $1.3 billion in November to
bail out Vernon Savings and Loan Association, also of Dallas.
   But in those cases most of the help came in the form of notes,
promising payment if needed, and guarantees against certain future
losses.
   The two California transactions drop the insurance fund cash
balance from $3.2 billion to $1.9 billion. However, another $465
million in revenue is due this month from insurance premiums paid by
healthy S&Ls.
   All told, including insurance premium payments by S&Ls, the fund
should have about $20 billion to work with over three years and
about $30 billion over 10 years.
   However, the GAO says that may not be enough. About 500 of the
nation's 3,120 federally insured S&Ls are considered insolvent and
the GAO says it will cost $26 billion to $36 billion to clean up the
mess.
   Private analysts put the price tag even higher _ at about $50
billion.
   Problems ahead for the thrift industry include Texas, where 143
of 281 thrifts are ailing. Sunbelt Savings Association in Dallas
alone recorded a $1.2 billion loss in the first quarter of this year.
   In California, the rescue of the second largest S&L holding
company in the nation, Financial Corp. of America in Irvine, is
still pending. The Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas, is
negotiating with the bank board over a takeover. Estimates of the
cost of that bail out run into the billions.
   Wall says the bank board has all it can responsibly spend through
1990. But should more money be required, there are basically three
sources where Congress will look.
   The first is the industry. George Gould, undersecretary of the
Treasury, estimates the industry could finance something less than
$15 billion. That's vigorously opposed by S&L lobby groups.
   The second is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which has $18
billion to insure deposits in 13,650 commercial banks. Commercial
banks and their regulators are already moving to try to head that
off.
   The third source would be tax funds, not an easy proposition to
get by Congress in an age of budget limits.

   Foley's Department Stores is laying off 5 percent
of its system-wide work force, some 800 employees, in an effort to
pare costs, company officials said.
   Foley's, taken over last month by May Department Stores Co., said
Monday the layoffs will affect executives as well as hourly workers.
   ``It's an attempt to get our operating costs down,'' said Dan
Hagan, Foley's vice president of public affairs.
   Foley's, which has 39 stores in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and
Oklahoma, employs about 16,000 workers.
   May, the nation's seventh-largest retailer, bought Foley's and 18
Filene's stores from Federated Department Stores Inc. last month
after Campeau Corp. took control of Federated.
   Linda Kristiansen, a retailing analyst with the investment firm
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said May is known for tough expense
controls.
   ``Senior management is closely involved with the divisions,'' she
said.
   May spokesman Jim Abrams has said May does not plan to close any
Foley's stores.
   Last year, Foley's merged with another Federated store,
Sanger-Harris of Dallas, resulting in the loss of 200 workers in
Houston and Dallas.

   Merv Griffin began a tender offer Tuesday for
Class A shares of Resorts International Inc., the casino company he
is splitting up with developer Donald Trump.
   The offer, being made by Griffco Acquisition Corp., will pay
shareholders $36 a share and expires at midnight EDT July 5.
   Griffin, the TV talk-show host turned investor, will pay
approximately $300 million for the Atlantic City, N.J., company,
which is controlled by Trump.
   Using his profits from the deal and other funds, Trump will buy
back the company's unfinished crown jewel, the vast Taj Mahal casino
in Atlantic City, for $230 million.
   The agreement calls for Trump, Resorts' chairman, to get a total
of $160 million _ $135 a share, or about $100 million _ for his
Class B shares, and $60 million to terminate his management
contract. The Class B shares, which carry special voting rights,
give him 88 percent control of the company.
   Griffin first offered to buy Resorts on March 17 for $35 a share.
The tender offer culminates a long series of on-again, off-again
negotiations.

   Gallo, 47, vice president of Modesto's E. & J. Gallo Winery, was
elected at the institute's annual meeting on Monday.

His cousin, Robert, was chairman in 1977-1978.
   John De Luca continues as Wine Institute president.
   Gallo predicted a 50 percent increase in wine exports for the

first-quarter exports of California wine reached 3.8 million
gallons, up 94 percent from a year ago. Canada led first quarter
export with shipments of more than a million gallons, more than
double last year's level.

   The stock market headed lower today, running into
resistance from sellers after its sharp rally over the past week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 118 points
over the past five sessions, dropped 11.02 to 2,064.19 in the first
half hour of trading today.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 336 up, 656 down and
467 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.08 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates rose in the bond market this morning. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, fell about $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Analysts said the pressure on bonds stemmed largely from
inflation worries that have increased with rising commodity prices
of late.
   Brokers said uncertainties over inflation and interest-rate
prospects helped to discourage traders from chasing after stocks
with the popular averages near the high end of the trading range in
which they have fluctuated for the past several months.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down { at 113~; General Electric, down ] at 42;
McDonald's, down ] at 45, and General Motors, down \ at 76}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.60 to 149.95. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .34 at 301.60.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 3.91 points

   Struggling Coleco Industries Inc. will
sell its plastic outdoor toys line and a plant where they are
produced to Hasbro Inc. and an unidentified Canadian company, a
published report said today.
   Hasbro and its partner will acquire the lines and the New York
state factory for $30 million, the Hartford Courant said, quoting
industry analysts and Coleco sources.
   Barbara Wruck, a Coleco spokeswoman, said today the company had
no comment on the report. A Hasbro spokesman was said to be in a
meeting and unable to comment.
   Coleco executives told workers of the agreement during a meeting
Monday morning at the company's West Hartford headquarters, the
Courant said.
   Coleco, which lost $47.4 million in the first quarter of this
year, has been in default on the interest payments on $335 million
of its debt securities. Investors who own $184 million of those
bonds have demanded immediate payment.
   The toymaker has offered to exchange the $335 million in bonds
for a combination of new bonds and common stock, but the orginal
terms of that offer were rejected by investors. The company has
extended the offer to June 30.
   The product lines to be sold include plastic wading and splashing
pools, pool filers, children's outdoor furniture and clubhouses, and
pedal-powered and battery-operated cycles.
   Those lines, which helped launched Coleco in the toy business in
1956, had sales last year of $77 million.

   Attorneys for the former president of Beech-Nut
Nutrition Corp., who was convicted of distributing phony apple
juice, have asked that their client be ordered to speak to business
students about his mistakes as an alternative to a prison term.
   Niels Hoyvald was found guilty Feb. 17 of 351 counts of violating
the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Each count carries a
possible three-year prison term and a $10,000 fine.
   Hoyvald and a co-defendant, former Beech-Nut Vice President John
Lavery, are scheduled to be sentenced Friday in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn. Lavery was found guilty of 429 counts of violating the
same act, along with 18 counts of mail fraud and one count of
conspiracy.
   Hoyvald's attorneys said in a presentencing memorandum,
``Business students undoubtedly hear this principle regularly in
their ethics classes. But the impact of the message would be far
clearer coming from Niels Hoyvald, whose career has been shattered
because he did not heed it, than it could ever be coming from a
textbook or a professor.''
   Thomas Roche, the lead prosecutor in the case, said the
government's sentencing recommendations would be made public at the
sentencing hearing. He declined comment on the memorandum.
   Hoyvald, president and chief executive officer of Beech-Nut from
April 1981 until shortly before his indictment in November 1986,
said in his defense during the trial he did not know about the
distribution of flavored sugar water as juice until June 25, 1982.
   After that date, Hoyvald said, he relied on the advice of four
attorneys in allowing continued distribution of the phony juice.
According to the government, the product contained little or no
apple juice.
   Beech-Nut, based in Fort Washington, Pa., is a subsidiary of
Nestle SA of Switzerland.

<TEXT>
   Gulf Financial Resources Inc. has offered to buy
Tenneco Inc.'s oil and gas business for an undisclosed amount of
cash.
   Gulf Financial, a private Houston-based investment and financial
advisory firm, has requested a meeting with Tenneco Chairman James
L. Ketelsen.
   The offer is believed to be the first for the operations since
Tenneco put them up for sale on May 25. Analysts have estimated that
the units could fetch between $5 billion to $7 billion.
   In a letter to Ketelsen, Gulf Financial set a Friday deadline for
a meeting on the proposal, said Henri A. Soussan, a principal in
Gulf Financial.
   ``We're making a friendly and attractive offer,'' Soussan said
Monday. ``We're waiting to hear from Mr. Ketelsen.''
   Soussan would not reveal how much Gulf Financial is offering or
other details of the proposal, which was outlined to Tenneco in a
letter last Wednesday.
   He said the offer is for both the exploration and production and
the refining and marketing operations of Tenneco Oil.
   ``We plan to keep them as one entity in an ongoing company,''
Soussan said. ``We intend to retain the senior management and all
employees. We would form a new company, Gulf America Resources Ltd.,
to continue the business.''
   Soussan said the bid is the first by Gulf Financial in the energy
field.
   Gulf Financial was formed two years ago to make real estate
acquisitions but has yet to make a purchase, Soussan said. The
company has bid for a number of large organizations _ real estate
giant Cadillac Fairview Corp., department store owner Joske's and
most recently, Westin Hotels & Resorts _ but has come up empty each
time.
   Soussan said that Gulf Financial has no staff. He said European
interests back the company, but he would not disclose names.
   ``They are certainly one of those whose interest will be
considered,'' Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said. ``If they are
deemed as being a qualified buyer, they will be invited'' to make a
bid.
   Macrum said he could not say if Ketelsen would be meeting Gulf
Financial representatives.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened sharply
higher again this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, but many
contracts quickly began to fade in early dealings.
   Wheat fell into the minus column shortly after the opening.
   All the major agricultural futures advanced the permissible
limits Monday, and the exchange expanded both the trading limits and
margin requirements for today.
   The exchange's action puts traders in greater jeopardy and
dampens the upward price movement, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with
G.H. Miller & Co.
   In addition, weekly crop reports released after the close of
trading Monday showed some deterioration of the wheat crop, but it
less than had been expected, said Gidel.
   Weather conditions remain severely dry and warm in the Midwest,
although there was some promise of showers in parts of Indiana and
Ohio.
   In early trading, wheat was 6} cents lower to 2 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.76 a bushel; corn was 5}
cents to 10 cents higher with July at $2.52 a bushel; oats were 10{
cents to 12{ cents higher with July at $2.19 a bushel; and soybeans
were 14 cents to 25{ cents higher with July at $9.04 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .80 cent higher with the June
contract at 73.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .55
cent higher with August at 75.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .30
cent lower to 1.05 cents higher with June at 52.65 cents a pound;
and frozen pork bellies were .35 cent lower to 1.13 cents higher

<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is planning to
ban four color additives used in cosmetics and drugs because they
may cause cancer.
   Officials announced Monday that the additives _ red dyes Nos. 8,
9 and 19, and orange dye No. 17 _ will be banned beginning July 15.
   The announcement followed an April 18 Supreme Court decision in
which the high court refused to let the government approve the use
of color additives that pose a minimal risk of causing cancer.
   The court rejected arguments by the cosmetics industry that safe
substances are being forced off the market.
   The Supreme Court let stand a ruling last October by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here that federal law prohibits the FDA
from approving use of red dye No. 19 and orange dye No. 17 even
though the cancer risks are ``trivial.''
   Government researchers, citing tests with laboratory animals,
said the lifetime use of a product with orange dye No. 17 poses a
cancer risk of one in 19 billion, and for red dye No. 19 one in nine
million.
   The FDA said the threat from each use was ``so trivial as to be
effectively no risk.''
   The appeals court gave a strict interpretation to a 1960 federal
law that prohibits FDA approval for any color additive ``found ...
to induce cancer in man or animal.''
   William B. Schultz, a lawyer for the activist consumer group
Public Citizen, said the decision was important because the dyes
offer no health benefit and some cancers will be prevented.
   ``For cosmetics, it may mean there a few shades of lipstick that
will be lost. I think that will make no difference to people,'' he
said.
   Peter Barton Hutt, a lawyer representing the Cosmetics,
Toiletries and Fragrances Association, said the decision was a
disappointment but that it was ``more important as a symbol than in
terms of its specific impact.''

   Harry and Leona Helmsley, wealthy real estate
operators who are already facing twin tax fraud indictments, could
receive more bad news: additional charges for allegedly using a
corporate aircraft for private use, a federal prosecutor has
revealed.
   ``There's a lot of money involved _ several hundred thousand
dollars,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita told U.S. District
Judge John Walker Jr. on Monday in discussing the chance of a
superseding indictment against the Helmsleys.
   DeVita, at a pre-trial hearing in Manhattan, said the extra
charges against the Helmsleys _ one of the world's wealthiest
couples _ will be filed by July 31 or not at all.
   DeVita told Walker he would be issuing grand jury subpoenas
regarding the plane use. Defense lawyers indicated they would try to
quash the subpoenas and block the indictment. DeVita refused to
discuss the grand jury probe outside the courtroom.
   Helmsley, 79, and his 67-year-old wife were indicted April 15 on
federal and state charges that they hid about $4 million in
renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion as business
deductions.
   The couple has pleaded innocent to both the 47-count federal
indictment and the 188-count state indictment. Their federal trial
is set to begin Sept. 14, with the state trial to follow.
   Much of the Monday session was spent with attorneys haggling over
the more than 500,000 documents subpoenaed by the government in the
case. DeVita agreed to meet with defense lawyers in an effort to
indicate which of the tons of documents are relevant to the case.

   Indian stock brokers on Tuesday boycotted
trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange to protest violence on the
trading floor a day earlier.
   The exchange, India's largest, was officially open, but no
transactions were reported.
   The exchange was shut down Monday afternoon after disgruntled
exchange workers agitating for higher pay attacked brokers on the
trading floor. The United News of India said that 12 brokers were
injured in the melee.
   The workers had staged a one-day strike May 9 to underscore their
demand for pay increases.
   The market, in the doldrums for months, has been recovering in
recent weeks following widespread approval of the Indian
government's 1988-89 budget and its new import-export policy, which
liberalizes trade regulations for many industries.

   A rural North Dakota factory is making it
easier to locate baggage at busy airports, place bets at Las Vegas
casinos and even find love in a bustling East Coast singles bar.
   Northstar Enterprises Inc. makes computerized indoor message
boards and signs and is winning acceptance as one of the leaders in
the industry.
   ``We really feel we're the Cadillac of the business,'' said
Northstar President Allan Larson. ``That's what we're shooting for.''
   Larson declines to disclose the 9-year-old company's sales
figures but said they have grown by 20 percent to 30 percent a year
since it was founded.
   He predicts that the light-emitting diode industry in five years
should reach $200 million in sales, and he believes Northstar will
capture up to 20 percent of the market.
   ``The opportunities are just unlimited,'' said Larson.
   The industry is relatively new. About six U.S. companies are
manufacturing electronic message systems, and most are less than a
decade old.
   Northstar started in 1979 with five products. It now offers more
than 30, and is doing more custom design work, said Larson, who
joined the company in 1980 and became president in 1982.
   Northstar's message boards can be programmed for hundreds of
different messages from a computer keyboard. The messages can be
programmed to run laterally or up and down and can be accompanied by
graphics or animation.
   The message boards can be custom-built to any specifications, but
many of the signs come with letters about 7 inches to 8 inches high,
Larson said. The boards are generally long but only about as deep as
the letters.
   The signs are made up of hundreds of bulbs (most come with red
bulbs) which light up according to a computer command to form
messages.
   ``Specialized software is where the future lies,'' said Dewey
Olson, vice president and national sales manager and the last of
Northstar's three founders still with the company.
   Northstar was founded by two Mayville men, Olson and Dale Beck,
and a Chicago-based computer consultant, Steve Hogan, who saw an
untapped market for electronic message systems.
   The company operates out of a 5,000-square-foot plant located
between Mayville, population 2,255, and Portland, population 627,
about 55 miles north of Fargo, N.D. The plant employs 22 people
full-time, and another dozen part-timers are on the payroll.
   In 1986, Northstar merged with Lexicon Inc., a Salt Lake
City-based company that made computer software.
   The company has placed boards in airports, casinos, hospitals,
restaurants, bars, bowling alleys, financial institutions and
schools nationwide.
   Northstar boards flash instant odds on sporting events at
Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, and Harrah's in Atlantic City, N.J.
Several mid-size airports use the boards to help travelers locate
baggage and boarding areas. The company also has completed a deal
with the Baltimore Mass Transit System, Olson said.
   In addition, Northstar has developed what it believes to be the
first electronic display cardiac alert system in the nation, Larson
said. The system, which has been in use at the Bethesda Naval
Hospital for four years, allows medical personnel to alert 27
critical areas of the hospital simultaneously during an emergency
involving a heart patient, he says.
   Looking to the future, company officials see its message boards
used as promotional devices on city buses, subway cars and
pay-telephones. Company officials believe the airport industry
provides the greatest potential, and Olson said he is already
working on more projects with major airports around the country.
   One of the most unusual uses of the company's message boards has
been in a game called Selectrocution played in East Coast singles
bars. In the game, bar patrons use a message board to make
acquaintances. The game ends with the patrons being ranked for
desirability by others in the bar and matched by computer at
evening's end with anyone expressing mutual interest.
   With bids out on more than $16 million worth of projects and
several others already in the works, Larson feels the future holds
promise for his company.
   ``Our products are applicable in so many areas it's hard to
narrow the scope to areas that will have the greatest impact,''
Larson said. ``We're trying to look at key ... markets where we can
concentrate and do a good job.''

<HEAD>Cooler Makers Offer New Ad Approaches, Flavors</HEAD>

   Cooler makers are putting on a new face this
summer as they try to inspire fresh interest in a beverage category
whose torrid growth pace slowed markedly last year.
   The California Cooler beach party is history. So is the Sun
Country cooler spokesbear. And actor Bruce Willis is missing from
the action in new ads for Seagram's Wine Coolers.
   Frank and Ed are still pitching Bartles & Jaymes coolers, but it
is uncertain who is going to be dreaming up new commercials for the
folksy pair since the ad agency that created the brand's fictional
founding fathers quit.
   Something else is missing _ the fruit pulp that category pioneer
California Cooler had once brandished as evidence that it was ``the
real stuff.''
   But the cooler makers are trying to liven things up with new
flavors that they hope will get people to try their first cooler or
give them another try.
   Seagram's, the category leader, plans eight flavors this year, up
from six last year. Bartles & Jaymes has doubled its list to four.
California Cooler has five flavors, up from four a year ago.
   The big question facing the industry is whether coolers are a
sustainable segment of the alcoholic beverage market or just a fad.
Cooler sales tailed off in the second half of last summer, prompting
some analysts to speculate that consumers had tired of the
sweet-tasting concoctions of fruit juice, alcohol and water and were
moving on to other drinks.
   According to Impact, a publication of M. Shanken Communications
Inc. that tracks the wine business, cooler shipments grew only 6
percent to an estimated 72.6 million cases in 1987. Industry
executives said at an average price of about $3.50 for a four-pack,
that put the retail value of the category at about $1.5 billion.
   But the 1987 growth rate was well below that in each of the
previous three years in which the category rocketed from a few
million cases in 1983. Impact said the category grew 65 percent in
1986 after tripling the previous year and soaring more than fivefold
in 1984 when California Cooler first encountered serious competition.
   Analysts said a slowdown in such growth was inevitable.
   ``Maybe for some people it was a fad,'' said Jon Fredrikson,
president of Gomberg, Fredrikson and Associates, wine industry
consultants in San Francisco. ``But we believe there are hard-core
wine-cooler drinkers out there who will continue to drink these
products.''
   Marvin Shanken, editor and publisher of Impact, said he also
thought the category would survive and recently predicted it would
amount to 133 million cases annually by the year 2000.
   They each cited the category's appeal to women drinkers and
others who prefer an light-alcohol alternative to beer.
   The short-term outlook is unclear, however. Shanken refused to
estimate growth prospects for 1988 and Fredrikson said the market
may be flat.
   William Slone, president of Beverage Media Ltd., a trade
publisher, said, ``A lot of people have their fingers crossed, but
we haven't seen any upturn in that market yet. Among retailers,
there is no expectation of any meaningful growth this year.''
   Seagram's Wine Coolers, from Seagram Beverage Co. of New York,
nosed ahead of Bartles & Jaymes from E.&J. Gallo Winery of Modesto,
Calif., last year, according to Impact. California Cooler from
Brown-Forman Beverage Co. in Louisville was third, followed by Sun
Country, made by Canandaigua Wine Co. of a town by that name in New
York.
   Seagram ended its two-year association with Willis, the star of
the television series ``Moonlighting,'' by mutual agreement this
year, said Mark Taxel, a Seagram executive. He said Willis helped
Seagram ``get to where we are in the market, but our needs now are
more complex.''
   He said Seagram will use a series of celebrities for different
flavors of its coolers, including its new Lime Mist and Seagram's
Extra. New ads aired so far have featured actors Steve Guttenberg,
Woody Harrelson and Anne Archer.
   Bartles & Jaymes introduced a berry flavor in January and a new
peach cooler in April which, for the first time, was heralded in an
ad featuring Frank and Ed that was not created by Gallo's longtime
agency, Hal Riney & Partners of San Francisco. Riney resigned last
December, and Gallo spokesman Dan Solomon declined to discuss when a
new fulltime agency may be retained.
   California Cooler had put the pulp in its citrus and orange
coolers from the start in the early 1980s to make them look like the
drinks that the today's coolers descended from _ mixtures of fruit
juice and wine poured over huge blocks of ice in tubs on
California's beaches in the 1960s. Its ads once featured songs from
the era, like ``Louie, Louie'' and ``The Bird is the Word.''
   But both the beach party scenes and the '60s classics are gone
from the new ads that use special effects to do things like
transform a cherry into a bottle of its new Wild Cherry Splash
flavor.
   John Shastid, an executive at Brown-Forman, said that while pulp
had been an effective early addition to the drinks, consumers now
realize coolers contain real fruit juice and prefer coolers without
pulp.
   Sun Country dumped the pulp from its flavors, too, saying
consumers were turned off by sediment at the bottom of the bottle.
It has also retired the ad approach that used celebrities in polar
bear costumes to pitch its drink, which now comes in eight flavors,
up from six.
   The steamy ads for its new Strawberry Blush and Wild Jamaican
Rum-Flavored wine coolers made the ABC and CBS networks blush.
Executives demanded revisions in the ads that show scantily-dressed
men and women looking for relief from the heat, and Sun Country
complied.
   Miller Brewing Co., which entered the cooler market with Matilda
Bay last fall, recently introduced its second flavor. Its ads pitch
the only non-carbonated cooler among the majors as a drink from
Australia.
   It is undaunted that another brewer, Anheuser-Busch Inc.,
abandoned the cooler market by discontinuing its Dewey Stevens brand
last year.
   Michael Boykin, brand manager for Matilda Bay in Milwaukee, said
Miller is convinced of the longterm potential of the market.
   ``We think we can be one of the key players in the category,'' he
said.

   In Luxembourg, cars carry the first
``European'' license plates, featuring a replica of a
blue-and-yellow European flag.
   At a rural train stop in northern France a new welcoming sign not
only says the town is French but that France is a member of the
European Economic Community, or Common Market.
   In the Dutch town of Sint-Oedenrode a furniture-manufacturing
plant flies the same flag that is on the Luxembourg's license
plates, and a sticker on a restaurant window in Brussels, site of
EEC headquarters, says: ``My country: Europe.''
   Across much of Western Europe outward signs are multiplying that
the EEC is drawing wider public interest in its quest to create a
true community of nations and, in the view of proponents, gain
greater influence on international economic and political matters.
   Already the EEC is in conflict with the United States and Japan
on some economic issues, and business competition with these two
economic powerhouses and other Western allies is growing in many
areas. The most recent dispute with Washington is over EEC farm
subsidies and their effects on American farmers.
   At the same time, the 12-nation community has been improving
trade ties with the Soviet Union and the communist East bloc _ even
more so than with its Western allies.
   While the 31-year-old organization still is far from its goal of
fully weaving together the economic, social and political fabric of
Western Europe, the integration process in recent years has reached
a new plateau, one from which ordinary citizens can feel involved.
   The community has created its own currency, the European currency
unit (ECU), for bookkeeping purposes but eventually hopes to
circulate the currency for common use among its people. To promote
that idea, the winner of an annual EEC-sponsored tennis tournament
is paid in an ECU check which can be cashed for another EEC national
currency.
   It's still not clear how far the EEC can go with its drive for
greater European unity.
   Some of its members, including Britain and Denmark, show little
desire to go beyond the creation of a simple common market in which
goods and people can move freely across national frontiers. Others
are dedicated to a grander goal: a Europe with a single political
identity, or, as its founders liked to put it, a United States of
Europe.
   Whatever the approach, the pool of money available for joint
spending is limited. The members devote less than 2 percent of their
national incomes to the EEC budget, which this year totals $55
billion.
   Even the more modest goal of ending national barriers to trade
has been beyond the EEC's reach. Some European leaders say this is
the organization's most damning failure, although most believe the
bloc will meet its latest self-imposed deadline of 1992 for removing
these barriers.
   An EEC study published in May said creation of a genuine common
market by 1992 would mean a 4.5 percent boost in economic growth for
the region, a 6 percent drop in consumer prices and 1.8 million new
jobs.
   The study said the European economy could save as much as $320
billion over an unspecified ``medium term'' by achieving an
integrated market.
   Despite its slightly blurred vision of the future, the EEC
appears to have found new success in persuading people that the
slow, tedious process of European integration is more than a
bureaucratic exercise.
   Opinion polls show a slight increase in recent years in public
support for the idea of European unification, although most people
still have only a vague notion of what the EEC is and how it
operates.
   A poll of people in all member nations late last year indicated
that 85 percent thought their country's membership in the group was
a good thing. A 1983 poll put the figure at 79 percent, and in 1980
it was 76 percent.
   In some ways the effort to make people feel attached to the aims
and affairs of the EEC is seen by its leaders as their most
important task.
   In the early years of this decade, the Common Market was mired in
a seemingly endless dispute over internal finances. Decisions on
other matters fell far behind schedule. Nothing seemed to be getting
done, and all the while people saw high inflation and growing
unemployment.
   This was more than just another weak moment for an organization
that had survived many while remaining largely on track.
   A turnaround began in June 1984. At a meeting in the 16th century
Fontainebleau Chateau outside Paris, the EEC government leaders
resolved their budget wrangle, although other money problems cropped
up later.
   Of possibly more lasting significance was a decision at that
summit meeting to launch what was called a ``People's Europe''
campaign.
   The leaders at Fontainebleau recognized that the EEC's problems
went deeper than the money debate. They saw a need to make the whole
integration process appear relevant to individual citizens, to make
people believe that the EEC's aspirations were bound up with their
own.
   ``We're putting Europe back in gear,'' Gaston Thorn, then the
EEC's chief executive, said when the Fontainebleau Accords were
announced.

   Among the programs created under the ``People's Europe''
initiative are a system of grants to university students wishing to
study in an EEC country other than their own, and the introduction
of new European symbols such as the flag and an anthem (Beethoven's
``Ode to Joy'').
   The grants programs was given the name Erasmus (European Action
Scheme for the Mobility of University Students) to recall the 16th
century Dutch humanist who was one of the great figures of the
Renaissance.
   Since Fontainebleau, the Common Market has suffered many
setbacks, including debilitating battles over its budget and failure
to find a way of reducing the region's high jobless rate of 10.4
percent, which is nearly double the U.S. rate of 5.4 percent.
   Its ambitious and costly plans for boosting the economic
competitiveness of backward regions in Europe also have been largely
disappointing. About one-sixth of the total EEC budget is devoted to
these efforts.
   Yet the EEC has scored many successes.
   Some of the significant ones:
   _Bringing Spain and Portugal into the organization Jan. 1, 1986.
In political terms, this was aimed at strengthening democracy in two
nations that only a decade or so earlier had shed dictatorships. It
also gave the EEC a combined population of 320 million, boosted itsride,
calling
his historic candidacy a ``catalyst for growth.''
   Republican George Bush, who has the GOP nomination in the bag,
expressed eagerness to face Dukakis in the fall. He said the two
have many differences and ``I am ... on the right side.''
   Dukakis said today there may well be ``a floor fight or two''
with Jackson and his supporters at the Democratic National
Convention next month, but he added, ``I don't see any great
divisions within our party.''
   He said the United States ``must go far beyond our current
sanctions'' against South Africa. But he stopped short of calling
South Africa a terrorist nation, a label demanded of Dukakis and the
party by Jackson.
   Dukakis said he and Jackson talked in general terms of Jackson's
post-primary role in the party during a meeting last night, but he
would not give details. He said the vice presidency was not
discussed.
   The four-month presidential primary season closed today with
races in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana. All three
presidential contenders were in California today, and all were
staying in the state tonight to wait out the results of the day's
contests.
   Early turnout was reported light in New Jersey and moderate in
New Mexico.
   The biggest prize is California, and an ABC News tracking poll
indicated Dukakis led Jackson in the state by a 2-1 margin, 61
percent to 30 percent. The survey, based on 415 interviews Saturday
and Sunday, had a margin of error of 6 percentage points, the
network reported Monday night.
   California officials were predicting a low turnout, however.
Secretary of State March Fong Eu said she expected a turnout of 48
percent, which would be the lowest in more than 40 years.
   Before today's voting began, Dukakis had nearly 1,900 delegates,
leaving him fewer than 200 shy of the 2,081 needed to nominate. On
Monday alone, more than 70 delegates flocked to the Dukakis camp.
Jackson trails with less than 1,000 delegates.
   There were 466 delegates at stake in today's primaries.
   In addition, Dukakis' former rivals for the nomination were
lining up behind him. Campaign sources said Dukakis would travel to
Missouri on Wednesday, the day after the last primaries, to pick up
Rep. Richard Gephardt's endorsement. The same day, the sources said,
Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois was to endorse the Massachusetts
governor in Washington.
   Dukakis' wife, Kitty, was following it all from her hospital bed
in Boston, where she was recovering from spinal surgery. ``I think
Michael will do well and I'm hoping by the eighth of June that he
will have sewn up the convention,'' she said.
   Dukakis, not noted for his effusiveness, nonetheless sounded like
a happy man as he headed into the final contests.
   ``I'm really overwhelmed by the good feeling, the spirit, the
confidence. A sense of victory is in the air,'' he said as he
campaigned Monday in Los Angeles.
   Jackson, however, suffered a primary-eve embarrassment when he
missed the first 16 minutes of a live half-hour statewide broadcast
that was supposed to showcase his campaign and provide a platform
for a dramatic final appeal.
   The show's host, radio disc jockey Casey Kasem, was left to
conduct an awkward interview with Jackson's state campaign chairman
and show repetitive video montages of the campaign. When Jackson
finally arrived he appeared calm, but was perspiring profusely as he
outlined his positions.
   Although Kasem had repeatedly referred to Jackson's lateness
during the first half of the broadcast, the candidate later
contended ``we really came in on time'' because Kasem filled the air
time. Jackson said he thought the broadcast went well.
   Dukakis went to Jackson's Los Angeles hotel room for a late-night
meeting Monday night. Neither man would comment to reporters after
the hour-and-a-half meeting, and Dukakis walked tight-lipped through
a crush of reporters in the lobby.
   Jackson told The New York Times in an interview published today
that he had ``earned the option'' to be offered the vice
presidential spot. He had said previously he deserved consideration
for the post.
   In recent weeks, Jackson has been looking ahead to the convention
and pressing his platform demands. But he has also been looking back
at the most successful presidential campaign ever waged by a black
candidate. Jackson said his candidacy has helped build racial
tolerance.
   ``It's clear America has become more and more accustomed to Jesse
Jackson as a possible next president,'' he said Monday. ``It's a
matter of growth. I'm the stimulus. I'm the catalyst for that
growth.''
   Bush, meanwhile, got a primary-eve boost of sorts from the Reagan
administration. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel announced Monday
night that he was suspending plans for a controversial oil-drilling
project off the California coast.
   Earlier this week, in what was then a step away from the
administration, the vice president called for a delay in the
project. The two Democrats oppose it outright, and Dukakis had
faulted Bush for failing to do likewise.
   Bush, speaking to a Republican audience on Monday, said he
``can't wait for this primary season to end'' so he can go
head-to-head with Dukakis.
   For Bush, the primary season has been over for some time. He
clinched the 1,139 delegates he needed for the GOP nomination back
in April. But the Republican competition effectively ended three
months ago, when the vice president racked up landslide wins across
the South.

   The stock market declined slightly today, running
into resistance from sellers after its sharp rally over the past
week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 118 points
over the past five sessions, dropped 5.69 to 2,069.52 by noontime
today on Wall Street
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 595 up, 712 down and
519 unchanged.
   Interest rates rose in the bond market today. Prices of long-term
government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest
rates, fell about $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Analysts said the pressure on bonds stemmed largely from
inflation worries that have increased with rising commodity prices
of late.
   Brokers said uncertainties over inflation and interest-rate
prospects helped to discourage traders from chasing after stocks
with the popular averages near the high end of the trading range in
which they have fluctuated for the past several months.
   Some computer and semiconductor issues gained ground. Digital
Equipment rose 1| to 109}; International Business Machines ] to
114}; Motorola ] to 50[ and Hewlett-Packard { to 57].
   Egghead Inc. traded at 18} on heavy volume in the

<HEAD>European Experts Meet on Pollution Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARLSKRONA, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts from eastern and western Europe
met in this port city Tuesday in an attempt to sort out the
pollution problems that are plaguing the Baltic and the North seas.
   A carpet of algae spread in recent weeks along the Norwegian and
Swedish coasts, killing farm trout and salmon worth millions of
dollars and causing unknown damage to wild fish. An epidemic of a
herpes virus has killed hundreds of seals in Danish and German
waters this spring.
   Pollution from farms, sewers and industry was suspected in both
cases.
   About 175 delegates from Sweden, the Soviet Union, Finland,
Poland, West Germany, East Germany, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands
and Britain were attending the three-day meeting, said spokesman
Torsten Wikstrom.
   The timing of the conference, coinciding with the algae plague,
``was not meant that way,'' said Wikstrom. But he said the algae was
a main topic on the first day of talks.
   Farmers from all countries represented have been blamed for heavy
use of fertilizers, which eventually find their way to the seas, and
some municipal governments will face costly outlays for better
sewage treatment if the seas are to be cleaned up.
   Harald Velner, executive secretary of the Helsinki Commission,
singled out the Soviet Union and Poland as major polluters. But
Wikstrom said the meeting has mostly been free of recriminations.
   The delegates included local, regional and national politicians
as well as marine experts

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices slipped in early trading today as
investors apparently refocused their attention on negative economic
signals.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was down 15-32 point, or
nearly $4.70 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price, rose to 9.1 percent from 9.05 percent late
Monday.
   Analysts said there was no news to send the market downward, but
they suggested investors who ignored economic signs during a
four-day rally last week might again be concerned about inflation
and other factors.
   ``It's behaving more in lines with the (economic) fundamentals
today,'' said Maury Harris, an economist at PaineWebber Inc.
   ``The market has been rallying here for a couple of weeks without
any particular reason,'' said Robert Brusca, an economist at Nikko
Securities Co. International.
   ``I would have to chalk it up to normal, unexplainable bond
market dynamics,'' he said of today's performance.
   Some analysts attributed the recent run-up to technical factors.
During the rally, bond traders ignored soaring commodity prices, a
harbinger of higher inflation that usually leads to credit market
declines.
   Bond traders fear inflation because it erodes the value of
fixed-income securities and can lead to higher interest rates.
   Some commodities prices were sharply higher in early trading
today.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds today, prices of
short-term government issues were unchanged to 1-32 point lower,
intermediate maturities fell between [ point and 5-16 point, and
long-term issues were down ] point, according to Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.24 to 109.41. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 1.89 to
1,145.65.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities were down \ point
in light trading, according to the investment firm Salomon Brothers
Inc.
   However, Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which
measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of
five years or longer, rose 0.19 to 279.58.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were up 1 basis point at
6.44 percent. Six-month bills rose 1 basis point to 6.72 percent and
one-year bills were unchanged at 7.02 percent. A basis point is
one-hundredth of a percentage point.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 7 5-16 percent, up from 7\ percent late Monday.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Injunction in Eastern Shuttle Sale</HEAD>

   A federal appeals court today set aside a
contempt of court order against Eastern Airlines and an injunction
barring the company from selling its Northeast shuttle to another
subsidiary of its parent Texas Air Corp.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled that U.S. District
Judge John H. Pratt failed to make proper factual findings when he
held Eastern in contempt for taking steps to sell the profitable
Eastern Air Shuttle to a newly created subsidiary of Texas Air.
   The deal was challenged by the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, which contended the sale
would violate the terms of a July, 1987 injunction that Pratt had
issued in another labor dispute involving Eastern.
   The IAM, which represents 13,000 Eastern employees, contends that
Texas Air is trying to break up the airlines' various components to
weaken the power of the unions at the financially troubled carrier,
which Texas Air purchased in 1986.
   A unanimous three-judge panel dissolved the injunction issued by
Pratt that bars Eastern from proceeding with plans to sell the
Boston-to-New York-to-Washington shuttle to another subsidiary of
Texas Air for $225 million.
   It also set aside the modified injunction Pratt issued barring
the sale, but gave the union 10 days to seek a temporary restraining
order to stop the deal. The court directed Pratt to hold a factual
hearing to determine if an injunction is warranted.
   The court, in an opinion by Judge Harry T. Edwards, held that the
July 1987 injunction Pratt issued barring Eastern from transferring
6,000 ground-crew workers into a subsidiary called Airport Ground
Services did not prohibit the shuttle deal.
   Thus Eastern could not be held in contempt of the 1987 order for
taking steps to transfer ownership of the shuttle.
   ``In issuing the March order, the district court did not weigh
the tradiitonal equitable criteria, nor did it make factual
findings, necessary to support the issuance of a new or modified
injunction,'' Edwards wrote in an opinion joined by Judges Stephen
Williams and Louis Oberdorfer.
   ``We appreciate the district court's concern that Eastern's
announcement of the shuttle deal may have suggested a disregard for
the spirit of the July injunction,'' Edwards wrote. ``Nonetheless,
this is an insufficient basis upon which to rest a finding of
contempt where the district court has issued a new or modified
injunction.''
   IAM spokesman Jim Conley said the union had no immediate comment
because its lawyers had not yet studied the decision.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said ``we are pleased with the
decision and are studying its implications.''

   In the Soviet Union, some bureaucrats in effect
``are saying the public be damned,'' said Soviet economist Stanislav
Menshikov. The bureaucracy is sabotaging reform.
   Sitting nearby, American economist John Kenneth Galbraith was
reminded of how rigid bureacuracry can be in America, too, not just
in government but in the private sector as well.
   ``It reminds me of Galbraith's first law of executive
management,'' said the Harvard professor. He paused, then stated the
law: ``Businessmen inevitably become like their products.'' Consider
the folks who ran the U.S. steel industry, he suggested.
   Like a vaudeville team working the boards, this unlikely duo
produce a lively dialogue in support of their new book _
``Capitalism, Communism and Coexistence'' _ comparing and
contrasting capitalism and communism, forecasting and analyzing, and
feeding cues to each other.
   They have had a lot of training. Both are accomplished
economists, wise and witty, serious but colorful, of sufficient
stature to state their positions with verve and confidence. And they
have, since last summer.
   Discussing economics for 10 days at Galbraith's Vermont home,
they literally talked into existence their joint volume, which has
been published simultaneously in the United States (by Houghton
Mifflin) and in the Soviet Union.
   It defies the notion that serious economics needs to be dull.
   ``Each afternoon we met to consider our topic for the next
morning; each morning we took up one of the subjects that gives
title to one or more of the chapters in this book,'' Galbraith says
in the introduction.
   The deeper purpose, he continues, ``was to show that an American
and a Russian of different views could engage in civil and, we
hoped, informative discussions of our different and common
problems.''
   The discussions were informed, of course, but more notably they
were amazingly frank. Americans familiar with Galbraith expect that
from him. But most Americans are unaccustomed to hearing a Soviet of
the same sort.
   Menshikov, a former United Nations official, member of the staff
of the Communist Central Committee and author of books such as
``Millionaires and Managers,'' is now on the staff of World Marxist
Review, published in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   ``We don't represent an official view,'' Menshikov said of
himself and his partner. ``I wrote this as an independent person.
It's my view.''
   In his view, and Galbraith's also, the economies of the two
nations are in a period of critical change, with both facing huge
problems of production, trade, budgeting and bureaucracy, to name a
few commonly shared issues.
   ``There is a reassessment for both systems,'' said Menshikov as
he and Galbraith relaxed after promoting their book on an morning
television show.
   ``Socialism is in a period of crisis or pre-crisis,'' Menshikov
continued. It's not a crisis in the sense that somebody is going to
die, ``but the old ways of operating the system is no longer
valid,'' he said.
   ``Once they might have been valid,'' he continued. ``It was
probably right for building up heavy industry,'' he said, but he
seemed to suggest that today's more open lifestyle and economy might
benefit from consumer items, too.
   Changes must be made, Menshikov said, seeming to feed a cue to
Galbraith, who responded: ``In both systems there's a tendency to
say: `We're comfortable, we're on the right track.'''
   Bureacracy was common ground for the authors.
   Galbraith saw grave weakenesses in the American industrial
structure. He expressed concern about the response to foreign
competition. He commented on the bureaucratic neglect that allowed
trade and budget deficits to develop.
   ``Ours is more dangerous,'' said Menshikov about the Soviet
bureaucracy. ``It acts in the name of the state.'' It is more
dangerous than corporate bureacracy because ``in a corporation you
have some competition.''
   But you must beware of either kind, Menshikov said. ``Bureaucracy
leads to ossification and stagnation. We've had a stagnant economy
for some time.''
   ``We have 17 million bureacrats,'' he continued. ``What can you
do with them?'' If you threaten to fire them they would merely fire
others first. ``We must eliminate their power to give orders to
plant managers. We must stop the meddling.''
   Perhaps, Menshikov suggested, we should pay them but not listen
to them.

<HEAD>London Index Off 12.5 Points</HEAD>

   Share prices settled lower Tuesday, erasing most of
the previous session's gains.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
12.5 points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,820.2. The index rose 13.5 points
on Monday.
   Volume was a robust 557.4 million shares, compared with Monday's
380.2 million shares.
   Dealers said London players were keeping a close eye on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average was 8.53 points lower
at 2,066.68 as the London session drew to a close.
   ``There's concern and lingering doubt whether we have really seen
a turn in the U.S. market over the past week, and that has prevented
people from chasing the market higher,'' said Bob Semple, a market
strategist at County Natwest WoodMac Ltd.
   The Dow Jones average soared more than 114 points last week.
   Semple and others said investors are concerned that British
officials might try to engineer another hike in interest rates soon.
   On Monday, the Bank of England signaled a half-point rise in the
commercial banks' base lending rate to 8.5 percent, the second gain
in less than a week.
   The interest rate worries ``aren't quite over yet, so we're just
marking time and consolidating,'' Semple said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 7.7 points at 1,445.1
at the close, while the 500-share index fell 6.04 points to close at
1,026.55.

   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is chipping away at its mammoth trade surplus</1ST_LINE>
<2ND_LINE>y expanding imports and overseas investment but the United States</2ND_LINE>
<TEXT>
   has yet to adequately address its own foreign trade imbalance, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Tuesday.
   In a report on Japan's foreign trade in 1987, MITI said
structural changes in the country's economy, combined with the yen's
appreciation against the U.S. dollar, have led to increased imports
and a slowing of growth in exports.
   ``Japan's industrial structure is becoming geared to domestic
demand,'' said Atsushi Oi, director of the ministry's International
Trade Research Office. ``Manufactured imports are increasing rapidly
and the distribution system is undergoing a change.''
   Imports of manufactured goods rose to $73.9 billion in fiscal
1987 from $55.2 billion in fiscal 1986, fueled primarily by the
rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen, according to government
statistics.
   But the report warned that the budget and trade deficits of the
United States, as well as other international imbalances, ``are
having a dampening influence on trade and investment by causing
exchange rate fluctuations and destabilizing market prices.''
   Some economists say the period of sharp reductions in Japan's
trade surplus is at an end. While the surplus has been declining
compared with last year's levels, the seasonally adjusted trade
surplus has lately been increasing from month to month.
   Oi said the United States could reduce its trade deficit by
slashing runaway consumer demand, expanding production facilities
and revamping its export policy.
   The ministry report urged major industrial countries to
coordinate their economic policies more closely in light of today's
rising economic interdependence.
   ``International policy coordination is essential to the effective
resolution of imbalances,'' said Oi, whose office compiled the
report, which has been issued annually since 1949.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tuesday that Japan's
exports to the United States will fall from the present 40 percent
of Japan's total exports to 25 to 30 percent of total exports. He
did not predict how long it would take for that to happen.
   Spurred by the rapid rise in the value of the yen, imports of
consumer goods from the European Economic Community rose by 26.3
percent in 1987 over the previous year, the trade ministry said.
   Those from the newly industrialized countries of South Korea,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore soared by 50.3 percent in the same
period, according to the trade report.
   By comparison, imports of U.S. consumer goods rose only 8.4
percent.
   Since early 1985, the yen has risen by more than 100 percent
against the U.S. dollar, making Japanese exports more expensive
overseas but boosting Japan's import buying power.
   Oi said Japan is prepared to import more manufactured goods from
Asian nations and step up direct investment in the region.
   He said Asia's newly industrialized countries have depended on
the U.S. market for their development, ``but it will be difficult to
continue to depend on exports to the United States.''
   To offset the burden on U.S. markets, Japan was prepared to help
by absorbing more Asian products and offering technological and
economic assistance, as well as stepping up direct investment, he
said.

   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
and European Economic Community officials agreed Tuesday to step up
trade contacts.
   Takeshita responded favorably to a suggestion by EEC Commission
President Jacques Delors to create a panel of experts to discuss
technical aspects of the EEC's rocky trade relations with Japan,
officials said.
   Takeshita also stressed the need for Japan and the 12-nation EEC
to widen their relations beyond trade to cultural and scientific
sectors.
   ``The relationship between Europe and Japan is not very strong or
as well developed'' as that between the United States with Europe
and Japan, an aide to Takeshita told reporters.
   Senior EEC and Japanese officials meet annually. An EEC official
said Delors believed regular meetings of experts could be useful in
defusing trade tensions.
   The EEC is conducting numerous investigations of allegations of
dumping by Japanese exporters.
   The EEC official, who asked not to be named, said EEC Foreign
Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq noted a ``remarkable improvement
in trade relations'' between the 12-nation trade bloc and Japan,
even though the EEC continues to register a large trade deficit with
Japan.
   The gap shrank by 4 percent in 1987, but was still $25 billion.
   For his part, Takeshita said the EEC's plans to turn the 12 EEC
states into a single, borderless market by the end of 1992 was good
for Japan.
   But his aide quoted him as saying, ``The ... single market after
1992 should be the one which is open to the outside world'' and that
the EEC should remove restrictions on Japanese exports.
   But he dismissed the idea of reciprocity in trade, an issue the
EEC has given high priority in order to gain greater access for
European goods to the Japanese market.
   ``We fully understand what (the EEC) Commission people are saying
on reciprocity but Japan cannot agree to reciprocity on a sectoral
basis,'' Takeshita was quoted as saying.
   Among specific trade issues discussed were Japan's high taxes on
imported liquor and cars, the difficulties of foreign companies'
bidding on Japanese public works projects and better access for EEC
exports of telecommunications hardware and semiconductors.
   The EEC side also urged Japan to liberalize its banking sector.
Officials said Delors stressed European banks must be able to
establish themselves in Japan to make it easier to finance European
exports and investments.
   De Clercq also called on Japan to quickly comply with a General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ruling to amend an accord with the
United States on trade in semiconductors. The world trade body has
ruled the deal discriminates against the EEC.
   Takeshita also asked Delors' advice as to the best way to
distribute $500 million Japan has earmarked as special economic
assistance to Africa.
   ``We are aware that European countries have a long relationship
with African countries,'' the aide quoted Takeshita as saying.

<HEAD>ILO: Unions, Governments Do Little Against Child Labor</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Illegal exploitation of child workers is widespread
in much of the Third World, and most national trade unions do little
to combat it, according to a report released Tuesday by the
International Labor Organization.
   The report by the Geneva-based group said some governments fail
to enforce bans against child labor and even facilitate exploitation
because industries that employ children can be important earners of
foreign exchange.
   Some experts cited in the report estimate that at least 100
million boys and girls are employed worldwide, many of them younger
than 10 years old and many unpaid.
   Those who are paid for their work ``rarely receive an income even
approaching the minimum wage,'' the survey said. ``They receive no
fringe benefits, insurance or social security payments ... child
workers are the lowest paid but work the longest hours.''
   The 226-page report noted that such conditions give employers a
competitive advantage abroad. Regional studies included in the
report said some exporters in India and Egypt would rather cease
trading than replace children with adult labor because of the cost
of the switch.
   The report deplored the ``almost total absence of initiatives by
national workers' organizations in the campaign against child
labor.''
   ``Because the exploitation of child workers can be a threat to
their economic interest and because it constitutes a violation of
the rights and dignity for which labor has campaigned all along,
workers' organizations have a particular obligation to promote and
assist in the campaign against child labor,'' the report said.
   Recent efforts by the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions and by Britain's Trade Union Congress are the ``almost sole
exceptions,'' the report said.
   Case studies in the report acknowledged efforts made in India,
Brazil, Colombia and the Philippines and said child labor was
virtually eliminated in Hong Kong following improvements in social
security benefits and education policy.
   But the report said that in much of the Third World, child labor
continues to be ``widely prevalent _ in agriculture, industry, and
services _ despite national legislation prohibiting it.''
   Payment in many industries is made upon completion of a specified
task or period, it said.
   In Peruvian gold mines and in deep sea fishing operations off the
Philippines, medicines, supplementary food, and working days lost
because of illness are deducted from the pay, according to the
report. Children, more likely to suffer occupational injuries, may
be indebted to the employer at the end of the contract.
   Fifteen years ago, the confederation set a mimimum age of 12 or
13 for ``light work.'' But a study on child labor in the quarries
and brickyards of Peru found the majority of the children working
there started ``even before they were eight years old,'' the report
said.
   The report said that in Kenya, family labor involved around 90
percent of all children between six and 15 years of age and was
common in both rural and urban areas in a large variety of tasks,
from washing clothes to the sale of crops on local markets.

   A major international law firm said Tuesday it
will pay the salaries of 125 young lawyers each year who are are
willing to work for the poor for two years after law school.
   For five years beginning next June, Skadden, Arps will funnel $10
million to qualified public service organizations to pay the
salaries of Skadden Fellows.
   The lawyers would provide legal services in civil law for poor
people deprived of civil or human rights and who, unlike persons
accused of crime, are not guaranteed counsel by the Constitution.
   The program also will instill in the lawyers a taste for pro bono
_ public benefit _ work, said Peter P. Mullen, executive partner of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the firm.
   The program will take the form of fellowships that pay about
$32,500 a year plus fringe benefits, comparable to second-year
salaries of federal judicial clerks, said the announcement from
Skadden, Arps.
   Twenty-five Skadden Fellows will be named each year for the next
five years and each will serve about two years.
   ``There are many lawyers interested in and capable of dealing
with the legal problems the disadvantaged encounter, and there are
many organizations that provide needy persons with legal services,''
said Mullen. ``The problem has been that the organizations lack the
funds to provide enough lawyers to fill the need, much less at a
reasonable salary.''
   A graduating lawyer applying for the fellowship must find a
public service organization willing to employ him.
   Skadden, Arps, founded 40 years ago, has 177 partners and 675
associates in seven major U.S. cities and in London and Tokyo.

   Intel Corp. of Santa Clara and Siemens
AG of Munich, West Germany, said Tuesday they have formed a
joint-venture international computer company to be headquartered in
Hillsboro, Ore.
   The new company will be called Biin (pronounced byne) and
``complement the business strategies of both Siemens and Intel,''
the chief executives of both companies said.
   Biin will offer ``computer systems for mission-critical computing
applications worldwide,'' the companies said. Intel spokeswoman Pam
Pollace declined to be more specific, but said its products would
fit into the category that includes computerized manufacturing,
patient care, reservation systems and automatic tellers.
   Intel manufactures microcomputer components, modules and systems;
Siemens is one of the world's largest electrical and electronic
companies.
   Ownership of the new company will be split 50-50, said Andrew S.
Grove of Intel and Karlheinz Kaske of Siemens.
   Named to head Biin was Joseph J. Kroger, former vice chairman of
Unisys Corp. and before that the chief executive officer of Sperry
Corp., which was merged with Burroughs Corp. in 1986 to create
Unisys.
   While Hillsboro will be the new company's world headquarters, its
European base will be in Nuremberg, West Germany. Biin is expected
to begin production at both sites by the end of the year, the
announcement said.
   Ms. Pollace declined to comment on the size of the company or how
many employees it would have.

   The Reagan administration's nominee to fill a
vacancy on the Interstate Commerce Commission assured a Senate
committee Tuesday that she would not vote automatically for less
regulation of the transportation industry.
   ``A blind reliance on deregulation and minimal government
interference cannot always be relied upon to promote the public
interest,'' Karen Borlaug Phillips told a Senate Commerce, Science
and Transportation Committee hearing on her nomination. ``Less
regulation does not necessarily mean no regulation.''
   Phillips, 31, the chief economist for Republicans on the Senate
Finance Committee, was praised by GOP members of the commerce panel.
   But several Democrats questioned her sharply about her views on
the adequacy of government regulation of the trucking and railroad
industries.
   Sen. John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va., the sponsor of legislation
that would make it easier for shippers to obtain government help in
forcing railroads to lower their rates, complained that ``monopoly
is allowed free rein'' by the ICC in some instances today.
   ``The result can be rail rates for hauling grain that are too
high, rates for hauling coal that are too high, higher food and
utility bills for consumers across the country,'' he said.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., a former secretary of transportation,
argued against deregulation of the trucking industry.
   ``I don't think it's safe now. I don't see weigh stations open,
and I don't see inspections taking place,'' Adams said.
   Phillips said she favors further deregulation of the trucking
industry, and has ``a very open mind, generally, on rail matters.''
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., chairman of the Commerce Committee's
surface transportation subcommittee, said he supports Phillips'
nomination.
   ``I believe on balance, this nomination by the president is about
as good as we could expect,'' he said after the hearing.
   Phillips was nominated to the $77,500-a-year job on Feb. 29. She
would replace Commissioner Malcolm M.B. Sterrett, whose
five-year-term expired Dec. 31.

   The stock market drifted lower today, running
into resistance from sellers after its sharp rally over the past
week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 118 points
over the past five sessions, dropped 4.62 to 2,070.59 by 2 p.m.
today on Wall Street
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 699 up, 722 down and 516
unchanged.
   Interest rates rose in the bond market today. Prices of long-term
government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest
rates, fell about $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Analysts said the pressure on bonds stemmed largely from

   Tenneco Inc., the nation's 10th biggest oil
company, said Tuesday it has received several offers for its oil and
gas operations since putting them up for sale two weeks ago.
   A spokesman declined to discuss details of any of the offers, but
financial analysts have estimated the units could fetch between $5
billion to $7 billion.
   Joseph M. Macrum, the Tenneco spokesman, also would not identify
any of the bidders, except to confirm that an offer had been
received from Gulf Financial Resources Inc., a private Houston-based
investment firm financed by European interests.
   Gulf Financial said Monday that it had sent Tenneco Chairman
James L. Ketelsen a letter asking for a meeting to discuss details
of its undisclosed cash offer.
   Tenneco announced on May 25 that it wanted to get out of the oil
and gas business to concentrate on its shipbuilding, farm equipment,
auto parts and chemicals operations. It said it would use the
proceeds to reduce its $8.5 billion debt.
   Tenneco Oil Co., Tenneco's energy subsidiary, had operating
income of $233 million on sales of $3.3 billion last year.
   Henri A. Soussan, a principal in Gulf Financial, would not reveal
the offered price or other details concerning the proposal, which
was made to Tenneco in a letter last Wednesday.
   He said the offer was for both the exploration and production and
the refining and marketing operations of Tenneco Oil.
   ``We plan to keep them as one entity in an ongoing company,''
Soussan said. ``We intend to retain the senior management and all
employees.''
   Soussan declined to identify the European interests that back his
company. He said Gulf Financial was formed two years ago to make
real estate acquisitions but had yet to make a purchase.
   Macrum said Gulf Financial was one of ``many'' firms that had
expressed an interest in acquiring the oil and gas units.
   ``We have received more than anticipated,'' Macrum said. He said
he did not have a definite number, but said ``it's a lot, very
extensive.''
   The sale is being handled by the investment banking firms Morgan
Stanley Corp. and First Boston Corp.
   Macrum said the firms are reviewing offers to determine whether
the bidders have the financial resources.
   ``At some point, then we will call for bids and we will evaluate
them. We will then name a winner. We hope to do that by the end of
the year,'' he said.

   Earnings at the nation's commerical banks are
rebounding from the worst year since the Depression in every region
of the country except the Southwest, the government said Tuesday.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said the 13,541 banks it
insures collectively earned $5 billion in the first three months of
this year, down somewhat from $5.3 billion in the same period in
1987.
   However, earnings would have hit a new record high if not for the
huge $1.49 billion loss at a single Dallas bank holding company,
said FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman.
   Banks' first quarter losses in the Southwest totaled $1.64
billion, 90 percent of that from First RepublicBank Corp.
   The FDIC has already pumped $1 billion into First RepublicBank,
Texas' largest banking organization, and may have to spend another
$1 billion to attract a buyer to take it over.
   Seidman said the FDIC is negotiating with potential investors and
hoped to put First RepublicBank back on its feet in the ``reasonably
near future.''
   Last year was the worst since the Depression for commercial
banks: 184 banks failed, a record high, and banks as a whole earned
only $3.6 billion, a record low, as big banks added to their
reserves in anticipation of losses on loans to developing countries.
   Banks this year are continuing to fail at the 1987 rate.
Seventy-five had closed their doors as of last Friday, 32 of them in
Texas.
   But otherwise Seidman painted a generally optimistic picture for
1988.
   The number of banks on the FDIC's problem list has dropped below
1,500 for the first time in two years, he said. There were 1,491
such institutions at the end of March, compared with a peak above
1,600 in mid-1987.
   The big money-center banks have written off about 25 percent to
30 percent of their Third World loans and that alone was responsible
for much of last year's depressed earnings. Those reserve levels
still look reasonable, he said.
   Prospects are also looking up for banks in the Midwest, a region
where banks were affected by hard times on the farm. The percentage
of Midwest banks reporting losses fell from 13.5 percent in the
first quarter a year ago to only 7.6 percent this year.
   Even in the Southwest there is reason for hope, Seidman said.
Twenty-seven percent of the banks in the region lost money in the
first three months of this year, compared with 36 percent for all of
last year.
   ``We expect the worst for Texas will be behind us after 1988,''
he said. ``The smaller banks in Texas are beginning to show some
improvement. Nothing large, but they are moving in the right
direction.''
   Seidman also said he believed nationally banks were ``reasonably
well protected'' against rising interest rates and could withstand a
recession next year, provided the downturn is not extraordinarily
deep or extended.
   He described his agency's insurance fund as ``solid,'' even
though the price tag on the First RepublicBank bailout may cause the
fund to register its first loss since it was established in 1934.
   ``We think we can handle anything we see on the horizon,'' he
said.
   Despite record failures and record low earnings, commercial banks
are still in far better shape than the 3,120 federally insured
savings institutions, which lost $6.8 billion last year. First
quarter figures are not yet available for thrifts.

   The chairman of Amtrak said Tuesday he is
confident the passenger railroad will survive and gain the support
of the next president, whether Democrat or Republican.
   ``Congress has rejected ... proposals to terminate Amtrak for
four successive years,'' W. Graham Claytor told reporters, referring
to repeated attempts by the Reagan administration to end federal
subsidies for the railroad.
   Amtrak is expected to get about $580 million in federal money
next year but will cover two-thirds of its operating costs through
various revenue sources, Claytor said. Only 48 percent of the rail
system's costs were covered by revenues in 1981, he said.
   The administration repeatedly has called for an end to federal
subsidies for Amtrak, but each time Congress has continue to provide
the rail system with reduced amounts of money.
   ``Today ... things are looking better,'' said Claytor, expressing
optimism about getting the additional federal funds in future years
that will allow Amtrak to begin expanding its operations.
   He said he expects either Democrat Michael Dukakis or Vice
President George Bush to support Amtrak if elected president,
although Bush has yet to say specifically whether he would favor
increased funding for the railroad.
   Claytor said his key objective is to have both the Democratic and
Republican parties go on record as supporting the continuing need
for a national passenger rail system. ``I'm optimistic this will be
the position of a new administration, whether Republican or
Democratic,'' he said.
   While in recent years Amtrak has battled for its survival,
Claytor talked during a session with reporters at the National Press
Club about expanding services in the years to come.
   ``The principal problem we see ahead is capacity. ... On weekends
and hoidays we don't have the equipment to accommodate peak loads on
our unreserved Northeast Corridor trains'' between Boston and
Washington, he said.
   Claytor said that for the first time in recent years Amtrak has
been on firm enough footing politically to obtain financing for new
locomotives and train cars.
   He said Amtrak has arranged financing for the purchase of 18 new
diesel and electric locomotives and up to 100 new coach cars. ``The
locomotives are now being delivered and the first 50 coaches will be
on hand in 12 to 15 months,'' he said.

   Corn futures advanced strongly while soybeans
surrendered most of their gains in late trading Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat opened sharply higher but faded quickly and was down the
rest of the day.
   With limit gains in all agricultural commodities on Monday and
healthy gains in recent weeks, the markets were ready for profit
taking, said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Trading in soybeans was extremely volatile with a sharp upturn on
the opening, an almost immediate selloff, a quick recovery and then
a fast fade at the end.
   A midday, forecasts of cooler temperatures for the Corn Belt may
have triggered some of the price losses, said Spilka.
   ``But mainly,'' he said, ``prices have been going up so much that
traders have made enough money and were willing to sell; and selling
tends to touch off further selling.''
   On the close, wheat was 5} cents to 14 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.77 a bushel; corn was 5 cents
lower to 12{ cents higher with July at $2.57 a bushel; oats were 8
cents to 15 cents higher with July at $2.21{ a bushel; and soybeans
were 16\ cents lower to 4{ cents higher with July at $8.80 a bushel.

   The dollar finished slightly lower Tuesday in
what traders said was a delayed reaction to news that West Germany's
central bank had sold the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices also fell. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $458.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
$463.25 an ounce late Monday.
   Traders said investors continued to sell dollars as a
``follow-through'' to a report Monday that the Bundesbank had
quietly sold at least $2 billion during the last week of May. Such a
move lowered its huge dollar reserves and helped slow the dollar's
recent rise.
   ``There was some spillover activity from that,'' said David
Godwin, chief foreign-exchange dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland's
New York office.
   In addition, traders have begun squaring up their positions ahead
of the government's report on U.S. merchandise trade figures for
April, due to be released next Tuesday.
   ``Some banks seem to be scaling up their estimates of the trade
deficit,'' noted Stephen Flanagan, an assistant vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. The higher estimates spurred traders
to sell dollars and take their profits.
   Manufacturers Hanover is forecasting an April deficit of $12.3
billion, higher than earlier rumors that pegged the shortfall at $10
billion, Flanagan said.
   One bank was rumored to have predicted the deficit will be in the
$14 billion range, Flanagan said, which further depressed demand for
the dollar.
   ``The market is trying to feel where we will find good support,''
he said. ``The dollar will be on the softer side for the remainder
of the week ahead of the trade numbers.''
   The dollar also declined in quiet European dealings.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins, the
dollar fell 0.30 Japanese yen to a closing 125.77 yen. In late
London trading it was quoted at 125.80 yen.
   At the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar had fallen
to 125.52 yen, down from 125.76 yen on Monday.
   The British pound strengthened following Monday's increase of
half a percentage point in British interest rates. In London,
sterling gained just over a penny to trade at $1.8130, up from
$1.8025 late Monday.
   In New York, it cost $1.8138 to buy one pound, more expensive
than Monday's $1.8006.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.7113 West German marks, down from 1.7134; 1.4254 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4279; 5.7818 French francs, down from 5.8015;
1,271.65 Italian lire, down from 1,273.88, and 1.2283 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2321.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.7143 West German marks, down from 1.7190; 1.4277 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4357; 5.7910 French francs, down from 5.8122;
1.9245 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9303; 1,273.10 Italian lire, down
from 1,277.65, and 1.2318 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2324.
   Gold finished at $460 a troy ounce on New York's Commodity
Exchange, down from $463.25 on Monday.
   In London the metal was unchanged from late Monday, fetching a
late bid price of $463.50 a troy ounce. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold
was lower, closing at a bid of $463.50, down from $464.50 late
Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 36 cents to close at a bid of
$464.03.
   Silver on New York's Comex fell to $7.237 a troy ounce from
$7.270 on Monday. In London the metal was unchanged from Monday at
$7.34 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Government Announces Sale of State-Owned Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday that it would offer the
state-owned bank, Girobank, for sale to a financial institution.
   Girobank, formally National Giro, is Britain's sixth-largest
bank. It was set up in 1968 to cater to the banking needs of
working-class Britons and is now part of the Post Office.
   Industry Minister Kenneth Clarke announced the government's
latest privatization in the House of Commons, saying the bank ``now
needs to expand vigorously.''
   The sale of the bank, which analysts said could raise 300 million
pounds, or about $543 million, is expected to take place by the end
of the year.
   Merchant bankers will be in charge of assessing the bids for
Girobank under the guidance of the Post Office.
   The bank, which has about 2.5 million customers, had pretax
profit last year of 23.1 million British pounds, or about $42
million, on revenue of 328 million pounds, or $594 million.
   ``It will ... be important to safeguard close links between
Girobank and Post Office counters,'' Clarke said.
   Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has previously
ruled out the privatization of the nation's mail delivery service,
but not of other postal operations.
   In addition to the bank and the Royal Mail, the Post Office also
oversees a subsidiary which runs the counters where stamps are sold,
parcels weighed and banking services provided.
   Opposition lawmaker Tony Benn, who as Labor government Postmaster
General launched Girobank 22 years ago, said the privatization of
the bank was a ``naked act of plunder'' of a public asset which had
been ``wildly successful''.
   Although the offer price will be a major factor in deciding who
takes over the bank, it will not simply be sold to the highest
bidder, Clarke said.
   The government will also look at the bidders' plans for
developing the bank, the impact of the sale on the Post Office and
other factors, he said.
   Clarke signaled government opposition to a takeover of Girobank
by any of the ``Big Four'' commercial banking companies: National
Westminster Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC and Lloyds
Bank PLC.
   Girobank is primarily used as a savings bank by retired and poor
people who don't need all the services of a retail bank.
   Girobank issues checks and has post office hours, which are
longer than bank hours. It is also used to pay gas, electricity and
other bills, as well as to wire money within Britain and abroad.
   Girobank has reached a new five-year contract with the counters
subsidiary through which it operates, Clarke said.
   Mrs. Thatcher has sold off billions of pounds worth of
state-owned assets, primarily through the sale of shares to the
public, as a way of promoting capitalism in Britain.
   Companies sold off include British Telecommunications PLC, the
phone company which also used to be run by the Post Office.

   An Arab investment bank said Tuesday it has
acquired a nearly 50 percent stake in Gucci of Italy, the luxury
goods company, from Morgan Stanley International for an undisclosed
sum.
   The investment bank, Arab Banking Corp., is based in Bahrain and
is known as Investcorp.
   Morgan Stanley, the U.S. investment bank, had acquired the shares
in Gucci, a maker of luxury handbags, shoes, clothes and fashion
accessories, in a series of transactions from members of the feuding
Gucci family over a period of eight months, said Andrea Morante, a
Morgan Stanley official.
   Florence-based Gucci was was founded by Guccio Gucci in the early
1900s as a saddlery business and has been controlled by his
grandsons.
   Investcorp said separately that it was buying a stake in Gucci's
U.S. affiliate but didn't elaborate on the size of the stake
involved.
   A joint statement issued in London by Investcorp and Morgan
Stanley said the remaining 50 percent of the Italian company is held
by Maurizio Gucci, one of the founder's grandsons. Italian
authorities have issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of
violating Italy's foreign currency regulations.
   Maurizio Gucci's holding currently is being supervised by Italian
court-appointed custodians.
   A shareholding of less than 3 percent is held by Roberto Gucci,
another of the founder's grandsons.
   Paul Dimitruk, a member of Investcorp's management committee,
said Investcorp isn't currently pursuing the acquisition of the
additional Italian Gucci shares.
   ``We are looking forward with confidence to a long, stable and
harmonious ownership relationship with the other shareholders and
the company''s current operating management,'' Dimitruk said.
   Investcorp, whose shares are mainly held by investors from the
Persian Gulf Arab states, is a small investment bank which
specializes in taking short- and medium-term stakes in relatively
small, well-known companies. Its recent investment activities
include a major stake in the U.S. jeweler, Tiffany and Co.
   The Italian company had 1987 sales of about 220 billion lire
($180 million), and the American arm had sales of $150 million last
year.
   Gucci also has separate distribution companies in London, Paris
and Hong Kong.

<HEAD>Corn Up Sharply, Soybeans Push Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures advanced strongly and soybeans finished slightly
higher despite some earlier profit taking Tuesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures, on the other hand, fell by a nickel or more per
bushel.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy
was higher; and precious metals declined.
   On Monday, prices on all six agricultural commodities had soared
the daily permissible limit at the opening at the Board of Trade and
stayed there as hot, dry weather in the Midwest showed no signs of
letting up.
   By contrast, commodities futures prices were very volatile on
Tuesday, particularly in soybeans.
   ``Nonetheless, the performance was impressive,'' said Rich
Feltes, commodity research director in Chicago for Refco Inc.
   Soybeans had increased more than $1 a bushel in the last week and
had two consecutive sessions of 30 cent-limit gains going into
Tuesday's session.
   Prices opened sharply higher again, sold off almost immediately,
staged a comeback and then faded near the close.
   ``The market was up so sharply, it was due to pull back,'' said
Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co.
   ``Traders have made enough money and were willing to sell, and
and selling tends to touch off further selling,'' he said.
   By day's end, the July soybean contract had traveled between a
high of $9.09 a bushel to a low of $8.66 and closed with a 3-cent
gain over Monday at $8.82.
   Wheat futures prices fell, however. Weekly crop reports released
late Monday showed the deterioration in the winter wheat crop, which
is about to be harvested, was not as severe as had been expected,
said Jerry Gidel, an analyst in Chicago with G.H. Miller & Co.
   Wheat settled 4} cents to 14 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.78 a bushel; corn was 9 cents to 12} cents
higher with July at $2.57\ a bushel; oats were 6 cents to the limit
15 cents higher with July at $2.21{ a bushel; and soybeans were 10{
cents lower to 3 cents higher with July at $8.82 a bushel.
   With a relatively subdued performance in grains, some upward
price pressure was taken off livestock futures at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Over the last few sessions, the distant delivery months of pork
and cattle have been pushed higher by the cost of grain, said
Charlie Richardson, an analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock & Co. He
said traders felt higher feed costs would reduce production of
broilers and competition for red meat.
   Hog producers also were expected to slow expansion.
   ``So, with the grain market not nearly as wild as it was the last
two sessions, we had some pressure relieved'' on livestock prices,
said Richardson.
   Live cattle settled .50 cent lower to .85 cent higher with the
June contract at 73.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .75 cent to
1 cent higher with August at 75.92 cents a pound; live hogs were .77
cent lower to .50 cent higher with June at 52.92 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were 1.25 cents lower to 1.35 cents higher with
July at 54.87 cents a pound.
   Energy futures moved slightly higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Prices were merely rebounding from sizable technical losses the
day before, said Nauman Barakat, an analyst in New York with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``In addition,'' he said, ``there are some rumors that OPEC is
going to work out some compromises.'' Ministers of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in Vienna beginning Saturday.
   ``There's been some talk they'll attempt to get Iraq back as an
active member of the cartel,'' he said. ``And also rumors that
they're ready to restart a dialog with non-OPEC nations.''
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 11 cents
higher with the July contract at $17.37 a barrel; heating oil was
.25 cent to .46 cent higher with July at 46.23 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .10 cent to .47 cent higher with July at 50.20
cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures were lower on the Commodity Exchange in
New York.
   Gold settled $2.90 to $3.40 lower with the June contract at $460
a troy ounce; and silver was 3.5 cents to 3.8 cents lower with July
at $7.28 a troy ounce.

   Texaco Inc. on Tuesday promised to give its
stockholders a third of the $5 billion it expects to raise from
asset sales as part of its bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   The White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant said the distribution
would come in the form of a share buyback or some other ``direct
shareholder participation or distribution,'' and would be made by
the end of this year.
   ``The distribution may involve cash or the use of securities, in
anticipation of the proceeds to be realized from the sales
program,'' Texaco said in a statement.
   It added that the other two-thirds of the proceeds would be used
to repay debt, strengthen the balance sheet and fund increased
capital investment programs for selected retained operations.
   Wall Street showed little response to the move, which came in the
midst of a proxy fight between Texaco and takeover specialist Carl
C. Icahn.
   In consolidated nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues Texaco closed at $51 per share, up 12{ cents.
   ``It's negative from the stock market's view, because it's not
like they're giving the shareholders something they don't already
own,'' said Richard S. Pzena, who studies oil companies for the
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. securites firm.
   Icahn is running a five-man slate for the board of directors,
hoping to a victory will help him get the board to let shareholders
vote of a $60-per-share cash offer for the company. The votes are to
be cast at Texaco's annual meeting on June 17.
   Pzena said that by adding some value to shares already hovering
in the $50 range, Texaco in effect was diluting the impact of
Icahn's $60 cash offer, thereby strengthening its chances of beating
Icahn in the proxy fight.
   That amounted to a negative on Wall Street, because ``$60 is
better than $50,'' Pzena said.
   Icahn claimed Texaco's objective in the move was ``to do just
enough to get reelected and then get back to business as usual.''
   ``Unfortunately, Texaco management will promise almost anything
to keep me off the board and keep stockholders from voting for $60
or better,'' he said in a statement.
   Texaco's latest announcement updated its progress in other
aspects of its reorganization plan. It came just 24 hours after it
said it had agreed to sell its 99.12 percent interest in Deutsche
Texaco AG of West Germany to a major utility in that country.
   Rheinish-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk AG, also known as RWE,
agreed to pay over $1.2 billion for the subsidiary. Both sides
expect no problems with a requirement that West Germany's Federal
Cartel Office approve the transaction.
   In its Tuesday announcement, Texaco said it expected to generate
more than $1.8 billion more in two other upcoming transactions. One
is a deal to sell 60 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent
reserves, expected to close by the end of this month. The other
involves proposals to establish joint ventures with certain
oil-producing countries.
   The ventures, which were ``in advanced stages of review,'' would
involve three Texaco refineries and related marketing facilities on
the East and Gulf coasts.
   Texaco President James W. Kinnear said the two other countries
are Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.
   The company also said studies were continuing on what to do with
its 78 percent interest in Texaco Canada Inc., including the
possible sale, merger or joint venture of some or all of the stake.
   In addition it said it was considering the potential sales of
other domestic oil and gas properites of marginal value to the
company, as well as certain European and African holdings.
   Finally, the restructuring program is expected to yield more than
$50 million in additional savings in overhead from staff
consolidations, Texaco said.
   The latest developments are a result of months of negotiations
that began as Texaco prepared for its April emergence from a year
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection.
   Texaco had filed for that protection a year earlier to avoid
having to post an $11 billion security bond while appealing a $10.3
billion judgment held against it by Pennzoil Co. A jury ruled Texaco
had interfered with Pennzoil's 1984 attempt to acquire part of Getty
Oil Co. so it could buy Getty itself.
   Texaco agreed in December to settle the suit by paying $3 billion
to Pennzoil as part of a restructuring plan that included sales of
$3 billion worth of assets.
   Soon afterward, Icahn, its largest stockholder with 14.8 percent
of the company's shares, stepped up pressure on Texaco's management
to do more to increase the value of its stock.
   In March, he threatened to run his slate of five candidates,
including himself, for Texaco's board, if the company did not take
steps that would raise the price to $55 per share from then-current
levels in the $35-to-$45 range.
   In an apparent bid for stockholder support, Texaco announced the
restoration of its dividend and an expansion of its planned asset
sales to $5 billion a month later.
   But Icahn, unsatisfied, proceeded with his $60-per-share offer
for those Texaco shares he does not already known, and launched his
threatened proxy fight.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's savings and loan
rescue policy is aimed at protecting the customer's money and
preserving the public's confidence in the system, a White House
spokesman said Tuesday.
   At the same time, Marlin Fitzwater insisted there was no plan to
resort to the use of general taxpayers' funds to bail out troubled
institutions. He pronounced the White House satisfied with the way
the federal regulators are handling the problem.
   But Fred Wolf, director of accounting and financial management of
the congressional General Accounting Office, said that, considering
the state of the industry, the federal government might have to use
general taxpayer revenues to shore up the system.
   Wolf said some 500 savings and loans across the country are
insolvent, and 200 of them are ``what we would classify as
hopelessly insolvent.''
   Fitzwater acknowledged that ``clearly, we've got some difficult
problems in that industry.'' He commented a day after the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. ordered a record $1.35 billion cash
bail-out payment to customers of two failed California savings and
loans.
   The $1.35 billion figure represents roughly 40 percent of the
FLSIC fund for financial institution rescue attempts. Analysts have
said it likely will cost billions more than is in the budget to bail
out other institutions.
   Fitzwater, when asked about how the bank regulatory agency could
withstand such financial pressures, said FSLIC has $10.8 billion in
borrowing authority over the next three years.
   He took issue with estimates it likely would cost as much as $50
billion to put the industry back on a steady course.
   ``A lot of the S&Ls that are in trouble are being bought out by
other companies. A lot of them are in bankruptcy and they're trying
to work out arrangements for them to stay in business. So, I don't
think it's fair to suggest that we're suddenly have a $50 billion
bill.
   ``This is not a new problem and it's one that is being planned
for and the regulatory agencies have been handling it well and
effectively,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``But be assured tha protecting the customers' money and the
public's confidence in the system is the first priority of the
regulatory agencies. And that's the way they're approaching it. And
I think they have a very rational scheme for doing that,'' Fitzwater
added.
   He would not say where the money would come from, however.
Pressed to say whether taxpayers' money might eventually be used,
Fitzwater said, ``Well, right now we think the regulatory scheme is
_ the regulatory complex is the right way to approach thismoney.
There is a trust fund, money goes into it from the banks and from
the member S&Ls, and, at this point that's adequate, and we think
the right way to handle it.''
   In an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' Wolf said
the government would continue to stand behind the nation's troubled
savings and loan institutions, but that eventually could mean having
to turn to the taxpayers for more money.
   ``I don't know of any other source you could tap,'' Wolf said.
``The federal government has clearly said that regardless of the
problems ... we stand behind the insurance.''
   But, considering the state of the industry, if savings
institutions are not able to supply the money needed by the
insurance fund, ``there's only one other source, and that's
ultimately the taxpayer,'' Wolf said.
   Fitzwater said: ``Right now the situation is being managed, and
we'll leave it at that.''

<HEAD>Jury Begins Deliberations In Cigarette Liability Case</HEAD>

   Deliberations began Tuesday in the case of a
widower suing three tobacco companies over the lung-cancer death of
his wife, who smoked cigarettes for 40 years.
   The verdict in the 5-year-old case _ one of a dozen cigarette
liability cases ever to go to a jury _ could maintain the $22
billion industry's unbeaten record in such suits or grant the first
damages paid to smokers or their relatives.
   The six-person jury contains one smoker, two former smokers and
three people who have never smoked.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin read instructions on the law
and claims that the panel must consider. Sarokin told five alternate
jurors to remain on hand in case any jurors drop out.
   The jurors deliberated for more than four hours before being
dismissed for the night.
   The panel must decide charges by Antonio Cipollone that Lorillard
Inc., Liggett Group Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. contributed to the
death of his 58-year-old wife, Rose, in 1984.
   Cipollone contends the companies misled the public about the
dangers of smoking through public relations, advertising and
inadequate research.
   Sarokin told the jurors they must decide four basic claims:
fraudulent misrepresentation and conspiracy to do so against each
company, and failure to warn and violation of a warranty against
Liggett.
   The warning and warranty claims apply only to Liggett because
Mrs. Cipollone smoked that company's cigarettes before warning
labels were placed on cigarette packages and advertising in 1966.
Courts have ruled that the labels pre-empt liability claims after
that date.
   Sarokin framed the main charge as a claim that the companies
``fraudulently misrepresented material facts to consumers concerning
significant health risks associated with cigarette smoking.''
   He said the jury has to determine five things _ that before 1966
the company made a false representation; that the company knew the
representation was false; that the company meant to deceive people;
that Mrs. Cipollone believed the representation, justifiably relied
on it and was induced to continue smoking; and that the
representation was a ``proximate cause'' of her cancer and death.
   The phrase ``proximate cause'' played a key role in the jury
instructions. Sarokin said the panel has to consider whether the
companies' conduct before 1966 was a proximate cause of her smoking,
and then whether the smoking was a proximate cause of her death and
disease.
   The legal term means activity that ``naturally and probably led
to and might have been expected to'' create the condition alleged,
Sarokin wrote. Cipollone doesn't have to prove thatthe companies'
conduct was the only or even main reason why she smoked, only that
it was a ``substantial contributing factor.''

<HEAD>SEC Not Probing Most Foreign Insider-Trading Cases, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has been
unable to handle a flood of foreign-based insider trading cases
referred to it in recent years, according to information compiled by
a House subcommittee.
   An investigation by the House commerce, consumer and monetary
affairs subcommittee, whose results were made available Tuesday,
concluded that of 609 suspected insider-trading cases referred by
the stock exchanges to the SEC in 1986 and 1987, about 225 involved
foreign trading.
   Of the 225, the SEC pursued only 57, the study said.
   ``With the growing internationalization of securities markets,
there is deepening concern that both foreign citizens and Americans
will be able to use foreign accounts to trade illegally in our
markets by utilizing insider trading information or manipulating the
market, and that the SEC may be unable to properly investigate such
trading,'' subcommittee Chairman Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., said in a
statement.
   According to the study's findings, the nation's stock exchanges
often take a long time to report suspicious transactions to the SEC.
The New York Stock Exchange takes an average of one year to give
such information to the SEC and has taken up to 28 months, the panel
concluded.
   New York exchange spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said she would not
challenge the figures in the report, but said the exchange conducts
its own investigations and is trying to speed the process it uses to
gather and report information on unusual transactions.
   The investigation concluded that the SEC does not pursue cases
involving Panama, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein and other countries with
whom the commission lacks information-sharing agreements.
   The subcommittee also found that the SEC has been looking into
suspected instances of insider-trading involving International
Business Machines Corp., Textron Inc., Sperry Corp. and other
companies.
   Barnard, whose subcommittee scheduled a hearing on the subject
for Wednesday, said in his statement that the SEC has given a low
priority to international enforcement by assigning only two people
to its Office of International Legal Assistance.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined to comment on the study,
saying commission Chairman David S. Ruder would testify at
Wednesday's hearing.
   But in Tuesday's edition of the Wall Street Journal, which
initially reported the subcommittee's findings, Gary Lynch, the
SEC's enforcement chief, said of the commission's international
efforts: ``We've been very aggressive, and have made remarkable
strides in the last several years.''
   The SEC on Tuesday released a draft of proposed legislation
designed to increase its ability to combat insider-trading and other
securities law violations by foreigners.
   The bill would give the SEC authority to issue subpoenas and take
testimony in the United States on behalf of foreign securities
regulators with the idea that other countries, in turn, would
provide the same assistance to the SEC.

<TEXT>
   USG. Corp. has rescheduled for July 8 a vote by
its stockholders on a defensive recapitalization and business
restructuring plan it proposed to counter a takeover attempt by a
Texas partnership.
   The vote was originally scheduled for a special meeting on June
24, but was rescheduled on Monday by USG's board for July 8 at 9 a.m.
   USG said in a statement it was delaying the vote to give
stockholders extra time to consider proxy materials relating to the
proposed recapitalization.
   The plan, announced May 2, would give stockholders $37 in cash,
$5 in 16 percent pay-in-kind junior subordinated debentures and one
new share of common stock, USG said in a release.
   The company would take on $2.2 billion in new debt to pay for the
recapitalization, aimed at warding off a takeover attempt by Desert
Partners LP, a partnership headed by two Texas oilmen.
   USG also announced that, at Desert Partners request, the federal
appeals court in Chicago had delayed the partnership's appeal on a
ruling upholding USG's shareholder rights plan. The appeal was put
off until after the shareholders' vote next month.

   International bankers and businessmen said Tuesday
that the stage was being set for the eventual creation of a
universal banking system, which would offer a variety of financial
services to customers around the globe.
   For one thing, regulatory barriers that separated investment and
commercial banks, such as the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act in
the United States, were being abolished or re-examined, Rainer E.
Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse in Zurich, told the International
Monetary Conference.
   He said the bank of the future will have to change its business
strategy by becoming more competitive and aggressive.
   ``In the 1990s, the typical manager in a successful universal
bank, will be globally oriented, have a flair for market
opportunities, and possess entrepreneurial instincts,'' Gut said in
prepared remarks made available to the news media.
   The three-day monetary conference, in its 34th year, provides
leaders of the top commerical banks and corporations in about two
dozen countries an opportunity to confer with government officials
on topics affecting the world economy and international banking.
   Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan and other central
bankers from abroad were scheduled to attend Wednesday's closed-door
session.
   Much of Tuesday's session focused on the U.S. banking system with
some conference participants criticizing the inconsistencies between
domestic and foreign regulations.
   ``Effective governance, both domestic and international, has not
kept pace,'' American Express Co. chairman James D. Robinson III
told the conference.
   ``Our sites must be set on achieving an environment in which all
types of financial institutions can compete with adequate rules of
fair play _ a credible regulatory framework,'' he said.
   Robinson said all financial institutions should have fair access
to the global markets while countries work together to harmonize
otherwise outdated regulations.
   Later, at a media briefing Tuesday, several bankers, including
John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the nation's biggest banking
company, briefly discussed the level of regulation among global
institutions.
   Philadelphia National Bank Chairman Frederick Heldring said big
banks that take risks shouldn't always expect government protection.
   ``We ultimately could come to a form of Chapter 11'' federal
bankruptcy reorganization, Heldring said. ``If a bank is too large
to fail, it is subject to the risk of becoming an arm of
government.''
   Reed agreed, ``It makes us more vulnerable to becoming bullied by
the regulators.''
   He noted that while government regulators look at the role banks
play in society, ``the sociology doesn't play in the management
room. We should be allowed to fail as anyone else.''

   The U.S. electronics industry
announced Tuesday it will seek to re-enter the consumer business
lost to Japan by playing a major role in the projected $40 billion
world market for a new generation of televisions.
   Calling the effort to catch up to Japan in advanced television
research a ``last window of opportunity,'' the American Electronics
Association said it is forming a task force to explore a possible
alliance of industry, government and academia.
   At a meeting Monday of more than 50 computer, semiconductor and
telecommunications industry leaders, government officials and
academic researchers, a consensus was reached in five areas:
   _The U.S. electronics industry should be in the consumer business.
   _Advanced television, which is expected to deliver stunningly
realistic images and sound, means more to the electronics industry
than just re-entering the consumer market.
   _Advanced television will drive the leading edge technologies,
such as advanced semiconductors.
   _An open system of design should be used rather than one that
locks in specific parameters and specific manufacturers.
   _A broadcast standard should be adopted that is advantageous to
U.S. manufacturers, broadcasters and consumers.
   ``We found that the implications for ATV (advanced television)
for our industry and for the economic well-being of the country are
pervasive,'' said Pat Hill Hubbard, vice president of the
3,500-member AEA.
   ``One point stressed throughout the meeting,'' he said, ``was the
non-participation in this market by the U.S. electronics industry
will mean the loss of our leading edge research and, in turn, our
ability to compete in the emerging global marketplace.''
   Companies attending the electronics powwow included AT&T,
International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Motorola
Corp., Apple Computer Co., National Semiconductor Corp., Advanced
Micro Systems Inc. and Intel Corp.
   Among the government officials was Al Sikes, assistant secretary
of Commerce for communication and information policy.
   ``We hope this is a catalytic meeting for what is to be done,''
said Ralph Thomson, senior vice president of the AEA, which hosted
the meeting at its headquarters.
   ``We're talking about how we got to where we aren't,'' he said
wryly, ``and finding out where we want to go.''
   Where they aren't, he said, is in consumer electronics, a
multibillion-dollar industry pioneered by U.S. companies but now
dominated by Japan.
   The group Monday talked about whether high-definition television,
which the Japanese have been working on for several years, will
revolutionize the TV industry and spin off as many other
technologies as did videotape and digital recording.
   ``We're reminding ourselves of the stakes involved,'' Thomson
said. ``There's a whole lot more involved here than TVs. We're
talking about a whole electronics era. The tone in the room is
leading us to the conclusion it is a revolution in electronics.
That's certainly AEA's conclusion.''
   Although it is unusual to have competitive companies in the
United States meet to discuss broad technological ventures, and to
have government involved as well, such meetings are common in Japan.
   ``The Japanese have been at it for 20 years, and they're way
ahead of us on this technology,'' Thomson said.

<HEAD>Coleco Denies It Has Sold Outdoor Toy Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled Coleco
Industries Inc. denied a published report Tuesday that it has sold
its lines of plastic outdoor toys for an estimated $30 million.
   Barbara Wruck, a Coleco vice president, said the report of a sale
to Hasbro Inc., the country's largest toy company, was premature.
However, Coleco said in a statement that it has ``already received
offers for the sale.''
   ``We do intend to find a purchaser for that product line. The
company has not announced anything official at this point,'' Wruck
said.
   Coleco also said Tuesday that its short-term lenders have
extended to June 30 an interim financing arrangement that expired on
June 1.
   The extension is intended to provide the company with funds as it
tries to reduce and restructure its bank debt through the sale of
assets and to arrange for new working capital.
   The Hartford Courant, quoting industry analysts and Coleco
sources, said Coleco had reached an agreement to sell the lines that
helped launch the company more than 30 years ago.
   The newspaper said Hasbro had an agreement to buy the product
lines and the New York State plant where they are produced in
partnership with an unidentified Canadian investor.
   According to the newspaper, Coleco executives told workers of the
sales agreement during an employee meeting at the company's
headquarters.
   Wayne Charness, a spokesman for Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro,
declined to comment on the newspaper report.
   Coleco lost $47.4 million in the first quarter of this year, and
has been in default on the interest payments on $335 million of its
debt securities.
   Paul C. Meyer, Coleco executive vice president for finance, said
he was notified Tuesday that investors owning about $120 million of
those bonds had withdrawn a previous demand for immediate repayment.
   Coleco has offered to exchange the $335 million in bonds for a
combination of new bonds and common stock, but the orginal terms of
that offer were rejected by investors. The company has extended the
offer to June 30.
   The product lines to be sold, the newspaper report said, include
plastic wading and splashing pools, pool filters, children's outdoor
furniture and clubhouses, and pedal-powered and battery-operated
cycles.
   Those lines, which helped launched Coleco in the toy business in
1956, had sales last year of $77 million and are produced at plants
near Albany, N.Y., owned or leased by Coleco.

   The Food and Drug Administration has
approved the use of the artifical sweetener aspartame in six new
food categories, the NutraSweet Co. announced Tuesday.
   Aspartame, marketed as NutraSweet, now may be used in yogurt-type
products, refrigerated flavored milk beverages, ready-to-serve fruit
juices, refrigerated ready-to-serve gelatin desserts, fruit wine
beverages and frozen desserts, the company said in a statement.
   ``I expect some of these products to be in stores and markets in
the near future,'' said Robert B. Shapiro, chairman and chief
executive officer of NutraSweet Co.
   Shapiro said the FDA approvals were ``another affirmation of the
increasingly important role of NutraSweet in the diets of
health-conscious consumers and their families.''
   He also said the company has been working with its customers
together to develop products in the new categories.
   Aspartame has been used in 1,250 products since it was first
approved in 1981 for chewing gum, the company said.
   NutraSweet Co., headquartered in this northern Chicago suburb, is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Monsanto Co.

   Murray Ohio Manufacturing Corp. said
Tuesday that its board rejected as inadequate a $52-a-share takeover
offer from AB Electrolux of Sweden, and recommended that
shareholders refrain from tendering their stock under the $197
million offer.
   Murray's directors also authorized the company's management to
explore possible alternatives to the Electrolux offer.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Murray fell 50 cents a
share to $62.50.
   Electrolux began a tender offer of $52 a share for all of
Murray's 3.8 million shares on May 24. It had previously proposed
$48 a share.
   In a statement released in New York, Electrolux said it was
``disappointed'' with the Murray board's rejection of its offer, but
said it will continue with it, subject to previously-stated terms
and conditions.
   ``We continue to believe that the acquisition of Murray by AB
Electrolux is in the best interests of Murray shareholders and its
other constituencies,'' the Electrolux statement said.
   Murray is a leading manufacturer of power lawn mowers and
bicycles with a headquarters in Brentwood, a Nashville suburb, and a
plant in Lawrenceburg.
   AB Electrolux is an appliance maker that owns such trademarks as
Frigidaire and Tappan. It has no connection with Electrolux Inc.,
the Marietta, Ga., company which makes vacuum cleaners.
   In announcing Tuesday's action, Murray chairman William M. Hannon
said the board felt ``the Electrolux offer understates the values
represented by the company's shares _ values built by Murray's
long-standing tradition of quality.''
   The company said the directors considered a number of factors in
making their determination, including the opinion of its financial
advisors, Goldman, Sachs & Co.
   Hannon also said the board had amended the company's takeover
defenses to ``enhance Murray's ability to respond to the Electrolux
offer and to develop possible alternatives to it.''

   Financier Kirk Kerkorian disclosed he may sell
his controlling share of MGM-UA Communications, or restructure the
corporation by selling a film production unit and other assets, a
top executive said Tuesday.
   MGM-UA has acknowledged receiving offers from more than one
potential buyer, but none of the suitors have been identified, said
Stephen D. Silbert, MGM-UA's president and chief operating officer.
   ``We have not disclosed that at all,'' Silbert said.
   Asked about reports that N.V. Philips was the leading contender
among several foreign firms interested in acquiring the movie and
television company, Silbert said, ``I really can't confirm or deny
it.''
   Kerkorian filed an amendment Tuesday to an April 6 report to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which stated he was considering
selling all or part of his 82 percent stake in the company.
   Silbert said Kerkorian's amended SEC filing shows he is
considering disposing of his shares as well as considering a
restructuring.
   The restructuring ``could involve the sale of one of the motion
picute production units and additional assets such as interests in
our distribution organizations,'' Silbert said. A substantial amount
of the proceeds would be distributed to stockholders, he said.
   Kerkorian has spent the past two decades buying, selling and
buying back assests of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United Artists
studios. The movie and television conglomerate has been on the
auction block for the past two months.
   The latest transactions involving the two studios occurred two
years ago when Kerkorian sold MGM-UA Entertainment to Atlanta
broadcaster Ted Turner, then bought back UA's distribution
operation. Several months later, Kerkorian bought back the UA film
library for $480 million and then repurchased the MGM name and logos.
   MGM-UA stock rose 37{ cents a share Tuesday to $16.87{ in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange. It was trading at $13.62{ a share on
April 6 when the company first announced inquiries from interested
buyers.

<HEAD>Record Payout for Closed Thrifts; U.S. Productivity Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's thrift industry is showing more signs of strain, but
the government says the productivity of the nation's work force is
still on the rise.
   Federal regulators announced a record $1.35 billion payout to
close two insolvent savings institutions Monday. Meanwhile, the
Labor Department reported a big increase in productivity statistics
for the first quarter.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed American Diversified
Savings Bank and North America Savings and Loan Association, both of
Costa Mesa, Calif., without arranging for a takeover by another
institution.
   Only 10 of 235 failed S&Ls handled since 1981 have been resolved
with a straight payoff of depositors. Usually, the bank board pays a
bonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick S&L or arranges to transfer
deposits to another institution.
   But bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said the thrifts had little
value as going concerns because they had few retail deposits and
lacked branch offices. Both also relied on high-cost, short-term
deposits arranged through brokers, which they in turn lent out for
speculative real estate ventures and other risky investments.
   The institutions have been insolvent for some time. Regulators
took over the management of American Diversified in February 1986
and of North America Savings in January 1987.
   Wall said the bank board is paying $1.14 billion from the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to American Diversified depositors,
the largest cash payout the agency has ever made. It is covering
$209 million in deposits at North America Savings.
   Deposits up to the insurance limit of $100,000 will be available
beginning Tuesday. A total of about $500,000 in both institutions
exceeded the limit. Those depositors will share in liquidation
proceeds.
   In a new economic report, the Labor Department said the nation's
efficiency in churning out goods and services improved more than
four times more rapidily during the first quarter of 1988 than it
did in 1987.
   But average annualized hourly wage gains of only 3.4 percent
failed to put most workers ahead of inflation for the fifth quarter
in a row, it said.
   Not since the spiraling inflation of 1979-81 have workers gone
that long without an improvement in their standard of living through
wage gains, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Productivity among the nation's non-farm businesses increased at
an annual rate of 3.6 percent during January through March.
Preliminary figures last month had put the improvement at only 0.9
percent. But those earlier figures were issued before the gross
national product _ the broadest measure of economic growth _ was
revised upward.
   In another sign of improving economic conditions, the number of
Americans late on their mortgage payments fell to the second-lowest
level of this decade during the first three months of the year, a
trade group of lenders reported.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association said the number of mortgage
payments late by 30 days or more dropped to 4.78 percent of total
mortgages in the first quarter, down from 4.95 percent in the last
three months of 1987.

<HEAD>Texaco Sells West German Subsidiary For Slightly More Than $1.2
Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN C. GIVEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. has agreed to sell its West German
subsidiary to that country's largest utility in a deal worth
slightly more than $1.2 billion, the two companies said.
   The sale of Texaco's 99.12 percent interest in Deutsche Texaco AG
to Rheinish-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk AG, also known as RWE,
represents the first part of a $5 billion restructuring plan by this
nation's third-largest oil company.
   RWE said at its Essen headquarters that it would pay $1.23
billion to close the deal, which was signed Monday in Luxembourg and
which is subject to approval by the West German Federal Cartel
Office. Both sides said they expected no problems with the German
authorities.
   It will become effective five days after the permission arrives,
probably by the end of the month, RWE spokesman Friedhelm Gieske
said.
   Texaco began negotiating the sale months ago, as it prepared for
its April emergence from a year under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
protection.
   The White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant had filed for that
protection a year earlier to avoid having to post an $11 billion
security bond while appealing a $10.3 billion judgment held against
it by Pennzoil Co. A jury ruled Texaco had interfered with
Pennzoil's 1984 attempt to acquire part of Getty Oil Co. so it could
buy Getty itself.
   In December, Texaco agreed to settle the suit by paying $3
billion to Pennzoil as part of a restructuring plan that included
sales of $3 billion worth of assets.
   Soon afterward, takeover artist Carl C. Icahn, its largest
stockholder with 14.8 percent of the company's shares, stepped up
pressure on Texaco's management to do more to increase the value of
its stock.
   In March, he threatened to run a slate of five candidates,
including himself, for Texaco's board, if the company did not take
steps that would raise the price to $55 per share from then-current
levels in the $30-to-$40 range.
   Texaco, in an apparent bid for stockholder support, announced the
restoration of its dividend and an expansion of its planned asset
sales to $5 billion a month later.
   But Icahn was not satisfied. Recently, he offered $60 per share
for those Texaco shares he does not already known, and launched his
threatened proxy fight for the five seats on the company's board.
The results will be announced at Texaco's annual meeting on June 17.
   Texaco's stock, meanwhile has continued to hover at levels near
$50 per share, as Icahn kept up his attacks on its management.
   Commenting on the Deutsche Texaco sale, James W. Kinnear,
president of the parent company, apparently had those criticisms in
mind.
   ``The proceeds from this transaction, together with those from
other imminent asset sales and joint venture partnerships, will be
providing real benefits to our shareholders,'' he said in a
statement. ``We are committed to significantly enhancing the value
of our shareholders' investment.''
   Exactly how Texaco shareholders would benefit from the sale,
Kinnear did not say. There has been speculation that it might issue
a special dividend to shareholders or disburse the proceeds in some
other manner.
   On Monday, Texaco's stock rose 87{ cents a share to close at
$50.87{ in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   As part of its restructuring, Texaco has also been negotiating
the sale of 60 million barrels of U.S. oil and natural gas reserves,
and has been talking with Saudi Arabia about establishing joint
ventures involving East- and Gulf-coast refining and marketing
interests.
   RWE, West Germany's eighth-largest corporation, is active in the
production and supply of electricity, brown coal mining, and the
petroleum and chemicals businesses, Texaco said.
   It said it acquired Deutsche Texaco, in the mid-1960s. The German
company is active in all phases of the oil business, from
exploration and production to petrochemicals.
   It owns two refineries, capable of producing 140,000 barrels
daily, and holds a 10.2 percent share of the West German retail
gasoline market, with about 1,900 Texaco-branded retail outlets
throughtout the country.

<HEAD>Bass, Macmillan Move Buyout Battle To The Courtroom</HEAD>

   The courtroom is likely to be the scene of the
next encounter between Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass and
Macmillan Inc., the giant publishing company he has offered to buy
for $1.9 billion, or $73 a share.
   Bass filed a lawsuit Monday after Macmillan failed to respond to
his latest offer, but Macmillan had already filed its own suit
charging Bass with securities laws violations.
   ``Going to court clearly makes this unfriendly, but it already
really was,'' said Bruce Thorp, an analyst with Provident National
Bank in Philadelphia.
   On Wall Street, Macmillan jumped $3.50 a share to $75 in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Analysts were nonplussed by the legal developments and said it is
likely the Bass suit will delay the restructuring dividend Macmillan
plans to begin paying shareholders on Friday.
   The Macmillan board, which rejected Bass's initial $64-a-share
offer as inadequate, adopted a plan to split the company's
publishing and non-publishing operations into two separate, publicly
owned corporations.
   Part of the plan includes paying shareholders a special dividend
of $52.35 a share.
   In a suit filed Monday in Chancery Court in Delaware, Bass is
seeking to block the company from proceeding with the payout.
   In what analysts characterized as a further attempt to appease
management, Bass alternatively offered to restructure the company
along the lines of a plan Macmillan unveiled last week, but on terms
more favorable to shareholders. He is offering a payout of $58 a
share.
   Bass representatives made the proposals at a meeting over the
weekend with Macmillan's investment bankers and requested a response
by noon Monday.
   But Macmillan allowed the deadline to tick by, saying in a
statement it would consider the proposal ``later in the week.''
   In its suit filed Monday morning in federal court for the
Southern District of New York, Macmillan charged Bass with
``repeated filing and public dissemination of misleading statements
... in order to engage in creeping tender offers ...''
   The suit further claims that the defendants were ``so anxious to
hide their intent, to deceive Macmillan and its shareholders, and to
manipulate the market in Macmillan shares, that on or about Oct. 13,
1987, the broker who was placing defendants' orders for Macmillan
shares falsely stated that he was acting on behalf of Macmillan
itself.''
   The Bass group holds about 9.1 percent of Macmillan's roughly 26
million outstanding shares. The stake was built between August 1987
and last month, according to the lawsuit.
   Neither side would comment further on the latest developments.
   Analysts had predicted the battle would move to the courtroom.
``It was a logical reaction for both sides to what was going on,''
said Berk Boksen, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
   There has been considerable speculation that a third party might
surface, and that remains a possibility, analysts say.
   ``But with both Bass and Macmillan putting short deadlines, it
puts a squeeze on anybody new coming in,'' Thorp said.
   Separately, Macmillan disclosed that ``an entity related to the
Bass Group'' has requested government approval to acquire more than
50 percent of Macmillan's outstanding shares.

<HEAD>Bankers Stress Need For Global Harmony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world economy is ``on a much more solid
footing'' thanks to past efforts among major industrialized nations
to coordinate international policies, U.S. Treasury Secretary James
A. Baker III says.
   Baker told a gathering of bankers and businessmen attending the
34th annual International Monetary Conference, which began Monday
and runs through Wednesday, that inflation remained low and trade
imbalances were narrowing because of global harmony.
   In fact, he said, by working together to stabilize exchange rates
and coordinate economic policies, the major industrialized nations
withstood the worst effects of last October's global stock market
collapse.
   ``It would have been easy for each of us to turn inward and focus
on short-term measures to address immediate domestic needs,'' Baker
said Monday.
   Instead, he said, the nations ``pulled together and intensified
... efforts to find a compatible and reinforcing set of policies to
achieve common goals.
   ``Since that time, strengthened underlying policy actions have
been reflected in enhanced stability of exchange markets,'' he said.
``... The world economy ... is on a much more solid footing.''
   While many conference participants echoed those sentiments
Monday, others called upon corporate America to work more on its own
to sharpen overseas competitiveness.
   ``Of course American industry owes a large part of these
improvements to the weakness of the U.S. dollar. (But) the
supportive strength of the exchange rates can fade as fast as it has
arrived,'' said West German businessmen Dieter Spethmann, chairman
of Thyssen AG in Dusseldorf, in prepared remarks.
   He said U.S. businesses have more going for them than some of
their foreign competitors, including a mobile labor force, flexible
labor costs, favorable energy costs and the largest single market in
the world.
   Yotaro Kobayashi, president of Fuji Xerox Co. Ltd. in Tokyo,
said, ``For survival in this volatile global business environment,
not only American corporations, but businesses around the world are
making significant efforts to expand from their geographic area of
strength into other major markets of the world.''
   The International Monetary Conference seeks to provide leaders of
the top commercial banks and businesses in about 20 different
countries with a chance to confer with government officials on
topics affecting the world economy as a whole, and the international
banking industry in particular.
   Besides Baker, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other
central bankers were among those scheduled to attend closed-door
``think sessions'' and speeches.
   At the opening sessions Monday, the main theme was global
cooperation and competitiveness.
   ``If a deficit country reins in domestic consumption too much, a
recession can result,'' said Walter Seipp, president of the IMC, in
a prepared statement. ``On the other hand, if domestic demand in
surplus countries is stimulated too much, this could then create the
threat of renewed inflation.''
   Michel Camdessus, chairman of the Washington-based International
Monetary Fund, agreed: ``Each of the problems in question is a
matter of common concern, in that each has spillover consequences
for the other.''
   The bankers, though, said politics was among the obstacles
standing in the way of global harmony.
   ``Even when there is agreement on the objectives ... there may
well be difficulties in undoing arduously worked out domestic
compromises, or in obtaining timely domestic action where
policy-making is decentralized,'' Camdessus said.
   Specifically, he called upon the United States to reduce its
large federal budget deficit as a way of keeping interest rates down
and narrowing its trade gap. He also said Europe and Japan should
work toward stimulating their economies.
   In his address Monday, Baker said steps taken beginning in
September 1985 to adjust currency rates were largely responsible for
improved economic conditions today.
   At that time, the United States and its four major trading
partners agreed to devalue the dollar to help reduce the spiraling
U.S. trade deficit and stave off protectionist legislation. Last
year, however, that same group agreed that further declines in the
dollar's value would be ``counterproductive.''
   Baker noted the most recent March trade figures showed
significant improvement, dropping to $9.7 billion _ its lowest level
in three years _ on the strength of record U.S. exports.
   ``The success (of the 1985 gathering) ... created certain
momentum that led to further progress,'' Baker said, pointing to
other, subsequent meetings.

   The signing of a two-year contract
between Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto Workers union has one
union executive wondering how the company will fare in its new era.
   ``The test will really come now as to the (Chrysler Chairman Lee)
Iacocca management's ability to manage,'' UAW Vice President Marc
Stepp said Monday after the contract was signed at a ceremony.
   ``It's been somewhat fortunate with a great deal of assistance,
from workers, suppliers and from the economy,'' he said. ``... Now
they're on their own.''
   Stepp echoed a point made by UAW President Owen Bieber, who said
the signing ceremony never would have been possible without great
sacrifice on the part of all involved with Chrysler over the last
nine years.
   ``I think Chrysler is a good example where cooperation from the
plant floor on up contributed immensely'' to saving the company,
Bieber said.
   Another sign that Chrysler is recovered from the financial
problems that pushed it toward bankruptcy in 1979 is the realignment
of the Chrysler-UAW contract with those at General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co, Stepp said.
   The common expiration date of national labor agreements at the
Big Three gives the union an advantage in picking a company to
target for a pattern agreement. Stepp said Chrysler workers were
hurt financially by being out of synch with GM and Ford, but under
the circumstances, there was no choice.
   ``Many of the benefits the Chrysler workers would have gotten had
to go by the wayside because we had to work to save the company,''
Stepp said.
   ``They are back making profits and they are back on a level
playing field as Lee points out. So they can get back to the
business of competing,'' he said.
   Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John said the two sides
recognize Chrysler's mission.
   ``I think we all realize we're in a very competitive ball game in
the future and that's going to result in good cooperative efforts to
make sure we stay in the ball game,'' he said.
   The agreement covering 66,000 workers took effect May 16 after
being approved by just 54 percent of the covered workers. One unit,
the skilled trades workers, voted down the agreement, but their
objections were dealt with.
   ``I don't think we should dwell on the question of percentage,''
Bieber said. ``It's a question now of what happens from this point
forward.''
   Chrylser and the UAW began early negotiations April 18 as a way
to calm rising tensions brought on by Chrysler's consideration of a
$2 billion offer for its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary
and the company's decision to close a 5,500-worker assembly plant in
Kenosha, Wis.
   The tentative agreement was reached May 4 and eliminated the
possibility of a strike in September, which observers said would
have been likely because of the anger of rank-and-file workers over
the proposed Acustar sale and the Kenosha closing.
   Bieber said the turmoil during negotiations and that 50 percent
of the rank and file failed to vote during the ratification process
contributed to the low percentage of approval.

   post in the next Cabinet if his party wins the September elections.
   ``She's been a great minister, one of the best, but she has made
one mistake and the opposition could not overlook that,'' he said.
``She is resigning today from the government but she has a lot left
to do in politics.'' He appointed Industry Minister Thage G.
Peterson to act as justice minister until the election.
   Mrs. Leijon was forced to quit when the small Communist Party,
which normally supports Carlsson's minority government, decided
Monday it would join the opposition in a no-confidence vote.
   Center Party leader Olof Johannson said: ``She hasn't followed
the rules of the game in our democracy. That's why she had to go.
It's clear that she broke the code of procedure and went beyond the
constitution.''
   She was the third justice minister to resign under a cloud since
the Social Democrats took office in 1982.
   Sten Wickbom quit in October after a convicted spy escaped while
on an unguarded conjugal furlough from prison. In 1983, Ove Rainer
resigned for allegedly taking advantage of tax loopholes.
   Mrs. Leijon was the first justice minister who was not a lawyer
by training, and the first woman to hold the job. She favored
tougher punishments for criminals and took a strong stand against
terrorism.
