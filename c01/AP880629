   The government released 46 political
prisoners including a prominent dissident Thursday as part of
President Roh Tae-woo's efforts to promote democracy, the Justice
Ministry said.
   Among those freed was Kim Keun-tae, who recently was awarded the
Robert F. Kennedy Award for Human Rights. He was sentenced in 1986
to five years imprisonment for inciting unrest. International human
rights groups campaigned for his release.
   The political prisoners were paroled from prisons throughout the
country along with 453 common criminals, the ministry said.
   ``The political offenders were released in line with the
government's continuing efforts to promote democracy in an
atmosphere of national harmony,'' it said in a statement.
   The statement said Kim and 45 other political prisoners were
granted parole because they had repented for what they had done and
promised not to violate the law again.
   Justice Ministry officials indicated the government would free
more political prisoners in the future if they ``are eligible for
parole and show repentance.''
   Despite the government's announcement Wednesday that it would
release the prisoners, opposition leaders charged that many more
dissidents remained behind bars.
   ``How can we talk about reconciliation and political development
while keeping in prison those patriots, numbering more than 600,
who fought for democracy?'' opposition leader Kim Dae-jung told the
National Assembly.
   Kim Dae-jung also urged the government to punish former
President Chun Doo-hwan and his family for alleged corruption and
confiscate their property.
   He demanded the government meet its promise of full democracy
and accused President Roh Tae-woo of failing to carry out some
promised reforms.
   Some opposition groups claim that 1,000 people are behind bars
because of their political beliefs or opposition to the government.
The government contends jailed dissidents committed violent crimes
or broke national seurity laws.
   About 20 relatives of prisoners demonstrated Wednesday outside
the headquarters of the governing Democratic Justice Party to
demand the release of all prisoners. Police arrested and held the
protesters, but later released them.
   Riot police sealed off roads leading to Seoul's Roman Catholic
cathedral Wednesday and stopped dissidents trying to take part in a
march to Chun's home in western Seoul. A handful of people tried to
attend the rally but were blocked by police.
   The Korean news agency, Yonhap, said about 9,000 riot police
were deployed across the capital to stop the march. About 20
students who sneaked past police lines hurled firebombs and rocks
at police from the cathedral compound, but authorities did not
respond.
   ``Punish Chun!'' and ``Drive out Yankees!'' the students
shouted, but passersby ignored the calls or urged protesters not to
use violence.
   Chun, who stepped down in February after a seven-year term, has
been accused of corruption and brutality against dissidents during
his authoritarian administration.
   Justice Ministry officials said Thursday's release left only 81
political offenders in prison on anti-government charges. There
also are about 480 people awaiting trial for political offenses,
they said.
   Included in the release were 11 South Koreans from Japan charged
with spying for North Korea. The 11, who had resided in Japan, were
arrested while visiting Seoul and other parts of the country in the
late 1970s.
   The release coincided with the first anniversary of the ``grand
declaration for democracy'' by President Roh on June 29, 1987. The
declaration accepted most opposition demands for sweeping
democratic reforms.
   Roh's declaration, issued in the midst of nationwide
anti-government demonstrations, paved the way for the country to
adopt a new constitution and hold the first direct presidential
elections in 16 years.
   Roh, running as the government candidate, beat the divided
opposition in the Dec. 16 elections. He then pledged to bring full
democracy to South Korea.

   An explosive device injured seven
youngsters playing with it on a balcony Wednesday, authorities said.
   One child was listed in critical condition with burns and other
injuries and two were reported in serious condition.
   Police Capt. Ed Duncan said the explosive was an M-1000, a
cylindrical device, 2{ inches in diameter, with the force of a
quarter stick of dynamite.
   The blast knocked one of the youngsters off the apartment's
second-floor balcony, Contra Costa County Sheriff's deputies said.
The injured, all boys, ranged in age from 2 or 3 years old to their
teens, authorities said.

   Three members of the Secret Services'
uniformed division at the White House have been placed on
administrative leave and two National Security Council employees
were fired in a cocaine investigation, officials said Wednesday
night.
   The investigation involving drug use by workers at the White
House has been going on for several months and is continuing, said
Robert R. Snow, spokesman for the Secret Service.
   Liz Murphy, a White House spokeswoman, said two NSC clerical
employees ``admitted drug use and were separated from the NSC.''
   ``The president is aware of this investigation,'' she said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, quoted in Thursday's
editions of The Washington Post, said the White House was told
``there were no breaches of security'' found in connection with the
NSC workers.
   ``We are advised at this time that there was no sale or use on
White House grounds,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater and Murphy declined to describe the duties of the two
women who worked at the NSC. ``We cannot provide other details of
the investigation, which is still continuing,'' said Murphy.
   Snow said the Drug Enforcement Administration was brought into
the investigation after there were ``allegations that there was
drug use among some members of the uniformed division.'' He said
information has been turned over to the U.S. attorney for the
District of Columbia, who is considering criminal prosecution.
   ``No arrests have been made,'' Snow said. ``These are only
administrative actions at this point.'' The three have been place
on leave with pay, two of them last Friday and the third on Monday,
he said.
   Snow would not say whether the workers were suspected of using
cocaine at the White House or while on duty.
   ``The U.S. Attorney is reviewing the case and I'm not going to
get into specifics,'' he said.
   Uniformed members of the Secret Service are assigned to guard
the White House grounds, the vice president's home and foreign
embassies. They also travel with the president on trips to provide
security.
   Snow said it was the first time he could recall action being
taken against Secret Service officers over drug abuse allegations.

   A poll on Wednesday put Gov. Michael Dukakis in
a dead heat with Vice President George Bush in the presidential
contest. And a second survey also indicated Dukakis was losing
ground to his Republican rival, but still clinging to a lead.
   A telephone survey of 1,013 adults last week by ABC News and
Money Magazine found 45 percent support for Dukakis and 42 percent
for Bush _ a tie, given the margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
   And a Gallup poll of 1,210 voters suggested Dukakis had the
support of 46 percent, to 41 percent for Bush. The margin of error
was 3 percentage points.
   By contrast, Gallup, NBC News-Wall Street Journal and Washington
Post polls conducted since June 9 have found double-digit leads for
Dukakis. The Post survey, done June 15-19, found a 51-39 percent
Dukakis margin.
   The ABC-Money Magazine poll, conducted June 22-25, found support
for Dukakis down 7 points from an ABC-Post poll in mid-May that
used the same methodology. Bush rose only from 41 to 42 percent
support; those who didn't know grew from 2 percent to 6 percent.
The rest said they wouldn't vote or would support someone else.
   Poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as
Dukakis came off the crest of his Democratic primary victories. A
Harris survey early this month found a dead heat _ 49-44, with a
3-point margin of error _ and a USA Today-CNN poll gave Dukakis a
single-digit lead.
   The ABC-Money Magazine poll had Dukakis leading among women,
respondents earning less than $25,000 a year and adults aged 35 to
54. Bush led among men, respondents earning more than $50,000 and
those in the 55-64 age group.

<HEAD>Baby Bruna Flying Home After Kidnap, Sale And Rescue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 2-year-old Brazilian girl adopted in
Israel after being kidnapped from her parents when she was 4 months
old, left for home Wednesday after the Supreme Court ordered her
returned.
   Two-year-old Bruna, wearing a green dress and a white necklace,
smiled at a crowd of journalists who watched her leave with her
biological parents, Rosilda Goncalves and Luiz Vasconselos of
Curitiba, Brazil.
   The child was adopted by an Israeli couple, Simone and Yaacov
Turgeman, who said they did not know she was kidnapped.
   The Turgemans did not go to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International
Airport, but Turgeman stood on the balcony of his nearby home to
see the plane take off, Israel army radio reported.
   Earlier this month, Israel's Supreme Court ordered Bruna
returned to her biological parents.
   ``It is wonderful to be going home with her. I am the happiest
man alive,'' Vasconselos said as the family stopped over at
London's Heathrow Airport before continuing their trip to Sao
Paulo, Brazil, where a gala reception and parade were prepared for
Bruna's homecoming Thursday.
   ``It is a wonderful day for us. We are so very, very happy and
relieved,'' said Ms. Goncalves.
   Accompanying the family on the flight was Roger Cook, a British
television reporter whose investigative program, ``The Cook
Report,'' uncovered Bruna's story during a probe of the
international business of abducting and selling babies.
   Cook said he felt some sympathy for the adoptive parents, who
paid $25,000 for Bruna and named her Carolyn. They said they did
not know she was an abducted baby and believed the money was needed
to finalize adoption forms.
   According to Israel Television, a serious rift erupted between
the couples over the weekend, prompting the Turgemans to file a
Supreme Court appeal seeking an extension of the deadline. However,
they withdrew the appeal Monday.
   For the first time since the transition period started, Bruna
spent Tuesday night with her biological parents, Israel army radio
said.
   Turgeman said he met with the biological parents on Tuesday ``to
tell them ... not to forget that the child has four parents and not
only two. They are very interested in maintaining a link with us.''
   Cook, whose program is made for Birmingham-based Central
Independent Television, said he and his researchers were told that
over one border point between Brazil and Paraguay alone, some 400
babies a month were being illegally transported for sale.

   Rain, ``blessed rain,'' fell across parched fields of Nebraska
and postponed a hay exposition in Iowa on Wednesday, but
meteorologists said it was no drought-breaker.
   The drought that has for weeks dried most of the nation's
midsection and some of the Southeast has affected more than just
crops. Animals are being forced from the woods to populated areas
in search of food and water.
   Vice President George Bush visited a livestock auction in
Marion, Wis., and Michael Dukakis went to Iowa on Wednesday, as the
head of a non-profit farmers' organization accused politicians and
the news media of taking advantage of the trouble.
   ``We do want to help,'' Bush told about 200 people at the
auction during a recess in bidding. ``I dont want to
over-promise.'' Dukakis, the Democratic nominee-to-be, got a
firsthand look at a relatively healthy corn field but stressed
``the importance of pulling together'' to help farmers.
   The National Weather Service Long Range Predictions Group
released a 30-day forecast Wednesday that called for below-normal
rainfall during July for Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Kentucky and most of California.
   But above-normal rainfall was predicted for some drought-plagued
areas, including Montana, Wyoming, southern South Dakota, Nebraska,
Kansas, New Mexico and western portions of Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma
and Texas.
   ``We went out and sat in it,'' said Wendy Hooyboer, a farmer in
Fort Calhoun, Neb., which got an inch and a half of rain overnight.
``When you're looking at your corn curling, that's what you want to
do. It's a nice, slow, blessed rain.''
   In Waterloo, Iowa, the third annual Farm Progress Hay Expo, a
show of farm equipment and techniques, was postponed a day to
Thursday after three-quarters of an inch of rain fell in the area.
   ``You can't bale the hay when it gets too wet and too heavy. And
it won't keep, it will spoil,'' said Frank Holdmeyer, managing
editor of Wallaces Farmer magazine, sponsor of the event.
   ``I think most everybody is grateful for the rain and aren't too
concerned about the hay expo,'' Holdmeyer said. ``It'd be kind of
nice to have the rain tomorrow, too, even if it means canceling the
expo.''
   ``This isn't a drought-breaker, but the most hopeful development
for rain this month,'' weather service meteorologist John Pollack
said of Nebraska's rainfall, which brought up to 3 inches of rain
to eastern parts of the state.
   While the storms rolled in much-needed moisture to Oklahoma,
forecaster Ken Huckabee said some areas may get no relief at all
because of the hit-or-miss pattern of the weather system.
   ``We had people who lived here in Norman got less than a half
inch of rain, whereas the northern half of Oklahoma City had over 4
inches reported,'' said Huckabee.
   ``We're still facing our hottest month of the year _ July,''
cautioned meterologist Ted Stimach in Madison, Wis., where farmers
who hadn't seen rain for eight weeks rejoiced when more than an
inch of rain fell.
   Animals are feeling drought, too.
   Turtles at a University of Michigan reserve near Pickney are
having trouble nesting in the baked earth.
   ``If we don't get some rain in the next two or three weeks,
we're not going to have any baby turtles this year,'' said Justin
Congdon, who for 14 years has studied the 6,000 painted, snapping
and Blanding's turtles that live on the 1,400-acre Edwin S. George
Reserve.
   Kentucky farmers have found their crops invaded by deer who have
been forced from the woods in search of food and water.
   ``They head for soybeans, which they prefer over corn. But if
soybeans aren't available, they'll settle for corn,'' said John
Phillips, a deer specialist with the Kentucky Division of Wildlife.
``None of them are starving but they are running out of natural
vegetation.''
   Cattlemen in southeast North Dakota have moved their herds to
greener pastures in northwest Minnesota to escape the drought.
   ``I don't know what the weight gains will be, but we're hoping
to keep them alive at least,'' said McLeod rancher Larry Woodbury,
president of the Sheyenne Valley Grazing Association, who said he
had moved more than half of his 240 cattle.
   In other developments:
   _The president of the American Farm Bureau accused the media and
politicians of exaggerating the severity of the drought.
   ``The national media never met a disaster they didn't like, and
they're playing it for all it's worth,'' Dean Kleckner said Tuesday
at a news conference at Colorado State University. Politicians are
hoping to take advantage of the drought crisis in an election year,
he claimed.
   _The Agriculture Department said prices paid to farmers for
grain and other raw products rose 3.7 percent in June as drought
and searing heat reduced 1988 harvest prospects over much of the
nation.
   _Trucks were expected to arrive late Wednesday in Charlotte
Court House, Va., to be loaded with hay to send to drought-stricken
farmers in Akron, Ohio. Charlotte County farmers planned to truck
2,000 bales of hay to farmers who had sent hay to Virginia two
years ago. The trucks were expected to leave Friday and arrive in
Ohio's Mercer County on Saturday.

<TEXT>
   Of the gifts Dublin gave itself for its
1,000th birthday, few have provided as much excitement as the lord
mayor, a woman of great heart who fills the old city with
enthusiasm, charm and grace.
   So successful was Carmencita Hederman in making the Millennium
Year a hit that, although her one-year term ends July 4, an opinion
poll in The Irish Times found 71 percent of Dubliners want her to
have a second.
   Dublin's city elders, the paper said, ``should be encouraged
that such strong views are held about who should be lord mayor; in
most years the majority of citizens couldn't care less.''
   She is a member of the Dublin City Council and its 52 members
choose the mayor, whose duties are largely ceremonial. Mrs.
Hederman, 48, was the first woman to win the office on her own; two
who preceded her were widows of lord mayors.
   The city charter makes no allowance for gender, so she has to be
called lord mayor. Her husband Billy, a surgeon, ``is the first man
to be called lady mayoress,'' says Mrs. Hederman, who trained as a
linguist in Europe and has five children.
   Her married name is a 17th century Anglicizing of an Irish word
meaning ``lightfooted.'' Carmencita acknowledges Spanish ancestry
and her maiden name is Callaghan.
   Mrs. Hederman has been a Dublin councilor for 14 years, always
running as an independent because, she says, ``I like to paddle my
own canoe.''
   She would like a second term, in order ``to see the Millennium
through.'' Her chance appears slim but she has not given up,
declaring to the Irish Times last month: ``All I can say is that if
I do go down, I will go down fighting.''
   The lord mayor has used her entree with the affluent to enlist
commercial sponsors for Millennium events, thus limiting the burden
on taxpayers. Her informal style, whether cycling to an appointment
or chatting with a street crowd, has won the trust of all classes.
   Her impact was felt strongly throughout Ireland in November,
when a bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army killed 12
Protestants at a war memorial service in the Northern Ireland town
of Enniskillen.
   She opened a condolence book that attracted tens of thousands of
signatures. When a Dublin rabbi suggested she take the books to
Enniskillen, she agreed without hesitation.
   ``All these people had come in (to sign), and it was no good
just sort of putting books up on the shelf and saying thanks for
coming,'' she said in an interview. ``We had to do something that
made them feel that their expression of sympathy was reaching its
destination.''
   Irish hearts everywhere were touched by the woman, too choked to
make a speech when she comforted the bereaved of Enniskillen, and
she may have contributed to easing the suspicion Northern Ireland
Protestants have of Roman Catholics in the south.
   Skeptics questioned the wisdom of throwing a year-long birthday
party when the country was in dire economic trouble, and Mrs.
Hederman admits it got off to ``a sluggish start.'' Cynics said
there was no certainty 988 was the year the Vikings founded the
city and suggested it was all a stunt for tourists.
   Mrs. Hederman said her original wish was to delay the
celebration for a year to allow more planning, but added: ``I'm
glad now that we didn't because I think that the Irish are better
at getting things going in a hurry. Our temperament seems to like
the sort of lively rush to boats.''
   So far, the Millennium has given Dublin literary festivals,
regattas, horse races, other sporting events and street theater.
Still to come are fireworks, balloons and a gigantic birthday cake.
   A crash cleanup has scrubbed the grime off such landmarks as the
Post Office, where the 1916 Easter Rising began. A creamy new coat
of paint gleams on the Mansion House, the lord mayor's official
residence.
   ``I think the city and country were at a turning point,'' Mrs.
Hederman said. With record unemployment and tax levels ``we'd
possibly reached an all-time low and the graph was starting to go
up, and so the Millennium has come at a good time.''
   And so, say her fans, has her mayoral term.
   ``In the nicest possible way, she has become the Queen of
Dublin,'' Kevin B. Nowlan, a history professor at University
College, Dublin, said in an interview.
   ``In many ways Irish public life is short of colorful people,
and she combines tremendous intelligence, integrity and great
personal grace.''

<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old boy who had helped
authorities look for his missing playmate for a week finally
admitting killing him accidentally after the body was found in a
crawl space under a house, police said Tuesday.
   The disappearance of 10-year-old Jason Daniel Powell on June 20
had aroused fears of abduction and galvanized this community of
about 10,000 some 20 miles northeast of Dallas. In recent years,
the bodies of several other children have been found long after
they disappeared in the Dallas area.
   Police and hundreds of citizens combed the rural suburb,
focusing on a wooded area two blocks from where the dead boy's
bicycle was found.
   The search ended when Carol Cade found Jason's badly decomposed
body beneath her house Monday, police chief Bruce Beaty said. Jason
died of a single gunshot wound to the head, authorities said.
   ``(Mrs. Cade) had smelled a strong odor Sunday, and Monday she
looked in a small scuttle hole in a bedroom closet and saw Jason's
body,'' Beaty said.
   After the discovery, a boy who was a friend of Jason's told an
investigator he shot Jason with a gun that he did not know was
loaded, Beaty said in a statement.
   Police would not elaborate on the relationship between Mrs. Cade
and the boy who admitted the shooting, but friends said it was her
son. No one came to the door at the Cade home Tuesday evening.
   ``He just panicked. He was scared,'' Sean Powell, 18, said of
the boy who shot his brother. He said the boy admitted shooting
Jason while they were playing in the house.
   ``That's the only explanation I can have for it, but I do
believe him,'' Sean Powell said. ``It must have been hell for a
10-year-old kid to kill his own friend and not even know the gun
was loaded.''
   The shooting took place in Mrs. Cade's living room, said police
investigator James White. The .22-caliber handgun apparently
belonged to Mrs. Cade, police said.
   The boy's body ``had been dragged from the living room into a
bedroom and then placed in a hole under the house,'' White said.
   Jason's bicycle was found in a field some blocks away from the
Cade house. The other boy had told authorities that he last saw his
friend leaving on a bicycle.
   The case will be referred to the Rockwall County district
attorney's office and juvenile authorities, officials said. The boy
was never arrested, and was returned to the custody of his family
Monday night after questioning.
   Gary Watkins, who coached the boy last year in Little League,
said, ``it's just a complete shock. Everyone is just in disbelief.
You just can't imagine a little kid like him doing a thing like
that.''
   ``(He) was always a rambunctious kid but not the kind of kid
you'd ever expect something like this from,'' Watkins said.

   From Christmas trees to canned peas, trouble is brewing.
   From cherries in the trees to honey from the bees, from tomatoes
to potatoes, the suffocating drought in mid-America is taking its
toll on scores of smaller crops that could result in huge losses
for thousands of growers.
   ``It will affect just about everything grown from the Rocky
Mountains east to Ohio ... just about anything you consume that
comes from these parts of the country,'' said Neil Harl, economics
professor at Iowa State University.
   While much of the spotlight about the drought's impact has
focused on the enormous grain and livestock industries, the worst
dry spell since the Dust Bowl also threatens such foods as fruits
and oysters.
   ``When everyone talks about programs, the USDA and the
government, it's always corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton and
peanuts,'' said Harry Foster, secretary-manager of the Red Tart
Cherry Growers in Michigan. ``Everybody else in the world that
grows the 200 other things _ they're sort of forgotten.''
   Michigan cherries used for baking, juices and jams are
suffering, he said, and the trees are beginning to show stress.
Foster said about 150 million pounds of tart cherries will be
harvested in the state in the next six weeks, about 100 million
pounds less than normal.
   All across the Midwest and Southeast, other crops hit by the
drought could shrink supplies, change diets and raise prices at
grocery stores, restaurants and taverns.
   The drought has pushed barley prices higher, raising the
possibility of higher beer costs. One analyst said if the price of
barley goes through the roof, the retail price of beer could
increase by up to 4 percent.
   In Alabama, some farmers are worried they could lose half their
potato crop, much of which is used for chips. In Louisiana, the low
level of the Mississippi River has allowed saltwater to move
upstream, making oysters more susceptible to predators and
imperiling next year's crop, said Mark Chatry, marine laboratory
director at Louisiana's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.
   A dike is being built to block the saltwater flow.
   In north Georgia, some honey production has dried up. In
Wisconsin, the pea crop has shrunk. And across the Midwest,
thousands of Christmas trees planted this spring _ which won't
mature for several years _ have been lost.
   Gene Gress, who runs a Christmas tree farm with his wife in
Polar, Wis., said he lost the 10,000 trees he planted this spring.
Because of the maturation period, though, consumers won't likely
notice until the mid-1990s.
   Other Midwest growers already have talked of losses of 30
percent of this year's planting that could rise to 60 percent
without rain in two weeks, said David Bauman, associate executive
director of the National Christmas Tree Association.
   The arid, sunny days also will cut the number and size of
apples, tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbage, beans and peas.
   Farmer Richard Sorenson, of Oregon, Wis., said because of a
record 40 straight days without moisture, he doesn't expect profits
from 20 acres of peas he planted.
   ``I got 1,250 pounds to the acre, about a fourth of normal,'' he
said. ``When I figured out the costs for seed, fertilizing and
hauling, I owe $312.''
   And that ultimately affects canned goods producers.
   Stokely USA Inc. could be looking at a 25 percent to 30 percent
shortfall of its normal year of 25 million cases of corn, bean,
peas and mixed vegetables, said Stephen Theobald, vice
president-adminstration.
   ``Everything from green beans to tomatoes _ it's all going to be
in short supply,'' he said. ``The quality won't be as good. The
prices will be higher.
   ``It's one of those situations where everybody's the loser _
from the grower to the processor to the consumer.''

<HEAD>Lakers-Pistons Lead Ratings, but Not Enough for CBS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Los Angeles Lakers won with depth and
experience, but NBC prevailed with reruns last week in the A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings.
   The Lakers' 108-105 victory over the Detroit Pistons was a
runaway winner in the Nielsen survey, with a 21.2 average rating.
The next-best program, NBC's ``Night Court,'' was far behind at
17.1.
   However, NBC placed seven reruns in the top 10 to win the weekly
race with an average rating of 12.1. CBS, also benefiting from a
third-place finish for a first-run ``60 Minutes,'' was second at
11.3. ABC lagged at 8.8.
   For the 40 weeks of the season, NBC's average is 15.4, followed
by CBS with 13.0 and ABC with 12.9.
   A rating point equals 886,000 homes with television.
   The rest of the week's top 10 included a Perry Mason movie,
``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' on NBC, ``Murder She Wrote'' on
CBS and ``Different World,'' ``Silent Witness'' and ``Golden
Girls'' on NBC.
   ABC's highest-rated show was ``Head of the Class,'' tied with
NBC's ``Amen'' in 16th place.
   The rating for Tuesday night's seventh game of the
Lakers-Pistons series beat the previous mark of 19.3 for the final
game of the 1984 series between the Lakers and the Boston Celtics,
said Michael Eisenberg, director of research at CBS.
   The seven-game series this year, however, averaged half a point
lower than the 15.9 average for the Celtics-Lakers series in 1987,
Eisenberg said.
   CBS had the top-rated news program for the week with an average
rating of 9.2. NBC had 8.2 and ABC 8.1. ABC led the second-quarter
ratings, however, with an average of 9.5, followed by CBS at 9.3
and NBC at 8.5.

   When she looks out her window, Lynn
Johansen sees a little boy who reminds her of the teen-age brother
she lost during a Navy water training exercise.
   The boy is Mrs. Johansen's 6-year-old son Bradley, a look-alike
for his uncle Lee Mirecki, the 19-year-old recruit who died in
March at the Navy rescue swimmer school in Pensacola, Fla.
   Now, nearly four months later, four instructors are facing
non-judicial hearings in the case. But Mirecki's family and a close
friend said Monday they still wonder why the bright young recruit
died.
   ``I don't think anybody really knows what happened,'' said Mrs.
Johansen, 30. She said she came away from the military hearing
earlier this month ``a little more bewildered in trying to separate
true fact from speculation.''
   Mirecki was described at the investigative hearing as being
literally scared to death when he was allegedly forced into the
pool after he tried to quit. Testimony indicated he was held under
water after he had escaped once from the pool and clung to the side
but was dragged back during an exercise known as ``sharks and
daisies.'' It was intended to train swimmers how to break the
strangle hold of someone they were trying to rescue.
   The four instructors accepted the Navy prosecutor's offer for
the non-judicial hearings on whether they should be punished with
pay or rank cuts or other non-judicial action. A court-martial has
been recommended for a fifth instructor.
   The officer who was in charge of the school rejected an offer
for a non-judicial hearing. His case will be re-evaluated to decide
whether to drop a charge of dereliction of duty or recommend
court-martial.
   ``I did find a lot of things out, but I guess the question that
will always be in my mind is why didn't they let him DOR,'' or drop
on request from the program, said Mirecki's mother, Elaine Kitowski
of Manitowish Waters. It was through the persistence of the family
that an investigation into the recruit's death was finally launched.
   Mrs. Kitowski said she misses most the jokes and humor of her
youngest of four children. Lee often taped her scissors together or
hid her keys.
   ``He was a go-getter, a very active boy,'' said Mrs. Kitowski.
   An active soccer and baseball player, Mirecki moved to Appleton
to live with Mrs. Johansen and her family for two years to be
closer to a high school with more sports activities.
   Mrs. Johansen, who has collected boxes of information about her
brother's death, said the family never sought to blame any
individual. But she said they wanted to know what had happened.
   ``If he did die what looks to be a horrible, terrifying death
that could have been prevented, I'll hopefully find out enough to
prevent it from ever happening again,'' she said.
   Those who knew him described Mirecki as a determined young man
who was used to winning and was no quitter.
   ``He hated to lose, but he didn't lose very often,'' said Laurie
Radewan, 28, of Racine, Mirecki's other sister. ``Whether you were
outside playing football or in the house playing Monopoly, he'd
cream you.''
   He told his close friend James Woller that he wanted to become a
psychologist someday. But he joined the Navy after graduating from
Appleton High School-West because he also wanted to fly and thought
the military could help him get the money he needed to attend
college.
   He grew up near the water, boating, swimming and fishing.
   ``Lee was not afraid of the water,'' said Larry Johansen,
Mirecki's brother-in-law.
   But Lee hated being dunked or dragged under water, a fear
stemming from a dunking incident by older boys when he was 5. His
father rescued the crying, coughing youngster, Mrs. Johansen said.
   ``He never mentioned it, but we all knew ... you don't dunk Lee
because he would get real angry,'' she said.
   Years later, he told his family he was having difficulty with
the Navy rescue swimmer school.
   Mrs. Radewan said she never realized the extent of her brother's
fear and does not think he did either.
   ``He grew up on a lake. He enjoyed the water but he didn't like
people jumping on him,'' she said. ``He just didn't like to feel
threatened in the water.''

<HEAD>Niger Tries Family Planning To Ease Strains On Resources</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>BY ROBERT WELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NIAMEY, Niger (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unable to turn back the advancing Sahara
Desert or stop periodic droughts, Niger has turned to family
planning to control population growth and reduce pressure on its
fragile resources.
   The north-central African nation has only 6.8 million people in
an area twice the size of France, but it can't feed itself and at
its current growth rate the population will double in 23 years.
   Three and a half years ago the government strongly endorsed
family planning, an unprecedented move in this largely Moslem area
of Africa just below the Sahara, and in April it legalized
contraception.
   ``The legalization of contraception is concrete proof of the
government's support for family planning,'' said Dr. Halima
Maidouka Diallo, director of family planning in the Ministry of
Health.
   To counter African traditions in favor of large families and
avoid potential clashes with some interpretations of the Koran, the
Moslems' holy book, the government presented family planning as a
necessary move to reduce infant and maternal mortality.
   Niger's infant mortality rate of 135 deaths per 1,000 births and
maternal mortality rate of 7 deaths per 1,000 births are among the
highest in the world.
   ``For a woman to be valued here, she must have many children as
soon as possible. Children help with work and are considered life
insurance,'' Maidouka said.
   ``Women are considered wicked if they do not produce children,''
she added.
   Customarily, if a woman doesn't bear children, a husband will
look for another wife.
   Because many infants die, mothers bear many children. It is not
unusual for a mother to have 15 children with only five surviving.
   The frequent births become both a cause and effect. Women become
pregnant again as soon as possible after delivery, without time to
fully recover, and often give birth prematurely to infants who have
little chance of surviving.
   It also creates problems in schools, where many young girls
become pregnant. The average age for marriage for women is about
15{.
   Some women seek abortions clandestinely, as they are not legal
here, or go to neighboring countries.
   ``At least once a month there is a case of a baby being
strangled and tossed in a trash can,'' Maidouka said.
   She added that suicides are also a problem among women with
unwanted pregnancies.
   The family planning program seeks to offer women an alternative.
   ``A child if I want, when I want,'' says a poster displayed
throughout the country's main family planning center.
   The center, built with funding from the United Nations, has a
large poster explaining various contraception methods. The
explanations are accompanied by explicit diagrams showing, among
other things, how to use a condom.
   The diagrams are necessary in a nation where only 4.4 percent of
the women are literate and only 20 percent of children go to
primary schools.
   Dr. Voahangi Ravao of Malagasy, a staff associate of the
Columbia University Center for Population and Family Health, says
the most common reason given in a Niamey survey of women who did
not use family planning was ``nobody told me.''
   Opposition by husbands was cited by only 5 percent, she said.
   She added that she has seen women who've walked 10 miles to pick
up birth control pills.
   She said a survey taken a year ago showed 6 to 10 percent of the
women were using some form of modern contraception, which is a very
high rate for the Sahel, the region just below the Sahara.
   In the West African nation of Burkina Faso, for example, a
similar survey found 4 to 6 percent of women using modern birth
control methods.
   Maidouka said radio and television broadcasts, in the main
national languages, will be used to reach as many people as
possible.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development has approved an
$11-million, five-year grant, to support the project.
   In a report, the agency said Niger's ``rapid population growth
has accentuated the processes of deforestation and
desertification.''
   It added, ``Wood harvesting, which provides 80 percent of the
nation's energy, far exceeds the sustainable capacity of the
forests. The forested area has decreased by 30 percent over the
last 20 years due to pressure from farmers, herders, firewood
cutters and drought.''
   Only 12 percent of the country is arable, and only 3 percent can
be used for growing crops. The annual per capita income is $240.
   The U.S. agency's report concedes that even if couples were
limited immediately to two children per family the population would
continue to grow for 40 years because almost half the current
population are teen-agers. And the agency says it is likely to take
30 years to reach the goal of only two children per family.
   The family-planning project, however, doesn't even talk of
limiting families to two children.
   It focuses on how planning and spacing of pregnancies will mean
better health for mother and child.
   ``There is much to do,'' Maidouka said. ``Tradition is a
problem. Perhaps our children will have full rights. Now the man is
the boss.''

   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg has become a
mother, and she and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, have named
their daughter after the 97-year-old Kennedy-clan matriarch, Rose
Kennedy.
   Rose Kennedy Schlossberg was born at 3:30 a.m. Saturday at the
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, and weighed in at 7
pounds, 12 ounces, said Nancy Tuckerman, a family spokeswoman.
   Mother and baby are doing fine, Ms. Tuckerman said Tuesday. It's
the first grandchild for Ms. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis.
   Earlier this year, Ms. Kennedy, the 30-year-old daughter of the
late President Kennedy and granddaughter of Rose Kennedy, graduated
from the Columbia University School of Law.

   David Letterman went back on the air without his
writers, but didn't leave any doubts about his sympathies regarding
the 4-month-old scriptwriters' strike, and grabbed a few laughs.
   The host of NBC-TV's ``Late Night With David Letterman'' blamed
the strike on producers, whom he repeatedly called ``money-grubbing
scum'' and ``jerks.''
   ``I certainly have a bright future, don't I?'' he asked his
audience, which responded with laughter.
   Normally, the show has 13 writers, including Letterman. After
months of reruns, the show resumed Tuesday with only Letterman, who
wrote his own material, said Peter Spivey, a spokesman for NBC.
   Last week, members of the Writers Guild of America voted to
continue their strike by a 75-25 percent margin.

   Actor Stacy Keach says he enjoyed going to
seven foreign countries to film his television miniseries portrayal
of Ernest Hemingway, but the best thing about it was that the
writer's son liked his performance.
   Keach said he read a tremendous amount of material, including
letters, biographies and fiction, to prepare for the title role in
``Hemingway,'' which is currently in syndication.
   ``I had to carry a footlocker around with me from country to
country,'' Keach said recently.
   ``For me, the most gratifying experience with the result of
`Hemingway' was Jack Hemingway's comment that he liked it.''
   Jack Hemingway, the son of the writer, is also the father of
actresses Mariel and Margaux Hemingway.

bicycle messenger who tried to enter the Justice Department wearing
a ``Meese is a Pig'' T-shirt didn't bother him a bit.
   ``I have no interest, by the way, in any company that

Tuesday.
   The messenger, Christopher Stalvey, was barred at the door when
he made the attempt recently, but Meese recalled, ``As soon as the

   The attorney general has been the target of an investigation
into whether he lobbied for a defense contractor, but has not been

not being able to appear before the heir to the British throne and
14,500 other people.
   Miss Bumbry sang on the opening night Sunday but couldn't

   The Mike Tyson-Michael Spinks title
fight may have been short, but casinos are still counting their
winnings, and one owner even publicly thanked a competitor: Donald
Trump, who put on the bout.
   Trump's casino reaped the big bucks, but others collected
healthy profits by simply buying a section of seats for their own
high rollers and by selling their rooms to overflow crowds.
   In fact, the impact of Monday's fight, which Tyson won in 91
seconds with a knockout, was enough to prompt Del Webb's Claridge
Casino Hotel to splurge on a full-page advertisement in The
(Atlantic City) Press that ran the day after the extravaganza.
   ``We may be the smallest house in town _ but we're big enough to
know that when someone has the guts and vision to do something that
benefits all of us, recognition is in order,'' the ad read. ``So
thanks, Mr. Trump.''

<HEAD>Meese Withdraws From Pentagon Bribery Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III spoke at
length at a news conference about the Pentagon bribery
investigation, but never mentioned that he had removed himself from
decisions in the case a day earlier because his own lawyers
represent clients in the probe.
   The burgeoning Defense Department contract fraud investigation
was the dominant topic at Meese's news conference Tuesday
afternoon, generating nine questions. Meese told reporters that
earlier Tuesday he had briefed Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci,
who is trying to determine whether to take administrative action
against any contractors or Pentagon employees.
   At the same news conference, Meese volunteered that he was
recused from a Justice Department civil suit against the Teamsters
union, because they were the main union that endorsed President
Reagan in 1980 and Meese was a top campaign official.
   But he said not a word about stepping aside in the Pentagon
probe.
   In response to questions Tuesday night from The Associated
Press, Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said Meese's
recusal was relayed to top top Justice officials in a memo sent
Monday by Edward Dennis, acting assistant attorney general in
charge of the criminal division.
   Korten said Meese did not mention his recusal at the news
conference because ``there wasn't any particular reason to mention
it.''
   Korten said the attorney general's law firm, Miller, Cassidy,
Larroca & Lewin, ``keeps him informed of what clients they have
that may have business pending before the department and in those
cases, Meese recuses himself to be safe.''
   ``Miller, Cassidy has two clients with some connection with the
defense investigation,'' Korten said. He said he did not know who
the clients were.
   The law firm represents Meese in the year-old investigation by
independent counsel James McKay into whether Meese used public
office to favor friends or companies which may have, in turn,
rewarded him or his family.
   Meese has denied any wrongdoing. McKay, whose report should be
released in two weeks, is not expected to seek any indictment of
Meese, though McKay is expected to refer several matters to Justice
ethics officials to see if administrative discipline is warranted.
   James Rocap, one of Meese's attorneys, declined to say whether
the firm had any clients in the defense case but did say it had a
routine arrangement to get Meese recused quickly from any cases
involving its other clients.
   Although some Democrats in Congress have said Meese's legal
troubles, including his extensive recusals, hamper his ability to
run the Justice Department, Korten said, ``As a practical matter,
he very rarely gets involved in the specific details of any case,
so it has little practical effect.''
   In many law firms and in the Justice Department in the past,
recusal from a case barred the affected lawyer not only from making
decisions but also from receiving briefings, for fear he might
subtly influence decisions.
   Asked if Meese would continue to get Pentagon case briefings,
Korten said, ``I'll have to check with him on that. Recusal just
means he doesn't make decisions.''
   Korten said Meese answered the new conference questions ``on the
basis of what (chief prosecutor) Henry Hudson and Ed Dennis have
indicated about the way they intend to proceed, in briefings he had
before he was recused.''
   At the news conference, Meese was asked when more information
would be made public. He replied, ``From this stage on, I expect a
lot less information coming out rather than more until such time as
the grand jury investigation is complete.''
   He added ``it may take longer than'' the 30 to 90 days he had
earlier predicted for the first indictments to be returned.
   Asked if former Reagan administration Defense Secretary, Caspar
Weinberger, had been lax in policing contract fraud, Meese replied,
``Certainly nothing that I know about nor have I seen anything in
what I know about the case so far that would indicate that there
was any laxity or lapse on the part of Mr. Weinberger.''
   Meese has been criticized privately by some Justice officials
for applying recusals narrowly. They object to his continued
participation in the case of convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard
while Miller, Cassidy represents Col. Avi Sella, an Israeli officer
who is charged with recruiting Pollard to spy but who has never
returned to this country for trial.
   Justice spokesmen say Meese participates in aspects of the
Pollard case that do not involve Sella.

<HEAD>Appeals Judges Reverse Goetz's Sentence; Order Resentencing</HEAD>

   An appeals court threw out subway gunman
Bernhard Goetz's six-month jail sentence Tuesday and ordered him
resentenced for criminal possession of a gun in the shooting of
four teen-agers 3{ years ago.
   The state Supreme Court's Appellate Division voted 5-0 to vacate
the jail sentence Justice Stephen Crane imposed on Goetz last
October for third-degree criminal possession of a weapon.
   The appeals court let stand the $5,000 fine, the 280 hours of
community service, the five years' probation and the psychiatric
counseling that Crane ordered for Goetz.
   Goetz, a 40-year-old electronics specialist, was acquitted last
June 16 of all but the gun charge in the shooting of four
teen-agers in a subway in Lower Manhattan on Dec. 22, 1984. He said
he shot them after they tried to rob him. The young men claimed
they were just panhandling money.
   Goetz did not return telephone calls.
   One of Goetz's lawyers, Mark Baker, said he was ``partly
pleased'' by the decision. He said he was happy that the court
found the sentence illegal but he said he planned to appeal other
issues in the case to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest
tribunal.
   Both the prosecution and the defense contended that the
punishment was illegal and that Goetz should have been sentenced to
a year in jail.
   The defense wanted a year's sentence because that would have
made Goetz eligible for release after two months. Because of a
quirk in the law, a six-month sentence would have meant he was not
eligible for parole until four months had been served.
   The prosecution also argued that the law mandated a minimum
sentence of one year.
   In their opinion, the judges wrote that Crane could have imposed
a shorter legal sentence if he had explained why the sentence
required by law ``would be unduly harsh.''
   ``Since the court expressly stated on the record that a definite
one-year term or an indeterminate term would not be unduly harsh,
the split sentence was unauthorized and illegal,'' the judges said
in an unsigned three-page opinion.

   The Roman Catholic Church is taking a new and
more vocal role in providing political guidance to its faithful,
ignoring legal restrictions that date back to early this century.
   In pastoral letters and statements to the news media, bishops
and priests have begun to attack government corruption and demand
clean and honest elections.
   Other letters openly urge Mexicans to ``reason through'' their
votes in July 6 national elections and not to feel themselves tied
to a political party.
   ``The violation, by means of fraud or repression, of the right
to to vote is more serious and harmful than any economic fraud,''
the bishops of the northern city of Monterrey recently said in a
letter urging Catholics to participate more actively in politics.
   Similar pastoral letters, especially in northern Mexico, have
been issued by other bishops.
   No names need be mentioned.
   Since the early 20th century, Mexico has been ruled only by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and the
government does not like the Church's new voice because it feels
itself the target.
   According to the Mexican constitution, written in 1917 after 10
years of revolutionary upheaval, the Church does not legally exist,
cannot own any property and priests cannot vote.
   To this day, comments by priests with a hint of political
overtones are criticized by politicians as violations of the
constitution.
   ``We became more a silent than a silenced church,'' said
Monsignor Genaro Alamilla, spokesman for the Mexican Conference of
Catholic Bishops.
   But the church lately has begun realizing it has a lot of power
in the world of Mexican contradictions, where government leaders
are officially atheistic but send their children to Catholic
schools, marry in the church and maintain a chapel in the
presidential residence.
   Outgoing President Miguel de la Madrid is himself a product of
Catholic schools and his children attend them.
   And, like other presidents before him, he meets occasionally,
albeit privately, with Mexican bishops to discuss national problems.
   During his presidential campaign, PRI candidate Carlos Salinas
de Gortari has made it a point to visit bishops in the provinces
and discuss the country's problems with them in meetings that are
not publicized but leaked to the press.
   ``He tried to gain some sort of support from the only real moral
force in this country _ the Catholic church,'' said Antonio Alberto
Loyola, a Catholic lay leader and professor who is also a press
officer for the conservative National Action Party, the country's
second largest party.
   Loyola and other Catholics believe the church is beginning to
flex its muscle by pressuring the political system to become more
open and democratic.
   ``The church in Mexico is beginning to awaken,'' said Manuel
Gomez, director of the Mexican Institute of Social Christian
Doctrine, a 5-year-old, privately funded organization. ``Its new
leaders have better contact with the laity, there is a new
awareness in defense of human rights, of the dignity of the
person.''
   A few months ago, the Bishops Conference issued a pastoral
letter that said: ``Elections are a challenge to us all to
eliminate from our social life the vices of corruption, hiding of
the truth, selfishness and all sorts of violence, oppression and
threats.''
   But despite its increased interest in politics, the Church has
been at pains not to take sides in electoral campaigns, arguing
that it is merely trying to do its duty in providing guidance to
the fold.
   ``The church makes the Catholic aware of his human dignity and
its civic duties and, based on that, he then votes,'' Monsignor
Alamilla said. ``From the government he must demand respect for
human rights, democratic principles, the common good, and honest
elections.''
   ``In Mexico now there is general dissatisfaction and mistrust.
There is a crisis that demands that the citizens get involved
actively in politics.''
   The church claims 90 per cent of all Mexicans are Catholics.

<TEXT>
   Every sweltering
day, folks carrying buckets, thermoses and jugs turn on the outside
tap at the EZ Stop convenience store and fill up.
   To Leone Johnson, providing drinking water to her customers and
neighbors is no big deal. To many living on the Fort Berthold
reservation, Indian and non-Indian, it is a gesture of friendship
deeply appreciated.
   Mrs. Johnson's store gets city water that's been filtered and
chlorinated. Many of the nearby wells, the only reliable source of
water for thousands in northwestern North Dakota, yield brown water
full of salt and foul-tasting minerals.
   ``Chemically, the well water tests safe to drink, but it tastes
almost as bad as it looks,'' said Rich Schilf, natural resources
director of the Three Affiliated Tribes.
   Holding up a jug containing water the color of crude oil, Schilf
said, ``One of my co-workers brought this in from his house this
morning and dared me to drink it. I decided to pass.
   ``Most of the groundwater on the reservation is terrible, full
of sodium,'' added Schilf, who's tried for years to get a
long-promised, federally funded water system installed on the
reservation. ``Almost everybody hauls their drinking water if
they're not hooked up to the New Town system.''
   New Town, the reservation's population center, with 1,300
residents, has doubled its pumping since drought settled on this
high, parched prairie two months ago.
   ``We're pumping 600,000 gallons a day to try and meet the
demand,'' said Bill Folven at the treatment plant. Despite New
Town's being within sight of a huge Missouri River reservoir, the
town gets its drinking water from three deep wells.
   The water plant sells the precious commodity by the
quarter-dollar.
   ``You get 100 gallons for each quarter,'' said Folven, who
empties the coin box and says these days it's usually full.
   Many people on the reservation carry big tanks on their pickup
trucks. They drive to the plant, park under a pipe jutting from the
concrete block building, put quarters in the meter, press a button
and stand back as the water runs.
   Elmer Rambel has run a commercial water delivery service around
New Town for years.
   ``Usually Elmer gets his water from a spring, but his filtration
system broke so he's buying it from the city and hauling it to
us,'' said Myrna Jacobs, a mother of five who deals in real estate
with the Three Affiliated Tribes.
   ``Usually I pay $25 for 2,200 gallons to be delivered to our
cistern, but two weeks ago Elmer had to raise his price to $31,''
she said. ``Despite trying to be real careful and conserve water, I
had to have two truckloads of water delivered to the house last
month and I'm sure it will be the same for June.''
   Mrs. Johnson says she gives her water away in small quantities
``because I've lived here all my life and the people who need my
water to drink are neighbors and friends and customers whose
business I appreciate.''
   She says it doesn't matter how much higher her water bill will
run.
   ``It's something I can do that helps,'' she said.

<HEAD>Central America Decisions to Await Completion of Shultz Trip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's spokesman concedes that
efforts to pry concessions from Nicaragua's Sandinista government
have stalled, and the administration's next step won't be decided
until Secretary of State George Shultz returns from Central America.
   Amid increasing reports that Contra rebel troops are returning
to base camps, and with no new peace talks scheduled, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked Tuesday whether Reagan had
decided to submit a new aid package to Congress.
   ``We will not have any judgment on the package until sometime
after'' Shultz returns from the region on Friday, Fitzwater said,
``and we don't have a specific schedule, even on that.''
   Shultz was leaving today on a trip that will take him to Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
   Shultz told congressional leaders on Tuesday that his trip has
the primary purpose of ``shoring up'' the four democracies in the
region by demonstrating long-term U.S. support, according to
participants in the meeting.
   Republican congressional leaders met with Reagan, but House GOP
Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said the president gave no hint of
his plans. He said the issue of another Contra aid package did not
come up.
   ``I'm sure that the administration's position will not be
formulated until after Secretary Shultz makes his trip to Central
America and comes back again with some answers,'' Michel said.
   Asked to assess the status of Reagan administration efforts to
force changes in Nicaragua, Michel replied, ``Well, it's
stalemated, there's no question about that.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged that the
administration's efforts have been thrown off stride.
   ``The administration and the president are certainly concerned
that we've not made any progress in the peace talks,'' he said.
``The question before us is where to go. I suppose stalemated is a
good word in that sense.''
   Ambassador Max Kampelman, whom Reagan reassigned briefly from
U.S.-Soviet arms talks to provide fresh diplomatic impetus to the
Central America policy, joined Shultz in briefing House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, and other members of Congress on Tuesday morning.
   Asked what Kampelman learned from the leaders of other Central
American nations about any new U.S. military moves, Michel said,
``they would not like to see a resumption of the war or military
hostilities, but they thought probably economic reprisals or
pressure'' were needed to bring about democratic reforms in
Nicaragua.
   But, he added, ``then you get into real trouble'' if sanctions
hurt the common people without forcing governmental changes.
   Contra leaders abandoned the peace talks in Managua, which had
been called for under the Central American peace plan.
   A cease-fire has been extended until June 30, but the Contras
have said they do not want to return to any negotiations in
Managua, saying they felt intimidated by the Sandinistas there.
Rebel leaders said the Sandinistas virtually demanded that the
resistance lay down its arms, without any guarantees for democratic
reform.
   Michel said that in the Capitol Hill meeting, Wright ``did
respond that, at some time down the road here, he would honor a
request of the president for whatever move we might want to make.''
   But, he said, ``If I were asked a question, you know, is it
possible to get a military package through the House right now, I
would have to be very negative on that at the moment.''
   Wright, describing the Shultz meeting, said the secretary ``says
what he really wants to do is to shore up and reinforce our
commitment to the success of the four democratic countries in the
region.''
   The speaker called the discussion a sign of a ``shift in
emphasis'' by the administration.

<HEAD>Meese Uses FBI Plane 40 Times, Won't Say Why</HEAD>

   Congressional investigators have learned that
Attorney General Edwin Meese III is a frequent flier on FBI
executive aircraft, but the bureau won't say where he goes or what
he does.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., who is directing an inquiry into
Meese's use of FBI aircraft, says the secrecy raises concern that
the administration may be trying ``to keep embarrassing information
from public view.''
   English also says that from what he's learned so far, it appears
at least some of Meese's travel may have violated President
Reagan's mandate to fly on commercial airlines when it is cheaper
for taxpayers.
   At English's request, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative wing of Congress, asked the FBI to supply flight logs
showing where its aircraft had flown and who had been aboard.
   The request was part of a larger review by the English-chaired
Government Operations subcommittee on government information,
justice and agriculture to determine whether the VIP aircraft owned
by various federal agencies could be put to better use in the war
on drugs.
   Instead of the FBI aircraft logs, GAO was given a summary that
provided details about aircraft use by FBI and other Justice
Department officials but only dates and the notation ``USAG'' for
Meese.
   The entire document was stamped ``classified,'' keeping it from
public view.
   The report showed that between June 3, 1986, and May 11, 1987,
Meese used an FBI aircraft 40 times, compared to 37 trips for all
other FBI and Justice officials, according to a committee staffer
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   During this same period, FBI Director William Webster used the
aircraft only six times, one of them a joint trip with Meese,
according to the staffer.
   Patrick Korten, Meese's spokesman, said there were no
improprieties in the attorney general's travels but he would not
comment on why details of the trips are being withheld from
Congress and the public. FBI spokeswoman Sue Schnitzer said the
bureau had no comment.
   English, who has asked the GAO to make another attempt to get
details of Meese's travels, said he has ``serious doubts'' that
classifying all information about the aircraft's use meets the test
of protecting U.S. national defense or foreign policy interests.
   ``The questionable use of the classification system to protect
information relating to the attorney general raises a concern that
classification is being used to keep embarrassing information from
public view,'' he said.
   The committee staffer said the FBI is refusing even to reveal
the aircraft's make and model. However, a separate committee source
said documents indicated that most, if not all, of the trips were
made on the bureau's Sabreliner, a twin-engine executive jet made
by Rockwell.
   The use of such government aircraft is governed by Circular
A-126, an Oct. 5, 1983, White House policy statement that prohibits
use of VIP airplanes when cheaper commercial transportation is
available.
   The circular requires that when an agency uses one of its
aircraft to carry passengers, it must file a written justification
showing that the cost does not exceed the price of flying
commercial.
   English said that ``it is not at all clear that the attorney
general's use of the aircraft conforms to federal regulations. ...
It appears likely that some of the attorney general's travel
utilizing the FBI aircraft could have been accomplished more
economically on commercial airlines.
   ``It does not appear that the Department of Justice has complied
with Circular A-126 in regards to the use of the FBI aircraft by
the attorney general,'' he said.
   Korten said that ``Mr. Edwards is wrong when he suggests that
the attorney general may have violated applicable orders. Whenever
Mr. Meese travels, it is for reasons that comply with the
applicable order.''
   Asked about Meese using the aircraft more than the FBI, Korten
said, ``I don't have anything on that.''

   U.S. relations with Mexico are never
harmonious even in the best of times and a recent episode involving
Mexico's handling of a Puerto Rican separatist wanted by the United
States is bound to deepen mutual distrust.
   Mexico ignored a U.S. request for the extradition of William
Morales, 37, and instead granted him early release last Friday from
an eight-year prison term. He was then deported to Cuba.
   Mexico views Morales as a man who was persecuted in the United
States for his political views. The United States sees him as a
terrorist and says he was involved in more than 50 bombings in the
U.S. that resulted in widespread death and injury.
   Morales had been sentenced to more than 100 years in prison but
escaped from U.S. custody in 1979. He fled to Mexico where, four
years later, he was convicted in the killing of a police officer.
   Despite strong U.S. interest in the case, Mexico did not
formally notify American officials of Morales' release and
deportation until five days after his arrival in Havana, safely
beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.
   The U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Charles Pilliod, has been
recalled to Washington for consultations but it seems unlikely the
administration will take significant retaliatory action against
Mexico.
   The main argument against economic sanctions is that they harm
the United States as much as Mexico by increasing the flow of
undocumented aliens. The administration's options appear to be
limited.
   A key role in the Morales case apparently was played by Foreign
Secretary Bernardo Sepulveda. It was he who formally rejected the
U.S. extradition request, overriding a ruling last December by a
Mexico City judge.
   Sepulveda ranks as perhaps the State Department's most disliked
foreign minister. One official said Sepulveda and Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams have a ``shoot on sight''
relationship.
   Sepulveda is not a favorite of Secretary of State George P.
Shultz either. At one point several years ago, Shultz's aides
considered contriving an excuse for Shultz to back out of a
scheduled meeting with Sepulveda to spare him what promised to be
an unpleasant encounter. But Shultz went ahead with the meeting
anyway.
   Much of the U.S.-Mexican hostility is based on Mexico's support
for Nicaragua's leftist government and, to a lesser extent, the
rebel movement in El Salvador. Mexico and Cuba, and more recently
Panama, are Nicaragua's strongest supporters in the hemisphere.
   Sepulveda is described here as an advocate of selling oil to
Nicaragua at concessional rates even though Nicaragua has a
reputation as a poor credit risk.
   This has put Sepulveda at odds with Mexican ministries
responsible for economic matters. American officials say that on
two occasions, vessels carrying Mexican oil to Nicaragua were
called home before reaching their destination. On both occasions,
Sepulveda was overruled by President Miguel de la Madrid's
financial advisers.
   Sepulveda has maintained that the United States made a big
mistake by supporting an armed insurrection against the Sandinista
government. He has said cooperation with Nicaragua would make it
more likely to pursue moderate policies. He views with disdain
President Reagan's assertion that failure to oppose the Sandinistas
eventually could raise the prospect of a leftist uprising in Mexico
itself.
   Despite the lack of trust, the administration was caught by
surprise when Mexico released Morales and allowed him to go to
Cuba. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the decision an
``inexplicable affront.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Morales' violent
criminal past was so self-evident that his release and deportation
``could only have been taken for political reasons.''
   The two countries can only hope that a change in administration
in both will lead to a more harmonious relationship. Mexico will
elect a new president next month and the United States will do the
same in November. New teams _ and perhaps new approaches _ will be
in place by early next year.

   Kuwait's ambassador to the United States says
40 sophisticated F-A-18 fighter-bombers his country plans to
purchase would be ``worthless'' if Congress refuses to include
air-to-ground missiles in the sale.
   ``This weapon is not a luxury, it is a necessity,'' ambassador
Saud N. Al-Sabah said in an interview. ``It's like buying a car
without all the equipment that goes with it.''
   Congress is reviewing the administration plan to sell $1.9
billion worth of F-A-18s and armaments to Kuwait, which says it
needs the equipment to defend against attacks by participants in
the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   Three U.S. allies have been authorized to buy F-A-18s, the
Navy's newest and fastest combination interceptor-bomber, but
Kuwait would be the first Arab nation to receive them.
   The height of Capitol Hill concern about the sale is not the
planes, but the 300 Maverick antitank and antiship missiles that
would be mounted on the aircraft.
   The 20 senators and more than 50 congressmen who signed a letter
expressing reservations about the sale say they are worried about
the escalation of sophisticated weaponry in the region, notably
among countries potentially hostile to Israel.
   Al-Sabah said he believes the sale will go through, but added:
``You cannot have an airplane flying without munitions. Unless
there is sufficient ammunition to support this high-tech equipment,
you would be buying something that in the end would be worthless.
   ``We're not buying the aircraft to fly around in our leisure,''
he said. ``You could buy a much cheaper aircraft for that purpose.''
   The defense relationship between the United States and Kuwait
has grown in recent months with the ``reflagging'' of Kuwaiti
vessels to put them under the umbrella of U.S. naval protection.
   In a visit designed to highlight the extent of the relationship,
Kuwait's crown prince and prime minister, Shaikh Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Salem Al-Sabah will come to the United States in early July.
   It will be the first state visit by a Kuwaiti leader since
November 1968 and will include meetings with President Reagan, Vice
President George Bush, congressional leaders and members of the
U.S. foreign policy establishment.
   When Kuwait's emir came 20 years ago, he met President Lyndon
Johnson and President-elect Richard M. Nixon. There are no plans
for Shaikh Saad to meet the expected Democratic presidential
nominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, but the ambassador
said a get-together could be arranged if Dukakis is interested.
   ``We have been on the front pages for the past 18 months or two
years now,'' the ambassador said. ``I think the U.S. people have
the right to find out what Kuwait is all about, to know the leaders
of Kuwait and to hear what they have to say.''
   Shaikh Saad is especially eager to draw attention to Kuwait's
view that the deployment of U.S. and allied vessels in the Persian
Gulf does not merely help Kuwait, but safeguards the world's oil
shipments, the ambassador said.
   The message will be that the United States should ``stay the
course'' as long as the gulf war continues and especially during
the transition to the next U.S. administration, Al-Sabah said.
   He predicted that the next administration, whether it be
Democrat or Republican, would maintain the policy, ``but there is
always a reevaluation.''
   As for the chance of a peaceful settlement between Iran and
Iraq, the ambassador said, ``We see no light at the end of the
tunnel. Every time our hopes are raised that this war is winding
down, we are faced with a new offensive or counteroffensive.''

<HEAD>Proposal Calls For Lite Ice Cream Category</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is being asked by a national
consumer group to create a new standard for lower-fat ``lite'' ice
cream.
   Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and
Health Policy, said Tuesday the Food and Drug Administration will
be asked to set up three standards: regular ice cream having at
least 10 percent milkfat; lite ice cream, 4 percent to 6 percent;
and ice milk, 2 percent to 4 percent.
   Currently, an ice-cream type dessert with less than 7 percent
fat must be labeled as ice milk, and the term ``ice cream'' is
reserved for those having a fat content of at least 10 percent, she
said.
   ``Historically, ice milk has been the stepchild of the ice cream
industry,'' Haas said. ``Few are aware of its comparative
nutritional benefits. Yet FDA regulations do not permit marketing
of a product called `lite ice cream'' which could be used to
stimulate sales of all lower-fat ice cream products.''
   Also, the Public Voice petition to FDA asks that manufactures
who use the new standard would have to provide nutrition
information on the package. And the label would have to state as a
percentage how much less fat the lite product is compared with
regular ice cream.
   In other words, lite ice cream would contain 40 percent to 60
percent less fat than ice cream, and ice milk's margin would be
even greater.
   Haas said nearly a dozen health and medical groups have endorsed
the proposal for lite ice cream.
   Support also came from two trade associations, the Milk Industry
Foundation and the International Ice Cream Association. A
spokeswoman, Becky Davenport, said the associations planned to file
their own petition with FDA, but would call for a slightly greater
range of fat in lite ice cream _ 5 percent to about 7 percent.
   The National Milk Producers Federation, which represents dairy
farmers and their cooperatives, has not had an opportunity to study
the proposal by Public Voice and would reserve comment until later,
said spokeswoman Doni Dondero.
   Public Voice is tackling ice cream after recently succeeding in
getting the Agriculture Department to change the name of leaner
``U.S. Good'' beef to ``U.S. Select'' as a way of attracting more
favorable consumer attention.
   ``Creation of a lower-fat ice cream standard would be good for
everyone,'' Haas said. ``Consumers would be better informed about a
healthier dessert choice. The industry would benefit from the
increased marketability of a product with clear nutritional
advantages.''
   How about the taste of lite ice cream?
   ``I've tasted it, and it's just as good,'' Haas said in a
telephone interview. ``It's a lighter-feeling taste, it's not as
rich. But I think the American palate has become light, and the
health concerns are more important than the gooey concerns.''
   Lite ice cream would be most distinctive eaten in a cone or
otherwise unadorned. That way, she said, moving down from ice cream
with 10 percent to 15 percent fat to 5 percent or 6 percent would
produce ``a noticeable difference'' to the eater.
   But if used in a sundae or banana split, with plenty of
toppings, lite ice cream becomes one of those ``gooey concerns''
and probably wouldn't be noticed.

   Triple digit temperatures have continued to
deplete soil moisture and put severe stress on crops throughout
most of the eastern half of the nation, says the government's Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility.
   ``Corn, cotton, soybeans, sorghum and spring wheat conditions
continued declining'' during the week of June 20-26, the facility
said Tuesday. ``The lack of moisture may prevent some recently
planted soybeans and sorghum from emerging.''
   Pastures were rated poor to very poor, the report said. Farmers
culled herds as pasture and hay supplies declined.
   Meanwhile, the National Farmers Union and Feed the Children
prepared to launch plans for distributing hay to stricken livestock
farmers, beginning next week in South Dakota, a spokeswoman said.
The initial shipment, involving 15 rail cars, will include hay from
Texas, Oklahoma and Mississippi, she said.
   The Agriculture Department said federal and state officials have
agreed to establish a national hay information network, or HayNet,
to help locate available hay and identify drought-stricken areas
that need forage badly.
   A number of state hay hotlines are already in operation, said
LaVerne Ausman, deputy undersecretary for small community and rural
development. The USDA and the National Association of State
Departments of Agriculture will broaden these efforts.
   ``Each week, participating states will tell USDA how much hay
they have on hand and can spare, or how much they need,'' Ausman
said. ``This information will be put into a national data bank,
available to each state by electronic mail.''
   Ausman said that individual farmers who have a supply of hay or
who need hay should contact their state department of agriculture.
   States with hotlines to date and the numbers were reported by
USDA as:
   Illinois, 1-800-541-9561.
   Iowa, 1-800-383-5079.
   Kansas, 1-800-228-5724.
   Kentucky, for in-state dialing only, 502-564-4696.
   Minnesota, 1-800-652-9747.
   Missouri, 1-800-877-4HAY.
   Ohio, 1-800-686-7246.
   South Carolina, for in-state dialing only, 803-734-2210.
   South Dakota, 1-800-228-5254.
   Wisconsin, 1-800-362-3020.
   Ausman said Indiana has targeted July 1 to start its hotline.
States with numbers to contact about hay include: Tennesee,
615-360-0117; Georgia, 404-656-3689; North Dakota, 701-224-2231;
Arkansas, 501-682-1038; and Nebraska, 402-471-4876.

   Here, at a glance, are the main points of Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's speech to the opening session of the Communist Party
conference:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The presidency _ Gorbachev proposed a more powerful head of
state chosen by a new government body and responsible for guiding
legislation and major government programs, foreign and defense
policy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Legislative reform _ A 2,250-member Congress of Deputies would
be created to review annually social, economic and constitutional
questions. A third of its members would be selected from unions and
other social organizations. It would choose from its members a
scaled-down Supreme Soviet of 400-450 members that would serve as a
standing legislature.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Local government _ Local party leaders should become the head of
the local governing council as well, which would enhance the
prestige of the local councils, or soviets, and increase
accountability.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Farm policy _ Programs should be developed to let farmers lease
land from large collective and state farms as the quickest way to
increase food production and end chronic shortages of food.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Price reform _ Reform of the state-managed price system is
``absolutely necessary,'' but a in-depth study is still under way
and the government will pass any cuts in food subsidies on to
consumers to compensate for higher prices.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Individual Rights _ Soviet citizens should be guaranteed
personal rights of privacy. The judicial system must be reformed to
ensure all are equal before the law and that each suspect is
presumed innocent when brought to trial.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Limits of liberalization _ The Communist Party won't tolerate
any political opposition. Those who seek to form an organized
opposition are abusing the process of liberalization Gorbachev has
started.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic policy _ The country's 15 republics should be given
broader economic rights, but the party leadership won't tolerate
efforts to redraw boundaries between them.

<HEAD>Few Questions Asked at Paisley Confirmation Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Melvyn R. Paisley, a central figure in the
Pentagon bribery investigation, zipped through a quick Senate
confirmation seven years ago without many questions about his
background and with nothing but praise from a leading Senate
military expert.
   Paisley was confirmed to a top Navy job after a nine-minute
hearing on Nov. 18, 1981, which was attended by only two of the 17
members of the Armed Services Committee.
   One of those two was the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., long
one of the Senate's loudest advocates of a strong military.
Jackson, who died in 1983, was frequently called ``the senator from
Boeing'' because of his military stances.
   Paisley spent 28 years at Boeing before joining the Navy in
1981. After six years in that post, he resigned in April 1987 about
the same time as his mentor, Navy Secretary John Lehman.
   Paisley opened a private business as a defense consultant and
was hired quickly by some of the nation's top defense contractors.
   Now, he is a target of the investigation into allegations that
defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military
men, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could
be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. No charges
have yet been filed in the case.
   Soon after President Reagan took office, Paisley was appointed
assistant secretary of the Navy for research, engineering and
systems.
   There have been allegations the FBI was told during a background
check for the appointment that Paisley had been involved in making
questionable payments or gifts while he was at Boeing. The
allegations were made by a former associate of Paisley's at Boeing,
by his ex-wife, and by his ex-sister-in-law.
   But none of that information is apparent from the brief hearing
on Nov. 18, 1981. It ended with approval of Paisley's nomination on
a voice vote. The full Senate approved Paisley's nomination five
days later.
   The FBI has refused to release results of the background check,
citing privacy restrictions.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a member of the Armed Services
Committee, has asked the FBI for that record but hasn't yet
received a reply, Willie Blacklow, a spokesman for Levin said
Tuesday. Levin was not on the committee in 1981.
   Levin also asked the White House for its file on the Paisley
nomination, but the request was rejected for unspecified reasons,
Blacklow said.
   The Senate was controlled by Republicans in 1981 and former Sen.
John Tower, R-Texas, was chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
Attempts to contact Tower were unsuccessful Tuesday.
   Scott Maxwell, a spokesman for Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the current
Armed Services chairman, said committee staff members were unable
to find a letter from Paisley's ex-sister-in-law warning against
Paisley's confirmation.
   The hearing transcript from Paisley's confirmation gives no hint
of any controversy.
   Only two senators were present: Jackson and Roger Jepsen, the
Iowa Republican who was acting as chairman of the committee.
   Jackson, who died five years ago, said Paisley's work at Boeing
had given him ``the experience and great management skills that are
essential for research and development work for the Navy.''
   Paisley was asked only two questions, both of them relating to
potential future Navy problems.
   In his brief prepared statement, Paisley said the Navy had too
many programs in research and said he wanted to reduce that number
because ``we are stretched too thin to be able to carry out all
these programs both efficiently and effectively with the resources
we can hope to obtain in the years ahead.''
   In fact, the Navy was on the verge of four years of sharp budget
increases as it moved toward a 600-ship fleet that was part of
President Reagan's record peacetime military build-up.
   Paisley told the panel that ``we have too many programs in R&D
(research and development) that do not get into production. It is
very difficult to select those programs that are going to continue
into production and I think we have to prove that process.
   ``Having selected a program, we must move it rapidly into the
fleet,'' he continued. ``It takes much too long to put a program
into the fleet; it just takes much too long.''

<HEAD>Former Navy Secretary Says He Kept Carlucci In Dark About
Investigation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Defense Probe Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Navy Secretary James H. Webb says he
learned last fall of a massive fraud investigation and deliberately
kept Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in the dark, figuring the
FBI would tell him when it wanted to.
   Webb, in a telephone interview Tuesday, also said he was told
from the start that former Navy official Melvyn R. Paisley was a
``central figure'' in the probe and that a member of his
headquarters staff was under scrutiny.
   Webb said he wasn't told and didn't ask the identity of the
official on his staff under investigation.
   FBI search warrants suggest the Navy official is James Gaines,
the deputy assistant secretary for acquisition management.
   Webb said he never attempted to discuss the matter with Carlucci
because ``that wasn't my job.''
   ``This was a very close-hold report involving an investigation
being conducted by the FBI with the NIS (Naval Investigative
Service) cooperating, not the Department of Defense,'' he said.
   ``My view was that if the FBI wanted to tell Carlucci, they
would tell him. How should I know whether they wanted to tell him?
Why should I get tangled up in all that?''
   Pentagon spokesmen have said Carlucci did not learn of the probe
until June 13, the day before FBI agents began executing search
warrants at the Pentagon and elsewhere around the country.
   The former Navy chief added he was originally told the
investigation would probably be completed by last Christmas, ``but
it kept getting delayed because the net kept expanding.''
   Webb, a Vietnam War hero, lawyer, novelist and former assistant
defense secretary, became the secretary of the Navy in April 1987
after the resignation of John F. Lehman Jr., who had held the post
for six years.
   Paisley was an assistant secretary of the Navy and one of
Lehman's top aides. He left at the same time Lehman did and
established a defense consulting business.
   ``I was, in fact, briefed about this last fall,'' Webb said.
``And I was then periodically updated on it by the chief of the
Naval Investigative Service.
   ``I was told that with respect to the Navy, Paisley was the
central figure. I was also told an individual still on my staff was
under investigation.''
   After the briefing, Webb said, he did two things.
   ``I told them I didn't want to know who it was on my staff, but
please try to hurry up and get the investigation done if that was
the case,'' Webb said. ``I didn't like the idea of someone
committing felonies when I'm trying to reorganize (with new people).
   ``And I also asked the NIS to communicate to the FBI my concern
that if they were investigating Paisley, it be for substantive
matters because of Paisley's relationship with Lehman. I didn't
want it to appear to be a witch hunt.''
   According to the Justice Department, the NIS began the current
investigation two years ago and then called in the FBI. Justice
officials say the inquiry centers on allegations that Pentagon
executives took bribes from private military consultants who were
seeking classified contract information for defense contractors.
   Webb said his knowledge of details of the investigation always
was limited.
   Asked if he was told there were other ``central figures''
working for other armed services or on the Pentagon staff, Webb
replied, ``No comment.''
   Webb also said that long before he knew of the investigation, he
canceled a consulting contract between Paisley and the Navy that
allowed Paisley to keep his security clearance for super-secret
``black'' program information.
   The consulting arrangement was established shortly before Webb
took over as Navy secretary. Webb said he canceled it as soon as he
learned of its existence, less than a week after assuming office.
   ``The arrangement kind of bothered me, the access to black
information (for a consultant),'' Webb said.

<HEAD>Sponsor of Child-Care Measure Urges National Day Care Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate sponsor of a $2.5 billion child
care expansion bill says he's willing to compromise on some parts
of the measure but won't give up on minimum national standards for
day care providers.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., told two governors urging
continued state regulation of day care that they would be ``shocked
to find the tremendous disparity in standards'' from state to state.
   Dodd later said he would not abandon the minimum health, safety,
training, staff ratio and other standards called for in his Act for
Better Child Care, or ABC bill, in favor of standards meant to
serve as models for the states.
   ``You are deluding yourself if you believe model standards get
used,'' he told reporters. ``They've got to be more than that.''
   Dodd, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
subcommittee on children, family, drugs and alcoholism, held a
hearing, a luncheon, two panel discussions and a reception Tuesday
to discuss the ABC bill.
   Three-fourths of the ABC money would help pay day care expenses
for families making less than 115 percent of a state's median
income. The remaining money would be for training and salaries of
child care workers, renovation of facilities and referral programs
for parents.
   Money would only be available to day care homes and centers that
met minimum federal standards developed by an advisory panel. The
bill is supported by scores of groups representing women, children,
labor and medical personnel.
   The lead-off hearing witnesses, Govs. Bill Clinton of Arkansas
and Thomas Kean of New Jersey, representing the National Governors
Association, said they are anxious for a day care initiative this
year even if it is less generous than the plan envisioned by Dodd.
   ``Don't pass nothing just because you can't get as much money as
you want,'' Clinton, a Democrat, told Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
after Harkin said child care boosters would never be able to get
$2.5 billion.
   ``Whatever way you can help us, we need that help,'' added Kean,
a Republican. ``Whatever money you give us will be put to
extraordinarily good use.''
   Clinton and Kean asked Dodd to reconsider several aspects of the
ABC bill, most of them the same provisions that have sparked
criticism from conservative lawmakers and lobbyists.
   The governors' concerns included the mandatory national provider
standards as well as eligibility standards for day care aid. With
the cutoff at 115 percent of median state income, some families
making $40,000 would qualify.
   Clinton and Kean also said the private sector should be given
incentives to play a bigger role in day care, and states should be
able to use federal money flexibly, perhaps through a broad child
care block grant.
   Dodd said he would continue working with the governors on his
bill. He told reporters that ``it could be argued that we've gone a
little too high'' on the income eligibility standards but said he
wants lower middle income taxpayers to support the program.
   ``We're trying to reach up to those people... who don't fall
into the poverty category but still need some assistance,'' Dodd
said. ``There's a substantive need as well as a political
justification for giving these people some help. But it's not a
yuppie bill. The bulk of this assistance goes to people who are in
desperate need of help.''
   Over 100 child care bills are pending in Congress, introduced by
lawmakers from all across the political spectrum. Some offer tax
incentives to businesses to start child care centers while others
offer tax credits to all families with preschool children. One bill
would increase the existing social services block grant, and
another would limit provider liability through insurance risk
pools. Other proposals involve vouchers for poor families and aid
to providers for capital improvements.

<HEAD>Parliament Outlaws Tobacco Ads, Smoking in Federally Regulated
Areas</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All dollar figures U.S.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Parliament has banned tobacco advertising and
forbidden smoking in federally regulated workplaces and
transportation.
   The Senate on Tuesday passed two bills that the tobacco industry
had fought for more than a year. The bills, approved May 30 by the
House of Commons, were signed Tuesday by Governor General Jeanne
Sauve.
   One bill calls for smoke-free workplaces in companies regulated
by the federal government. That includes banks, telecommunications
firms and Crown corporations.
   The measure also guarantees smoke-free traveling on planes,
ships, trains and buses that offer passenger service and are
federally regulated.
   The second bill, bans tobacco ads on television, radio,
newspapers, billboards and magazines.
   The tobacco industry said the prohibition on ads amounted to an
infringement on the right of freedom of speech. The ad ban takes
effect next Jan. 1, but some signs will be permitted until 1993.
   Imported broadcasts and publications may still carry tobacco
ads. About two-thirds of the periodicals distributed in Canada come
from the United States.
   Another section of the bill outlaws free samples of tobacco. All
tobacco products will have to carry a health warning approved by
the federal government.
   Companies violating the strict provisions may be fined up to
$300,000.
   Tobacco is a $4.8 billion industry in Canada and employs 60,000
people. One quarter of the Canadian population smokes. The habit is
blamed for contributing to 35,000 deaths a year in Canada.
   Governments at every level have tightened restrictions on
smoking. The federal government has banned smoking on commercial
airline flights of two hours or less, and many cities already
outlaw smoking in the workplace except for designated rooms.

   Dizzy Gillespie's big band, appearing after
intermission Tuesday at Carnegie Hall in the JVC Jazz Festival, was
exciting, driving, crisp and bright.
   Gillespie himself, in his utterances _ ``I'm in New York now; I
got to show off'' _ in conducting with a hip wiggle and in playing
his bent-bell trumpet, brought joy to the Tuesday night concert. He
followed a brief set by Marlon Jordan, 17-year-old trumpeter from
New Orleans, and his mainstream quartet and an hour by singer
Carmen McRae, who was in a joyless mood.
   Gillespie's band began on a peak of musical excitement, with
``Toccata'' from ``Gillespiana Suite,'' composed by Lalo Schifrin.
The four French horns used in that piece then left the stage to the
17-piece band, which sustained the pace with ``Emanon.'' Dizzy said
he composed it for a recording in the 1940s and named it ``No
Name'' backwards.
   Trumpeter Jon Faddis played exceedingly high and fast with
absolute definition and clarity in ``A Night in Tunisia.'' Dizzy
introduced that one as ``a tune closely associated with me over
many, many, many decades, mainly because I wrote it. It has
withstood the visicitudes of the contingent world and moved in an
odyssy into the realm of the metaphysical.''
   Saxophonist Sam Rivers was warmly melodic in ``Round Midnight.''
The concert ended with some bop for big band, Gillespie's 1940s
``Things To Come.''
   Miss McRae sang ``For All We Know'' and ``Inside a Silent Tear''
with depth of feeling for the lyrics but conveyed a lack of joy in
what she was doing.
   Her usual pianist, Eric Gunnison, was joined by bassist George
Mraz and drummer Al Foster, who were on an album she has cut of
Thelonious Monk songs.
   They were joined for seven interesting Monk songs by the
outstanding saxophonist Clifford Jordan.
   Most of the Monk songs she sang had lyrics by Jon Hendricks.
They included ``Ruby, My Dear,'' ``Ugly Beauty,'' ``Monk's Dream,''
``Straight, No Chaser'' and ``In Walked Bud.''

<DATELINE>FORT BERTHOLD INDIAN RESERVATION, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The white men who
took the West's land and water from the Indians promised their
treaties would last ``as long as the grass grows and the water
flows.''
   This year, no grass grows and no water flows on the Fort
Berthold Indian Reservation.
   But the summer's devastating heat and lack of rain has special
bitterness for the almost 4,000 members of the Three Affiliated
Tribes who live on the reservation. They feel long-broken promises
by the government helped destroy a way of life that might have
allowed them to weather the drought.
   The elders who are enduring 106-degree days and cloudless skies
atop sunbaked Missouri River bluffs remember the 1930s drought,
before the big dams came. Then, Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Indians
lived in the river bottoms and were nearly self-sufficient through
the Great Depression.
   ``We were well-off by the standards of people trying to survive
off agriculture,'' recalled Jim Danks, an Indian rancher. ``We had
irrigated community gardens, meadowlands planted in hay and clover
and flooded by spring runoff which we used to feed our cattle, and
we mined coal and harvested timber off the riverbanks to stay warm
in the winter.
   ``We sold vegetables and our homemade jellies and wild fruit to
white settlers who came down to the river from the upper lands, so
the only things we bought were flour, sugar and baking powder.
   ``Unemployment was less than 3 percent, nearly everybody lived
on the reservation, and the word `welfare' was unknown to us,''
said Danks.
   ``Those were just dry years for the tribes, not devastation,
because of the resources we had from the river. Now, living without
its blessings, we are facing devastation if it doesn't rain pretty
quick.''
   Today Danks, like all tribal members still on the million-acre
reservation, must live high above Lake Sakakawea on the treeless,
flat prairie. He has no irrigated hay meadows or clover, no
naturally watered gardens, no coal, no timber. In a year of scant
but normal rainfall, his 300 cows and their new calves barely
prosper on 6,000 acres of owned and rented land.
   Danks' five sons, like half the tribe's members, have had to
find jobs elsewhere. Each tried ranching. Past droughts and
unrelenting debt doomed them. They are now scattered from North
Dakota to Arizona, collecting paychecks on construction sites.
   ``Most of the ranchers my age ... we've barely managed to hold
things together,'' said Danks, 61. ``I never thought this kind of
drought would happen again in my lifetime. This one could take the
final equity we've managed to hold onto and flush it down the
drain. I wonder if I can salvage anything.''
   Danks is descended from generations of farmers. Hidatsas,
Arikaras and Mandans were riverbottom agrarians when explorers
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, the first of many white men who
wanted something, showed up seeking food in 1804.
   Nearly 150 years later, Washington ordered the tribes to move to
high ground and abandon their traditional life. Congress forced
them out to create Lake Sakakawea behind the giant Garrison Dam,
one of five built in Montana and the Dakotas after World War II to
tame the Missouri. The government said it needed to drown the
Indians' bottomlands to halt spring floods downstream, create a
navigable channel through Middle America and generate power.
   As the dam's gates closed and the waters rose, the Indians
reluctantly accepted $24 an acre and moved to the bluffs in
exchange for promises of a vast irrigation system, first crack at
the new reservoir's water, cheap electricity, a hospital and two
bridges across the river to keep the tribe united.
   Today, despite attempts by the sons and daughters of dead chiefs
to force lawmakers to honor broken promises, they have one bridge,
no irrigation, no hospital and they pay the same electric rates as
others in the region. Some residents have no water, some endure
brown, turbid stuff pumped from wells, and many more must store
expensive hauled water in cisterns. It's too expensive for the
tribes to pump water from the lake below the bluffs.
   Tribal leaders estimate unemployment on the reservation at 70
percent. They say half the households receive federal assistance,
and women head one-third of the families.
   Tribal leaders say that of 90 Indian families recently involved
in farming, only 40 are active; the rest are in foreclosure, have
retired or have given up. Jim Danks is hanging on, but for how long?
   ``Had the government come through with all its promises, we (the
tribes) could have made it, we could probably have even gotten
through this drought in pretty good shape,'' said Danks. ``We
absolutely believed it would all come true when we left the river,
but the politicians never even introduced the measures into
Congress.
   ``Now I've seen three generations sit out here and not get a
single drop of water from that reservoir, except what we can haul
away in our buckets to make coffee. Now I think it was all a hoax
right from the start.''
   Danks estimates he's got the patience, the grass and the water
to last 60 days longer. After that, if there's been no rain, he'll
have to get rid of his cattle no matter how low the price.
   Surveying his stunted hay crop, his thirsty animals and the
distant, shimmering water of the Missouri River, Danks said:
   ``God, I miss those early days, down on the river. ... They were
such good days.''

<HEAD>Senate Committee Votes Change In Control Over Program Funding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee wants to curtail the
authority of the presidentially appointed Corporation for Public
Broadcasting and give much of the federal money for public
television directly to the TV stations.
   Senate advocates of the proposal say it would better insulate
program-funding decisions for public TV from politics and address
complaints from independent producers who want more of the public
TV programming money.
   The proposal, part of a package of changes in the way federal
money is distributed to public TV stations, was approved
unanimously by the Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday as an
amendment to CPB's funding for fiscal years 1991-93. Some of the
changes would take effect earlier.
   The measure now goes to the Senate floor.
   A similar CPB budget bill in the House, expected to be approved
by an Energy and Commerce subcommittee today, contains none of the
Senate panel's proposals. But the House panel may consider changes
that would give independent producers greater access to public TV
funds.
   The Senate committee's proposed changes have divided the public
broadcasting community. CPB says the measure would have dire
consequences, while the Public Broadcasting Service, the private
organization of public TV stations that provides programming to
members stations, supports the bill.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said he proposed the changes
because of concerns that ``CPB funding decisions are not
sufficiently insulated from political'' influence since CPB board
members are appointed by the president.
   He also said he was concerned about complaints from independent
producers that they lack access to the public broadcasting system.
   But Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said he was concerned about
how the proposal would affect national programming, ``the heart of
the public television system.''
   The changes would fund public television in much the same way
National Public Radio is financed.
   Under the measure, about 80 percent of the $37 million that now
goes into CPB's national programming fund would be distributed
directly to stations for the purchase of national programs. CPB
would be left with about $8.5 million, which it would spend on new
programs.
   Committee staff members say that under the proposal, CPB would
have about $2 million more than it now spends on new programs. The
proposal would not be able to support a program for more than four
years out of this fund.
   After four years, a program would have to find its support from
public TV stations and other sources. The theory is that if the
stations like the program, they will buy it and continue support
for it.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said the changes would give local
public TV stations more control over the programming they broadcast
and allow them to serve their communities better.
   ``These local stations are much more sophisticated than they
were 20 years ago,'' he said.
   But with the end of CPB as a central funding office, the
stations would have to find another mechanism for pooling their
money to support national programming, posing a risk to the entire
public TV system, CPB said.
   CPB said the proposal would leave it with only about $8 million
of the $19 million it had intended to spend in fiscal 1990 on
programs for children and minorities and programs by independent
producers.
   ``We simply won't be able to fulfill promises made in this
bill,'' CPB President Donald Ledwig said in a statement.
   ``There is no guarantee that television program funds going to
stations will be reaggregated at the same level of national program
support, posing a dangerous threat to the long-term identity of
public television in an increasingly competitive environment.''
   But PBS President Bruce L. Christensen said the bill would
``enhance the independence of the programming process.'' He said
the measure reflects ``the ability of local public broadcasting
licensees to make programming decisions that best serve the needs
of their communities.''

<HEAD>FAA Slow On Safety Violation Follow-Ups, Officials Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shortage of staff attorneys is causing the
Federal Aviation Administration to have more and more difficulties
following up on the growing number of safety violations its
inspectors uncover, government officials say.
   Inspector General John W. Melchner of the Department of
Transportation told a House subcommittee Tuesday that it often
takes the FAA ``an inordinate amount of time to process'' cases
against people or companies found to have violated safety
regulations. About 45 percent of the cases have been open for more
than a year, he said.
   Melchner told members of the House Public Works Committee's
investigations and oversight subcommittee that the number of
violations discovered by FAA inspectors has more than doubled from
28,864 in 1984 to 63,391 in 1987.
   Despite that growth, the FAA added only 17 additional lawyers to
handle the growing volume of cases, he said.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor agreed, complaining that
although the FAA has been building up its force of safety
inspectors, the number of attorneys who handle the problems that
are discovered has not kept pace.
   ``It will do us little good to continue to increase our
inspector levels if we cannot attain the necessary complement of
lawyers to take enforcement actions against safety violators
uncovered by our inspectors,'' McArtor said.
   Melchner said the number of FAA inspectors has grown from 1,320
in 1984 to 1,930 last year, and there are plans to hire 1,028 more
by 1991. Inspectors examine the operations of airlines and
privately owned aircraft, airports and service companies.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said there are 129 FAA lawyers.
Sixty-eight of them work in field offices across the country and
handle most of the violations uncovered, he said.
   McArtor said his agency has ``probably its highest backlog
ever'' of cases its lawyers are trying to pursue. He said he did
not have statistics about the backed-up cases.
   At the same hearing, Melchner faulted the FAA for inadequately
investigating complaints from three Ryan Air Service pilots that
the Alaskan airline pressured them to make overloaded flights.
   One of the three pilots, who unsuccessfully had sought immunity
from the FAA in exchange for testimony about falsified flight
records, was later among 18 people killed in an accident that was
blamed on an excessively heavy load of passengers and cargo.
   As a result of the Ryan Air crash, the FAA official who decided
against granting immunity to the pilots was reassigned, the FAA
changed some of its investigative procedures and the government
halted Ryan Air's flights.
   Melchner told the subcommittee that his investigation of the
FAA's response to the pilots' complaints ``did not find a
well-coordinated, aggressive safety enforcement program in place in
the Alaska region.''
   Melchner also said he could not explain why the FAA's counsel
who was responsible for Alaska, Donald Boberick, decided not to
grant immunity to the pilots.
   According to Melchner, a Ryan Air mechanic approached FAA
officials in September 1986 on behalf of the three pilots, asking
for immunity for the pilots in exchange for testimony about false
information they said was being supplied about flight loads.
   One of the pilots was killed when a Ryan flight crashed at
Homer, Alaska, last Nov. 23. That flight was later found to have
been overweight by 460 pounds.
   Last January, the Anchorage Daily News reported that the three
pilots had made their offer to the FAA. The article sparked
Melchner's investigation, the results of which were sent to McArtor
in March.

   House tax writers are moving toward completion
of a catchall bill that would hand out billions of dollars in tax
breaks, raise corporate levies to pay for them, and fix hundreds of
mistakes in the 1986 income tax law.
   The panel on Tuesday OK'd $5.6 billion in corporate tax hikes
over the next three years to offset tax breaks the panel plans for
farmers and others.
   The committee is scheduled to decide today on another tax hike _
a proposal to take away some of the tax breaks given for
single-premium life insurance.
   Critics say studies show the policies, with tax-free earnings
and interest-free borrowing back from the premium, are a shelter
for the wealthy. But the insurance industry has been lobbying to
limit any crackdown.
   The committee needs to raise taxes to pay for the revenue-losing
provisions it included in the bill, such as repealing the
requirement that farmers and other off-road users of diesel fuel
pay the 15.1 cent per gallon federal tax.
   On Tuesday, the panel voted:
   _To squeeze $2.4 billion from defense contractors and some large
construction companies by repealing an accounting method that
allowed them to delay taxes until long-term projects are completed.
   _To raise $1.5 billion by gradually reducing the tax deduction
for dividends received by corporations owning less than 20 percent
of another company.
   _Speed up tax collection from companies with incomes that vary
widely from year to year, raising $869 million.
   _Repeal tax rules that were designed to benefit corporations of
Alaska natives, but which the committee said were being abused and
would cost the government $825 million over the next three years.
   The committee also voted to extend, with some changes, a tax
formula designed to encourage U.S. corporations to conduct their
research and development in this country.
   The decisions were all made by voice vote, according to
committee staff members who briefed reporters after the session.
   The underlying reason for the tax bill this year is to correct
hundreds of errors included in the massive 1986 tax overhaul. Many
of them are technical, such as incorrect legal citations.

   A major defense contractor has developed a
tiny computer chip that can be used to keep track of potential
invaders _ killer bees.
   Engineers for Martin Marietta, known for producing MX missiles
and laser-guided artillery shells, developed the tracking chip at
the Oak Ridge (Tenn.) National Laboratory, the Bethesda-based
company said Tuesday.
   The microchip, about the size of a half-carat diamond and
weighing about as much as a grain of salt, is part of an integrated
circuit that would be attached to captured bees' midsections.
   The device, powered by nine solar cells, can transmit an
infrared signal that can be picked up by a ground station up to a
mile away.
   ``What we've done so far ... is establish that the bee could
indeed fly with the chip'' attached, said Ed Aebischer, a spokesman
at the laboratory. ``The entomologists have looked at it and
they're convinced that it's workable.''
   A working killer bee transmitter is expected to be in the field
by next year.
   Killer bees, which are aggressive but generally not deadly, are
the descendants of Africa queen bees. Since escaping from a
Brazilian laboratory in 1957, they have migrated as far as southern
Mexico, and are expected to cross into Texas as early as next year.
   Scientists hope that by being able to track the insects they can
control the migration without using large quantities of pesticides.

<HEAD>Towns Resort To Old New England Tradition To Settle Border Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Instead of spending thousands of dollars
for a surveyor to settle a longstanding border dispute, the towns
of Ashford and Willington plan to resort to an old New England
tradition: walking the line.
   After local officials balked at the $40,000 cost for a survey,
an arbitration panel suggested they resort to the method used for
centuries by New England farmers to re-establish property lines
each spring after winter weather demolished sections of the stone
fences dividing their fields.
   The three selectmen from each town tentatively plan to walk
about 20 acres of disputed land on July 6 and decide among
themselves where the border should be, Ashford First Selectwoman
Paula Faulkner said Tuesday.
   ``What will happen when we walk the line, I'm not sure,''
Faulkner said.
   Poet Robert Frost immortalized the annual ritual among farmers
in his poem ``Mending Wall.'' Connecticut statute once required
that officials from neighboring towns also walk the line every 10
years to maintain boundaries, said Albert Fitzback, a surveyor and
member of the court-appointed, three-member arbitration panel.
   Ashford, which measures 40 square miles, was incorporated in
1714 and has 3,400 residents. Willington, a town of 35 square miles
with 5,000 residents, was incorporated 13 years later. Dairy
farming is the principal industry in the northeastern Connecticut
towns.
   At issue is an 8-mile-long, 1-mile-wide strip that the General
Assembly took from Ashford when Willington was incorporated.
   Ashford authorities contend the border originally was drawn as a
straight line, but Willington officials have relied on markers
placed in 1916 that create a slight jog in the line.
   The crooked line was used for years in countless deeds and other
documents, apparently without argument from either town.
   But in 1985, Ashford ordered an aerial survey of the town as
part of a property revaluation and reverted to the straight-line
border, thereby claiming the 20-acre wedge as its own. The new line
straddles about a dozen properties and some residents are receiving
tax bills from both towns.
   The towns went to court last year and a Superior Court judge
appointed the arbitration panel to settle the dispute.
   The panel spend months poring over land records, including a
1726 map stored in Willington's vault. The map appeared to show a
straight line in the disputed area and the panel eventually
concluded that ``the line has always been and should remain a
straight line.''
   The panel suggested the towns pay for a survey to set the
border, but local officials didn't want to spend $40,000 for it and
asked for another way, Faulkner said.
   Douglas Vonasek, who is now paying taxes to both towns on his 18
acres of land, said he doesn't care which town his property ends up
in, as long as it's only in one of them.
   ``I'd like to see this thing settled once and for all,'' said
Vonasek, who figures the dispute is costing him about $100 a year
in extra taxes.
   It remains uncertain whether walking the line will resolve the
dispute.
   Willington Assessor Joan L. LeBlond questioned the accuracy of
Ashford's aerial survey showing the boundary as straight and said
the crooked border has been accepted since 1916. Such longtime,
unchallenged use should constitute the legal boundary, she said.
   ``I say, let sleeping dogs lie,'' LeBlond said. ``I'm sure there
are many towns where the boundaries jog a little bit. There's
nothing that says it has to be a straight line.''
   But Susan M. Sibiga, a former Ashford selectwoman who has
researched the matter extensively, is just as adamant that the new
straight line should be upheld.
   ``We spent a lot of time on this and the map clearly shows it is
a straight line,'' she said. ``This thing should have been settled
years ago.''
   And if the two towns still can't agree after walking the line?
   ``Then I guess we would have to spend the $40,000,'' Faulkner
said.

<HEAD>New Trial Set In Newman Lawsuit</HEAD>

   Paul Newman may have to undergo another
round of his food fight with a delicatessen owner who wants a share
of the actor's culinary profits, attorneys say.
   A lawsuit ended in a mistrial last week after jurors sent a note
to Superior Court Judge Howard Zoarski saying they couldn't ignore
depositions that weren't admitted as evidence but were
inadvertently given to them during deliberations.
   Julius Gold alleged during the three-week trial that an attorney
for Newman promised him 8 percent of the stock from Newman's Own
Inc. Gold said he contributed 30 months' effort to Newman's food
company and believed that his work led to the corporation's success.
   Gold sued Newman; his two food companies, Newman's Own Inc., and
Salad King Inc; Newman's friend and business associate, author A.E.
Hotchner; and food distributor David Kalman.
   The defendants denied the allegations.
   Attorneys for both sides said Tuesday that a new trial is
scheduled to begin in Bridgeport Superior Court in early November.

<TEXT>
   The owners of a possible prison site that is the
subject of an FBI investigation for its selection deny any improper
dealings with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis or any member of
his administration.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential nominee,
insisted Tuesday the state would not pay ``one dime more'' for the
land in New Braintree, Mass., than it is worth.
   At issue is whether Daniel Striar and Gary Jacobson received
insider information that prompted them to offer to the state for
$9.5 million in 1986 land they had bought a year earlier for $3.2
million.
   Striar and Jacobson said they had no idea until February 1986 _
exactly a year after they signed a purchase and sales agreement for
the 782 acres of property and three months after they bought it _
that the state was interested in the land as a prison.
   New Braintree residents, who have opposed the proposed prison in
their town for two years, have accused Striar and Jacobson of
acting as middlemen between the former owner, the Seventh Day
Adventist Church, and the state, which has a severe shortage of
prison space.
   ``Instead of pursuing it in a legitimate fashion, (New Braintree
residents) chose to take a series of trivial and irrelevant facts
and make them appear as if they were dirty and sinister,'' Jacobson
said.
   Jacobson, 50, lived for several years in Dukakis' neighborhood
in Brookline during his teens. He also has contributed to Dukakis'
gubernatorial and presidential campaigns.
   But Jacobson denied he is a close associate of the governor.
``I'm probably the only citizen of Brookline who is not claiming to
be the closest friend of Governor Dukakis,'' he said.
   Striar, 52, has been linked to Dukakis through a September 1986
dedication ceremony for a Stoughton Jewish community center named
after Striar's parents. Dukakis and Striar attended the ceremony
but Striar said he uttered one word to the governor: ``Hello.''
   Dukakis, appearing at a housing promotion event in Boston, said,
``I didn't know Striar ... I didn't have the slightest interest in
who the owner of the property was.'' He added that, ``I think that
the business of throwing charges around is absurd.''
   Striar defended the $9.5 million asking price.
   ``I looked at this piece of property and I felt it was a
steal,'' said Striar, who has participated in a number of real
estate ventures with Jacobson.
   ``Dr. Jacobson (who is a psychiatrist) and I decided to buy the
property as a real estate speculation,'' Striar said. He said the
town stood in the way of their development efforts, forcing them to
entertain the state's offer a year later to buy the property for a
prison.
   Dorothea Thomas-Vitrac, a New Braintree selectman, said the town
did oppose some of the condominium and recreational development
proposals put forth by Striar and Jacobson. But she said the town
never opposed their original plan to use the land for a psychiatric
hospital.
   Striar and Jacobson also said they have had no contact with the
FBI.

<HEAD>Former Pennsylvania Governor Seen As Possible Bush Running Mate</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: One in a series of occasional profiles of vice presidential
prospects</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since ending his second term as Pennsylvania
governor in 1986, Dick Thornburgh has hardly retreated from the
public eye.
   Thornburgh, 55, has been heading the Institute of Politics at
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. He has been
asked to head the FBI and the Agency for International Development.
And he has been busier than ever on the political circuit back home.
   All that visibility helps fuel talk of Thornburgh as a potential
running mate for Republican presidential nominee-to-be George Bush.
   Thornburgh also has been said to be considering running for
governor again when Democrat Robert Casey comes up for re-election
in 1990.
   ``He's a politician,'' his longtime aide, David Runkel, said in
a telephone interview. ``He has not closed the door on another
campaign for something.''
   The Bush campaign has said it is too early to speculate about
the search for a running mate. And Thornburgh said there is little
he can do, whether he wants the job or not.
   ``You don't campaign for the office of vice president. There's
only one vote that counts, and that's the vote of the candidate,''
Thornburgh told reporters recently in State College, Pa.
   ``I'm sure the vice president is concentrating on his own short
list of prospective candidates, but I think it's really quite
premature for even speculation to be undertaken because of the fact
that I think he will factor in the choice made by the Democrats in
Atlanta,'' Thornburgh said.
   The Republican convention does not begin until August 15 in New
Orleans. The Democrats meet a month earlier in Atlanta.
   If Thornburgh were asked, he says, ``It would certainly be
something I would give serious consideration to.''
   Thornburgh's recent activity has included two fund raisers that
have netted about $100,000 for the ``Governor Thornburgh
Committee,'' an account he uses to support his travels on behalf of
other candidates, Runkel said.
   In addition, Thornburgh is co-chairman of Pennsylvania's
``Victory '88,'' a fund that distributes money for phone banks and
other Republican campaign efforts.
   ``Victory '88,'' which has $30,000 in the coffers now, is hoping
to raise $600,000 by bringing Bush to Pennsylvania for fund-raising
events in August, Republican officials said.
   The possibility of a Bush-Thornburgh ticket has excited
Pennsylvania's Republican convention delegates, many of whom have
named the former governor as their top choice for the second spot
on the ticket.
   ``He's the most outstanding governor I've served under, and I've
been here for 24 years,'' said Republican State Rep. James Gallen
of Shillington, who won a delegate spot in the April primary.
Gallen said it would make sense for Thornburgh to be picked by Bush
``since he's from Pennsylvania, and it's a key state.''
   U.S. Rep. William Clinger, R-Pa., said Thornburgh would help
neutralize the support of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the
Northeast and especially in Pennsylvania, where Democrats enjoy a
voter registration advantage of more than 500,000.
   But other delegates said Thornburgh might be too similar to Bush
to form a well-rounded ticket. Both are Yale University graduates
who maintain ties to the Northeast, Thornburgh as a Pennsylvanian
and Bush as a part-time of resident of Maine.
   In 1975, Thornburgh served under President Ford as assistant
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's criminal
division.
   He was staunchly loyal to the Reagan administration, frequently
testifying on Capitol Hill on behalf of the president's proposal
for line-item veto power and a constitutional amendment to balance
the budget. He turned down offers to head the FBI and AID, and was
considered for Margaret Heckler's health and human services Cabinet
post in 1985.
   As governor, Thornburgh said his budget proposals held spending
increases to less than the rate of inflation for eight straight
years. He championed a controversial welfare reform law that
limited an estimated 68,000 people considered ``able-bodied'' to
three months of cash benefits a year.

   The drought may have shrunk the Ohio
River, but it hasn't dried up plans for construction of the
Louisville Falls Fountain, billed as the world's tallest.
   The first of four concrete caissons being implanted in the river
bed was built Tuesday in preparation for the fountain's arrival.
   The structure is being built in Tennessee, and is scheduled to
be floated up the Tennessee and Ohio rivers later this month.
   The fountain, financed by a $2.6 million gift from the Mary and
Barry Bingham Sr. Fund, is intended as a national landmark and a
new symbol for Louisville, reflecting its river heritage.
   It was described as the largest floating fountain in the world
by Louisville Central Area, the downtown planning agency.
   At peak performance, water will jet 375 feet into the air as the
fountain pumps 15,800 gallons of river water a minute.
   Four smaller jets will spray water 75 feet high, and 24 others
will spray 10 feet high, creating a fleur-de-lis, the symbol of
Louisville.
   The drought, which has caused barge backlogs on the Ohio, has
not affected plans for transporting the fountain, said Louisville
Central Area spokesman Errol Frailey.

   Here are some facts and figures on the Teamsters union:
   Official name: The International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America.
   Formed: 1903.
   Membership: A general membership of 1.6 million, making it the
largest union in the United States. Besides truck drivers, the
union represents a variety of workers, including flight attendants
and supermarket workers.
   Affiliation: The Teamsters were expelled in 1957 from the
AFL-CIO for high-level corruption. They rejoined the federation
last October.
   Legal troubles: The union's problems with prosecutors go back
decades. Four of the union's past five presidents have been
indicted or convicted.
   _ In 1957, president Dave Beck was convicted of misuse of union
funds.
   _ In 1967, Jimmy Hoffa, who took over when Beck resigned, was
imprisoned on jailed on a 1964 jury tampering conviction. He was
freed in 1971 when President Nixon commuted his sentence, and
disappeared in 1975 and is believed to have been murdered.
   _ The next president, Frank Fitzsimmons, was investigated but
never indicted and died in office in 1981.
   _ In 1983, president Roy Williams resigned after being convicted
of conspiracy to bribe a U.S. senator. He is serving a prison
sentence.
   _ The current president, Jackie Presser, is under indictment in
Cleveland for an alleged ghost employee scheme. He is on leave from
the union following surgery last month for a brain tumor.

<TEXT>
   Teamsters president Jackie Presser, who is
suffering from brain tumors, was in serious condition early today
after being readmitted to a hospital, officials said.
   Presser, 61, was alert and conscious when he was brought to
Lakewood Hospital's emergency room Tuesday afternoon, said David
Hopcraft, a hospital spokesman.
   Hours earlier, federal prosecutors in New York sued the union in
an attempt to end its alleged domination by organized crime and
force labor reforms.
   WKYC-TV reported Presser was in the hospital's cardiac care unit
and was being watched closely because doctors suspected he had a
pulmonary embolism, a blood clot. The television station reported
that an unidentified source in the hospital said doctors were
trying to determine how to treat the condition and if he should be
moved to another hospital.
   Presser has been tested and treated for brain cancer at the
Cleveland Clinic.
   Hopcraft said doctors did not expect Presser's condition to
change in the near future. Hopcraft would not confirm or deny that
Presser was in the cardiac care unit.
   He said Presser's condition was not related to brain tumors,
which have disabled the union leader.
   U.S. District Court Judge George White, in a ruling June 7,
postponed Presser's July 12 trial on racketeering and embezzlement
charges, citing Presser's bout with brain tumors. Two co-defendants
are to be tried July 12.
   White ruled after Presser's physicians said Presser was
undergoing radiation treatment for brain tumors and might have less
than six months to live.
   Dr. Leslie Sheeler of the Cleveland Clinic, in a May 26 letter,
said Presser had virtually no short-term memory and added, ``I
doubt that he will possibly ever have substantial improvement from
his current status.''
   Presser was released June 13 from the Barrow Neurological
Institute in Phoenix, Ariz., where he had undergone treatment for
the brain tumors.
   He gave up his duties as president of the nation's largest union
for four months on May 4 because of poor health.
   A May 1986 indictment accused Presser of taking $700,000 from
his Cleveland local's union office and paying it to ``ghost''
employees who performed no work.

<TEXT>
   Tigrean rebels have claimed that Ethiopian
warplanes killed more than 600 civilians in air raids on an ancient
market town during the government's two-month-old counteroffensive.
   The guerrillas said Tuesday that the strikes by four MiG fighter
bombers and two Mi-24 helicopter gunships were unleashed on
Wednesday, June 22 in Hauzien, 340 miles north of Addis Ababa, the
capital.
   Wednesday is market day in Hauzien and hundreds of peasants are
traditionally drawn to the town.
   The attack wounded more than 360 people and killed hundreds of
animals, said the rebel communique, sent to The Associated Press
from the Tigre People's Liberation Front information center in
London,
   There was no way to independently verify the claim. The
government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam rarely comments on
rebel claims, and both sides often exaggerate reports on the war in
northern Ethiopia.
   The communique said much of the town was razed in a six-hour
bombardment.
   ``Most of the buildings _ over 500 including nine stores and 15
shops, the town mosque and the only school _ were completely
destroyed,'' said the rebel report.
   They claimed the Ethiopian government uses rockets and napalm,
phosphorous and cluster bombs in attacks on numerous Tigrean towns.
   Western diplomats based in Addis Ababa say they have heard of
the government using cluster bombs, but not napalm.
   ``The Dergue (government) is committing these atrocities in a
region suffering from starvation,'' the rebels said.
   The U.S. Government and diplomats from other Western countries
have condemned a government counteroffensive begun in May that has
crippled relief operations and jeopardized the lives of 3.2 million
people threatened by starvation from drought in the neighboring
provinces of Eritrea and Tigre.
   The war zone is the most severely affected by a drought that
plagues more than 7 million Ethiopians.
   But diplomats similarly accuse the rebels of pursuing military
objectives with no regard for drought victims. The rebels launched
their offensive at the end of last year after the United Nations
warned of impending famine in the region. Rebels won major
victories in March, capturing several towns and forcing government
troops to withdraw from others.
   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies when, with a clique of army
officers, he helped overthrow Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974.
   Both the government and rebels are Marxist. Eritrean
secessionists took up arms 27 years ago and are fighting Africa's
oldest civil war. Tigrean rebels went to war 14 years ago demanding
more autonomy.

<TEXT>
   Tongans plan to feast, dance, march in
parades and race longboats in a five-day party fit for a king _ and
decreed by the monarch of this South Pacific archipelago.
   King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV ordered the bash for Friday through
Tuesday to celebrate his 70th birthday on July 4.
   The capital will be shut down and the king will be honored with
a naval review, a black-tie ball, native dancing, rugby matches and
two traditional feasts each inviting 1,200 people.
   There will be church services across the islands 1,500 miles
north of New Zealand where nearly all residents are Christian.
   Tonga, discovered by Dutch explorers in 1616, is the region's
sole surviving monarchy. Tupuo has reigned for the past 23 years.
   The country is part of the British Commonwealth. Its Parliament
is loosely based on the British model but only nine of its 28
members are democratically elected as ``people's representatives.''
Nine are noblemen voted in by aristocratic families, and the rest
are appointed by the king.
   The king's brother, Prince Fatafehi Tu'ipelehake, is prime
minister.
   Generations of bloody tribal warfare ended last century when the
present king's great-great grandfather, Siaosa Tupou I, established
the throne. He freed commoners from a system of feudalism among
Tonga's 169 islands, spread over 290 square miles.
   The authorities are determined that this weekend's celebrations
will demonstrate solidarity with the monarchy. But in recent years,
there have been rumblings of discontent in this country of 104,000
people.
   Many Tongan families now find themselves relying on money sent
back from relatives who have migrated to the United States,
Australia and New Zealand.
   Tired of the constraints of a rigid class system, thousands of
young Tongans continue to migrate rather than face growing
unemployment and few opportunities at home.

<TEXT>
   An official disgraced three years ago for
alleged corruption is back in the limelight as one of Canton's
rising stars, yet another example of China's penchant for reviving
its politically dead.
   Lei Yu, 54, earned nationwide notoriety in 1985 when, official
media accounts said, he and other top-ranking officials on southern
Hainan island were accused of abusing power by importing vehicles
and consumer goods and reselling them at high profits to the rest
of China.
   Lei was demoted from his leading party and government posts on
the undeveloped, tropical island between Vietnam and the
Philippines and become a county-level party deputy secretary in
southern Guangdong province.
   But on March 31, the official Xinhua News Agency announced that
he had been promoted to vice mayor of Canton in charge of foreign
economic relations and trade. Assisting economic growth in two
counties, Lei had learned, among other things, ``never to loaf on
the job,'' the report said.
   On Monday, the Canton People's Congress voted Lei one of six
vice mayors of the Guangdong capital, a leading city in China's
economic reform program.
   He received the second most votes of the nine candidates,
newspaper reports appearing in the nearby British colony of Hong
Kong said Tuesday.
   Four days earlier, the congress chose Yang Ziyuan as mayor by a
318-153 tally over Lei, according to newspaper reports in Hong
Kong. Before the vote, Lei reportedly reminded the congress of his
mistakes in the Hainan affair in a well-received speech and threw
his support Yang.
   In an interview at Canton's municipal offices two weeks ago, it
was clear why Lei is back. He displayed an agile no-nonsense mind
and enthusiastically espoused the market-oriented economic reforms
of senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Wearing a well-tailored Western suit and exuding confidence, Lei
seemed cut in the mold of Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang, who
has taken the lead in promoting Deng's reforms.
   Deng and Zhao also have experienced disgrace and rehabilitation.
Both were purged during the chaotic 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural
Revolution, accused of being `capitalist roaders' and paraded
through the streets in dunce caps. Countless others were purged
during the decade of disaster.
   Lei's disgrace was different, however. It resulted not from a
political power struggle but from economic scandal.
   According to official Chinese reports, the scandal involved the
illegal trade of 3.3 million cars, color televisions, video
recorders and motorcycles, which were imported to Hainan island in
1984 and 1985 then resold throughout China.
   Under a program to spur development, Hainan had been allowed to
import automobiles and 16 other ``luxury goods''. The items were
intended for use only on the island, but Lei and others decided to
resell them, resulting in millions of dollars in profts, the
reports said.
   A Western source in Canton said he believed Lei thought the
importation scheme could raise money to build up Hainan's
infrastructure, which is woefully lacking. As such, many believed
Lei was punished more for his unorthodox methods than for economic
corruption.
   ``During my stay in Hainan, I wanted to boost the island's
economy,'' Lei was quoted as saying in the Xinhua report. ``But
things went contrary to my wishes because I did not take hold of
the state policies.''
   Lei reiterated during his interview with The Associated Press
that he did not get ``one cent'' out of the importation scandal.
Still he acknowledged that he let things get out of hand.
   ``At that time, we were short of experience, so it was not
strange that we sometimes made mistakes,'' he said, adding with a
smile, ``I believe I'll be a little smarter than before.''

<HEAD>Some Of Minnesota's Spring Wheat Dies Of Thirst</HEAD>

   Gerald Olsonawski plowed under all but
300 of the 1,700 acres of wheat he planted in the spring. The crop
struggled then withered on Minnesota's thirsty prairie, the upper
section of America's breadbasket.
   ``We've gone through all that work, and now the whole year is
shot,'' said Olsonawski, 39. ``It's like a wasted year. It's like
we never turned a wheel.
   ``You should see beautiful fields. All you see is black dirt.
I've given up on the grain crop,'' said Olsonawski.
   Last year, Minnesota produced about 100 million bushels of
spring wheat worth $246 million, second only to North Dakota's 189
million bushels, according to the state's Agricultural Statistics
Service. Spring wheat is the high protein variety, ground into
flour for yeast breads and hard rolls.
   This year, 85 percent of the crop is rated poor to very poor,
the state said Monday. Damage is even worse in parched Kittson
County, in the northwest corner on the Canadian border.
   County officials estimate a loss of 7 million bushels, 90
percent of the crop. Already, 60,000 acres have been plowed under.
An acre that should yield 40 to 50 bushels of wheat is projected to
produce half a bushel, according to insurance appraisers.
   Lush, solid waves of grain should be filling fields. Now, they
look like desk tops dotted with stubbly stalks and revealing bare
spots. Wheat that should be 8 to 12 inches high with grain-bearing
heads have wilted to half that size.
   ``This crop has failed,'' said Kelly Turgeon, the county's
executive for the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service. ``It's not even feasible to try to harvest it. It's
devastating.''
   A majority of the county's farmers have federal crop insurance.
They are paid damages for what their land is producing and what it
should have yielded, but the payments probably will just cover
expenses for fertilizer, fuel and time.
   For grain farmers, the nation's worst drought in 50 years was
the last straw in a hectic year. They had a killing frost May 13,
and then saw high winds blow away seeds and injure crops.
   After a farmer has invested time and money on plowing, seeding
and fertilizing, plowing a crop under is hard.
   But Harold Younggren, 61, was told his wheat harvest would be
half a bushel per acre instead of 45 to 60 bushels. He and his sons
looked at the scraggle in the arid fields, figured it would cost
more in fuel and time than it was worth, and then plowed under all
but 40 acres of the 1,550 acres of wheat they planted in late April.
   ``There wasn't anything there. There's a few spears of grain
here and there,'' Younggren said.
   ``We've never torn up grain like this before,'' said Younggren,
a farmer for 40 years. ``The heat burned it right off. It dwindled
to nothing.''
   Statewide, the picture is a little brighter, but not much.
   A 50 percent loss has been projected, amounting to $200 million
to $300 million, according to Fred Hejduk, head of the Minnesota
Wheat Growers Association in Red Lake Falls.
   ``The overall situation is very serious and almost beyond
repair,'' said Hejduk. ``Some fields are totally devastated. It
doesn't pay to crank up the combine.''
   A wheat farmer may have spent $150 an acre to plant, seed and
fertilize. That acre should return a $75 profit.
   ``Plowing it under means they've failed,'' said Bernie Penner,
conservation service agent in Crow Wing County. ``How would you
feel as a surgeon if all your patients died? A farmer's expertise
is raising crops. He only gets one chance each year.''
   Wheat is such a part of the lifestyle in the fertile grain belt
that wallpaper in offices and restaurants is decorated with wheat
stalks.
   And a drought seems incongruous in a state with a license plate
slogan of Land of 10,000 Lakes, and where the mighty Mississippi
begins.
   But hot winds and a dry spring meant grain cooked under a
sweltering sun.
   Farmers plow under their fields to control weeds, get their land
ready for next season and keep unprofitable plants from using up
nutrients.
   Some farm officials wish the farmers would just let the wheat
stay in the fields instead of risking wind erosion remindful of the
1930s Dust Bowl.
   ``We're advising them to just leave it there,'' said Marlin
Schieffert, conservation service agent in Clay County. ``It's so
dry, it's susceptible to be blown by the wind.''

<HEAD>Workers Died Trying To Save Each Other, Investigators Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A cleaning accident at a metal platings
plant unleashed deadly cyanide fumes that killed four men,
including three who collapsed trying to save co-workers, and
injured 20 others.
   The Bastian Plating Co. plant remained closed today after air
samples showed 5 parts per million of cyanide fumes near the tank
where the workers died Tuesday.
   Ten parts per million can affect the central nervous system,
causing breathing difficulties, nausea and confusion, said Trooper
Robert Corkwell, a hazardous materials officer for the state
police. A concentration of 300 parts per million is fatal, he said.
   Company officials believe a worker used muriatic acid, a
commercial term for hydrochloric acid, and zinc oxide to clean a
5-foot-tall tank when the lethal hydrocyanic acid formed, Corkwell
said. An independent lab later determined sulfides also were
present, he said.
   Investigators have not determined whether the worker used a
standard procedure that went awry, or whether the wrong chemicals
were mixed, Corkwell said.
   Craig Fogel, 19, was critically injured. Fifteen of the injured
were rescuers wearing self-contained breathing units who were
affected by the gas because it can be absorbed through the skin,
Corkwell said.
   The first worker collapsed inside the vat and three others in
succession apparently tried to pull their co-workers to safety,
police say.
   Investigators don't know who mixed the chemicals or the order in
which the victims died, Auburn police Detective David Bundy said.
   ``He might be able to tell us when he comes around,'' Bundy
said, referring Fogel, who was in critical condition at Parkview
Memorial Hospital in Fort Wayne after undergoing hyperbaric oxygen
treatment.
   Bastian Vice President Dennis Fry said he was unsure how many
workers were in the plant when the accident happened. The plant
employs about 30 people to make dyes and chromate dip used to give
electroplated products a decorative color.
   DeKalb County coroner Dr. William Hathaway identified the
victims as Baron W. Sweet, 21, of Garrett; Larry D. Hensinger, 29,
of Waterloo; William M. Freeze, 29, of Garrett; and Jeffery Link of
Auburn. Link's age was not available.
   Two other workers, Ron Alwood, 48, of Auburn and Patrick Cramer,
22, of Garrett, were listed in fair condition at Parkview Memorial.
   Sharon Cramer said her son had told her he tried unsuccessfully
to pull one of his co-workers out of the fumes. ``He was trying to
help one boy out and he lost consciousness,'' she said.
   Cramer has worked at the plant as a stacker since January, but
is determined to quit his job, she said. ``The first thing he said
to me was, `I won't work there anymore.''' Mrs. Cramer said.

   Some competitors may eat vegetables
and lift weights when they train, but Dean Houghton munches Ding
Dongs and flips channels.
   Houghton, 26, is on a strict training schedule featuring
Cheezits and a TV remote control that he hopes will make him Sonoma
County's official Great American Couch Potato.
   ``You don't want to extend yourself too much,'' said the
300-pound Houghton, who added that his mother banished him from the
family couch because he put a ``permanent slope'' in it.
   Twenty other hopefuls are vying for the title that features a
two-week job at the Sonoma County Fair next month. There, the
official sofa spud will earn $1,000 for sitting in an exhibit,
eating and watching television for 10 hours a day.
   ``It was just a crazy stunt. We were surprised anyone took it
seriously,'' said Jane Engdahl, the fair's special events
coordinator. Engdahl cooked up the coach potato contest as a way of
attracting fairgoers into otherwise routine exhibit halls.
   But the idea also attracted criticism by health food advocates
and some residents who complained that the contest would set a bad
example for children.
   County Supervisor Helen Rudee, once a registered nurse, also
criticized the event, calling it ``the dumbest thing I've ever
heard of.''
   But Engdahl said the winner, who will be selected by the fair
board, doesn't necessarily have to eat junk food. The main thing is
to lounge in a recliner, remote in hand, under the eyes of
fairgoers.
   ``The true test is if you can talk to the press and watch
professional bowling at the same time,'' Engdahl said.

<HEAD>Romania Orders Hungarian Diplomat to Leave in Escalating Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rift between two East bloc allies
grew to unprecedented proportions when Romania ordered a Hungarian
diplomat expelled in a dispute over Romania's treatment of its
ethnic Hungarians.
   Romania on Tuesday ordered Hungary's consul general in the city
of Cluj-Napoca to leave the country within 48 hours and declared
the consulate closed, the official Hungarian news agency MTI said.
   The decision apparently was prompted by a demonstration of about
50,000 Hungarians in Budapest Monday to protest the planned
demolition by the year 2000 of half of Romania's villages,
including ethnic Hungarian communities.
   It was the largest street demonstration in Hungary since Soviet
troops put down a 1956 rebellion.
   Cluj-Napoca is in Transylvania in northwestern Romania, where
most of that country's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians live.
Hungarians know it as Kolozsvar.
   Ethnic Hungarians in Romania, the largest minority group in East
Europe outside the Soviet Union, long have complained that they
suffer discrimination and are denied ethnic rights.
   Romania and Hungary, neighbors and military allies in the
Soviet-led Warsaw pact, have waged a war of words over the issue.
   Official Hungarian media have given considerable coverage to
protests by political, social and artistic groups against Romania's
village demolition program.
   President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania on Tuesday rejected
criticism of the plan and accused Hungarian authorities of actively
supporting the unofficial protest.
   The resettlement plan calls for 7,000 of Romania's 13,000
villages to be torn down and replaced with agricultural-industrial
centers.
   Romanian state-run media said the goal is to gain more farmland
for use by the country's collectivized agriculture, which is
plagued by lack of incentives for farmers and livestock fodder
shortages.
   Romania also maintains the plan will raise the living standards
of villagers who would have access to health care and social
facilities.
   MTI said Foreign Minister Ioan Totu of Romania summoned
Hungarian Ambassador Pal Szuecs Tuesday and told him of the
expulsion order.
   ``All responsibility for this violation of the valid consulate
agreement between Hungary and Romania devolves upon the Romanian
government,'' MIT said. It said the Hungarian government would work
to improve relations with Romania and the 20,000 ethnic Romanians
in Hungary.
   Hungary has given refuge to thousands of ethnic Hungarians who
have fled Romania and also taken in other Romanians escaping
economic hardship.
   Romania began an austerity program in 1981 that has led to food
and energy shortages. It has reduced its foreign debt from more
than $11 billion in 1981 to less than $5 billion, but at the
expense of its people.
   Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Ministry spokesman Istvan
Komoroczky told journalists that Hungarian authorities had told the
Romanian Embassy in advance of Monday's demonstration.
   The demonstrators marched silently past the Romanian embassy
building, which was guarded by Hungarian police, and there were no
incidents.
   The Hungarian government and speakers at Monday's rally stressed
that a change of existing borders is out of the question. Under the
1920 Trianon Treaty, predominantly Hungarian Transylvania became
part of Romania.

<TEXT>
   Democrats are trying to figure out how to get
35,000 people slated to attend the party's national convention into
a hall that will seat only 11,000 people.
   The Democratic National Convention Committee is hoping to
peacefully resolve the problem by putting the overflow from the
Omni Coliseum into the adjacent World Congress Center, but admit
the feelings of party hotshots may be hurt in the process.
   ``We'll have fewer spectator seats in the Omni, and there are
going to be people who are disappointed they aren't going to be in
the Omni,'' said Ruth Berry, press secretary for the DNCC, which is
in charge of organizing the July 18-21 event.
   The seating problem is one of a series of difficulties in
preparations for the nominating convention, but officials are
certain all will be right when the opening gavel sounds.
   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk said, ``We knew there
would be limited space. But it is adequate to accommodate all the
delegates and additional guests. It will be a little difficult for
the media. This is not a sprawling complex (The Omni), but it's not
a theater in the round.''

   The Michigan House Elections Committee has
voted to reinstate a presidential primary election in 1992.
   Under the bill passed Tuesday to the full House, voters would
have to declare in advance whether they wanted to vote on the
Republican or Democratic side.
   The provision was added by lawmakers to meet the Democratic
National Committee rules which don't recognize results of ``open
primaries'' allowing members of each party to cross over and vote
for another party's candidate.
   In Michigan, the 1976 primary marked the last time that both
major parties participated in the open primary. The Republicans had
a primary in 1980 but opted for a multi-tiered convention system in
the past two elections.
   Leaders of both parties have supported the return to a primary.

<TEXT>
   Bernhard Goetz's six-month jail sentence was
declared illegal by an appeals court, which ordered that he be
resentenced for criminal possession of a gun in the 1984 subway
shootings of four teen-agers.
   The state Supreme Court's Appellate Division voted 5-0 on
Tuesday to vacate the jail sentence Justice Stephen Crane imposed
on Goetz on Oct. 19, 1987, after he was convicted of third-degree
criminal possession of a weapon.
   The appeals court let stand the $5,000 fine, 280 hours of
community service, five years' probation and psychiatric counseling
for Goetz ordered by Crane.
   Goetz, a 40-year-old electronics specialist, was acquitted last
June of all but the gun charge in the Dec. 22, 1984, shootings.
Goetz, who is white, said he shot the four blacks after they tried
to rob him. The youths claimed they were just panhandling money.
The case stirred a national debate about vigilantism.
   Defense attorneys said they were pleased the sentence had been
rejected but would appeal other issues to the Court of Appeals, the
state's highest court.
   ``We will be asking the judge at this point to grant Bernie
Goetz the right of probation,'' defense lawyer Barry Slotnick said.
   ``Hopefully,'' he added, ``the public will write some letters of
indignation to Judge Crane indicating that Bernie Goetz doesn't
belong in jail, whether it be for one day, two months or six
months.''
   Slotnick said Goetz cannot come out worse-off under resentencing
by Crane, scheduled for July 18.
   The prosecution and the defense contended that the punishment
was illegal and that Goetz should have been sentenced to a year in
prison.
   The defense wanted a year sentence because that would have made
Goetz eligible for release after two months. Under the six-month
sentence, he would not have been eligible for parole until four
months because of a quirk in the law.
   The prosecution argued that the law mandated a minimum sentence
of one year for third-degree criminal possession of a weapon.
   The appeals court judges agreed in part with the prosecutor,
Assistant District Attorney Gregory Waples.
   ``An individual who is convicted of this offense must be
sentenced to an indeterminate period of imprisonment, or in the
alternative, a definite sentence of no less than one year,'' the
judges said.
   Crane could have imposed a shorter legal sentence if he had
explained why the sentence required by law ``would be unduly
harsh,'' the judges wrote.
   ``Since the court expressly stated on the record that a definite
one-year term or an indeterminate term would not be unduly harsh,
the split sentence was unauthorized and illegal,'' the judges said
in an unsigned three-page opinion.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry said its high
command was meeting with army officers to discuss potential actions
once a truce with Nicaraguan rebels expires Thursday night.
   The end of the government-declared truce coincides with a series
of consulations between Secretary of State George Shultz and U.S.
allies in Central America.
   The ministry called the meetings between Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega and his commanders ``extremely important,'' but
provided no details. It said such meetings were held only in
extraordinary circumstances.
   The Sandinista government did not announce whether it would
extend its unilateral truce. The U.S.-supported Contra rebels said
they would continue to abide by the cease-fire indefinitely, but
rejected a government offer to resume peace talks this week.
   Each side has accused the other of violating the truce that took
effect March 21. The government claims 3,000 Contra fighters
recently re-entered Nicaragua from Honduran base camps in
anticipation of renewed fighting.
   A series of peace negotiations broke down June 9 over
differences on democratic reforms and a timetable for rebel
disarmament.
   The United States has funded the Contras since 1981, two years
after the Sandinistas took power, but Congress cut off military aid
to the rebels in February.
   The 6{-year war has killed more than 26,000 people and caused an
estimated $3 billion in economic damages.
   Shultz arrives today in Guatemala City and is to consult with
officials in Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador before the trip
ends Friday.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Up Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar and share prices scored strong gains in
mixed trading in Tokyo Wednesday.
   The dollar opened the day's dealings at 132.80 yen and managed
to break past the 133-yen barrier during the morning session. It
fluctuated mainly between 132.40-133.40 yen during the day before
closing at 132.40 yen, up 1.45 yen from Tuesday's 130.95-yen finish.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a slight 36.92-point loser Tuesday, won back
209.24 points, or 0.76 percent. It finished the day at 27,607.33
points.
   Traders attributed the climb to strong buying interest centered
on large-capital steels and heavy industrials which also led the
market recovery Tuesday after heavy morning losses.
   Traders said the dollar's bullish rise was fueled by comments
from Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who ruled out the
possibility of foreign exchange intervention by the Bank of Japan
to support the yen.
   ``The statement prompted a lot of dollar-buying,'' said a dealer
at a local securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``As long as the central bank continues with this attitude, the
dollar may even rise to the 135-yen level this week,'' he said.
   Miyazawa told reporters during a regular press conference on
Tuesday that the central bank had no intention of intervening in
the market to stem the dollar's rise unless necessary. He dismissed
the current market gyrations as ordinary fluctuations.
   The dealer also said intervention in Europe, where the business
day begins as Tokyo trading ends, had cast a slight worry on the
local market Tuesday. The dollar had dropped a slight 0.75 yen to
finish at 130.95 yen Tuesday, down from Monday's six-month high of
131.70 yen.
   The U.S. currency last traded on the 133-yen level in early
December when it opened at 133.05 yen on Dec. 8. The dollar closed
last Friday at 129.70 yen, a four-month high.

   Pale and tired, Anwara Begum was
frying grains of wheat while her two small sons hovered around her
makeshift little stove in a relief center for hundreds of flood
victims set up at a school.
   ``Mummy, we are hungry. Give us food,'' one of the naked little
boys cried.
   Their father, 45-year Sanu Miah, stood by helplessly, tears
welling in his eyes and running down his wrinkled cheeks.
   ``We have had very little to eat since floods destroyed my
house,'' he told a visiting reporter Tuesday. ``The children are in
especially terrible condition.''
   His wife Anwara had fashioned a primitive stove from an empty
powdered milk can. Her children, about 6 and 8, were so hungry she
had not taken time to grind her grains of wheat into flour.
   Miah, clad in a torn sarong, was among 500 people who sought
shelter at the at the Syed Saiduddin High School after
monsoon-swollen rivers surged through villages and fields around
Noapara, little more than a railway stop on the train line from
Dhaka, the capital, to Sylhet, 200 miles to the northeast.
   An estimated 1.3 million people _ more than 10 percent of
Bangladesh's population of 105 million _ have been stranded or
displaced by floods.
   In the past week, at least 39 people have died in this country
shredded by hundreds of rivers that surge over their banks every
year when the monsoon rains come. About half the deaths were in the
Sylhet area.
   In Noapara, about 95 miles northeast of Dhaka, the Syed
Saiduddin school has suspended classes to offer shelter to people
whose homes were washed away or damaged by the floods.
   A few blocks from the school are the remains of the railroad
bridge that was swept away on Sunday, making Noapara the last stop
for travelers from Dhaka trying to reach nearby Sylhet, the
commercial center of Dhaka's tea-growing district.
   Roads throughout Sylhet and the surrounding districts of
Sunamganj and Moulvibazar in the far northeastern corner of
Bangladesh were also washed out or still under water.
   Miah, who owns no land and hires himself out as an unskilled
laborer from day to day, does not know what he will do next. He has
not decided whether to try to rebuild his house in Rasulpur
village, seven miles east of Noapara, or to seek a new life
elsewhere.
   He said the flash floods arrived with a loud bang and swirled
waist-high through his mud and straw house.
   But his neighbor, 55-year-old Muzaffar Ali, has decided to
return home and try again. Noapara is a hilly area, where flash
floods cascade through the villages and fields and quickly recede
as the water surges downstream.
   The refugees said thousands of mud and straw houses had
disappeared in the flood.
   ``I am leaving the camp since water is no more there (in
Rasulpur),'' Ali said, surrounded by his frail, 40-year-old wife
and their three sons and two daughters.
   ``What shall I eat and what shall I gather for my children?'' he
asked, a vacant look on his face. ``I have no land to till, even.''
   Still, the people around Noapara appear to have been luckier
than countrymen in low-lying areas. Rivers continue to rise in
flatter areas in the interior of the Sylhet and Sunamganj districts.
   News reports in Dhaka say at least 800,000 people have been
stranded by flooding in the Sunamganj district alone.
   The floods, coupled with communication and transportation links
that are erratic even in dry weather in Bangladesh, hamper relief
efforts.
   In Noapara, some private citizens and organizations have tried
to provide relief, according to Mohammad Ali, a shopkeeper at the
train station. No local government officials could be located for
comment on the situation when a reporter from Dhaka visited Noapara.
   In Dhaka, officials said earlier in the week that tens of
thousands of people, perhaps more, have taken refuge in government
relief centers.
   But the task is daunting. Bangladesh, with a per capita income
of about $150 a year, is one of the world's poorest nations. Last
year more than 1,200 people died in floods.
   In 1985 more than 10,000 people died in hurricanes and tidal
waves that swept over low islands in the Bay of Bengal on the
country's south coast.

   A mysterious hearing-impaired boy
found walking the streets of this border city nearly eight months
ago is finally going home after a tearful reunion with his mother.
   ``He's very excited, and he has already packed his things and is
ready to go,'' Olivia Espinosa Bermudez, director of a child
welfare agency here, said following Tuesday night's reunion between
the boy, known to the world as Sabath, and his mother.
   Authorities said it would take three days to officially confirm
through medical records that the little boy is 9-year-old Jose de
Jesus Garcia Aguilera, but said he and Micaela Aguilera de Garcia
appeared to be mother and son.
   Ms. Aguilera said she plans to take the boy back to his Gulf
Coast hometown of Tampico, Mexico, where his grandmother and four
siblings live.
   However, she said she might later send Jose back to the child
welfare agency, where he has been staying the past seven months, so
he can learn to speak and use sign language.
   ``I work, and if I take him, he'll run away again,'' Ms.
Aguilera, 32, told reporters as she hugged the teary-eyed boy
nicknamed Chuy. ``I know that (here) my boy is safe because he's
been here all this time.''
   She said she might allow a Juarez couple to adopt her boy, ``but
just if they give mepermission to see him.''
   Ms. Aguilera has described Jose as a chronic runaway, and said
he last ran away while visiting his father in October in Monterrey,
750 miles southeast of Juarez.
   He was found Nov. 7 roaming the streets of Juarez, across the
Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas.
   Workers at the welfare agency, the center for the Development of
the Integrated Family, were stumped as to the boy's origins because
he can only speak a few words and communicates mostly through
gestures and drawings. They named him Sabath because he was found
on a Saturday _ sabado in Spanish.
   Reporters on Tuesday night watched as mother and son
communicated through an impromptu sign language Ms. Aguilera
obviously was familiar with. The boy is deaf in his right ear and
has some hearing in the other.
   ``Why do I think this is my son?'' Ms. Aguilera asked. ``Because
of his scars _ on his leg, his head and his left arm.''
   She pointed to a scar below Jose's left knee and said it was
from a dog bite. ``Bad dog,'' she said in English. ``Bad dog,'' the
boy answered in a deep voice, and the two laughed and hugged.
   Just before their first reunion earlier in the day, Jose was
shown pictures of his mother and grandmother and immediately
recognized them, said Mrs. Bermudez.
   When Ms. Aguilera was brought into the room, ``he just ran and
saw her and cried, but he was happy,'' Mrs. Bermudez said.
   Ms. Aguilera was accompanied to Juarez with her sister, Marta
Lorena Aguilar Paredes, and an El Paso Times reporter who found the
family in Tampico. The reporter went there last week after learning
that a woman there had reported a missing son matching the boy's
description.
   The Times paid for a chartered flight to the El Paso area
Tuesday. The newspaper offered to fly the family back, but Ms.
Aguilera said she would prefer to take a bus, said Publisher Tom
Fenton.
   The search for the boy's origins extended into the United States
and even France after child welfare agency workers noticed the boy
preferred U.S. food and cartoon characters. They notified their
Texan counterparts, and the FBI got in on the case.
   Some of Jose's drawings seemed to indicate he had survived a
plane crash, but those drawings now seem to be the work of an
active imagination. The family lives near the Tampico airport, and
social workers said Jose seemed attracted to airplanes and the
Juarez airport.

<HEAD>Justice Employees File Suit Against Random Drug Testing Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trial attorneys and supervisors in the Justice
Department are asking a court to halt Attorney General Edwin Meese
III's plan to conduct random drug testing of department officials.
   A lawsuit was filed by 42 employees on Tuesday, a day after the
Justice Department announced random testing of workers in sensitive
jobs would begin in two months.
   The suit contends the plan is unconstitutional and is being
implemented ``without any factual showing of a problem of drug use
in the department.''
   The 42 plaintiffs named in the suit were mostly Justice
Department trial attorneys plus several supervisors, including
three deputy chiefs of the civil rights division's criminal
section: Barry Kowalski, Daniel L. Bell and Norajean M. Flanagan.
   Arthur Spitzer, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney
involved in the case, said he had spoken to a number of other
Justice Department officials who privately supported the lawsuit
but didn't want to join it for fear of hurting their careers.

<HEAD>House Approves Bill To Crack Down on Telemarketing Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is calling on the Federal Trade
Commission to crack down on fraud in telemarketing _ sales over the
telephone _ which is estimated to cost consumers at least $1
billion a year.
   By a voice vote, the House passed a measure on Tuesday directing
the FTC to draft rules governing sales by telephone and to make it
easier to sue telemarketing companies.
   The bill says the agency should consider including provisions
that establish refund rights for customers and a period during
which consumers can withdraw their order and set a time of day when
unsolicited calls can be made.
   The FTC estimates that telemarketing sales in 1986 amounted to
more than $100 billion. The agency, however, has been able to get
back only about $25 million for defrauded consumers over the past
four years, Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said.
   ``No piece of legislation is going to end fraud,'' Luken said
during debate on the bill Monday. ``But I think this bill will
significantly reduce the losses now being suffered by American
consumers.''

<HEAD>House Approves Fishing Vessel Safety Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three years after Peggy and Robert Barry lost
their son at sea, the House has passed a measure calling for safety
equipment aboard fishing vessels that the couple says could have
helped save their son's life.
   The legislation passed Tuesday calls for safety equipment such
as life rafts and survival suits aboard the vessels. Northwest
lawmakers who fought for the bill called it a memorial to those who
have lost their lives at sea.
   ``This was an important first-step in making the industry
safer,'' said Robert Barry, who lobbied for the bill after his son
died when the fishing vessel Western Sea sank off the Alaska coast
in 1985.
   Barry, who lives in Washington, D.C., said the 70-year-old
Western Sea, which was registered out of Seattle, did not contain
life rafts, survival suits or an emergency locator when it went
down with six crewmen aboard.
   ``The crew of the Western Sea would have had a chance of
surviving if they had had such things as life rafts,'' said Barry.
``Without them, they didn't have a chance.''

   A federal racketeering lawsuit accusing
Teamsters leaders of making a ``devil's pact'' with the Mafia is a
``shameful attempt'' at union-busting, Teamsters officials charged.
   Federal prosecutors filed the civil lawsuit against the 1.6
million-member union Tuesday, seeking to oust members of the
Teamsters general executive board for allegedly allowing mob
infiltration during the past 30 years.
   The lawsuit also sought appointment of a union trustee to ensure
free and fair union elections.
   ``We are not seeking overall control of the Teamsters union,''
U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said, adding that his office was
using the racketeering laws ``in a surgical way to attempt to take
back from the Mafia the Teamsters union.''
   William Doran, head of criminal division for the FBI's New York
office cautioned: ``This is not a case of union-busting but instead
a case of mob-busting.''
   But Teamsters leaders quickly denounced the lawsuit.
   ``It's pure myth that this organization is in any way influenced
or controlled by organized crime,'' Teamsters' lawyer John Climaco
told a news conference in Montreal, where the union's general
executive board is holding its quarterly meeting.
   ``It's totally un-American and it's wrong.''
   The union's acting president, Weldon Mathis, called the lawsuit
``a vicious anti-labor attack'' and ``a shameful attempt to destroy
a democratic union. It will not be tolerated.''
   The lawsuit also was denounced on Capitol Hill, where Sen. Orrin
Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, said it sets ``a terrible precedent.''
   ``If there are union officers who are corrupt or are connected
with the Mafia, then the government should come down on them with
dispatch,'' Hatch, R-Utah, said in a speech on the Senate floor.
``But I have great difficulty in the trusteeship of an entire
international union. I don't think the government or any court in
this nation is capable of being a trustee over a union.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., echoed Hatch's remarks. ``I think we're
getting on very, very thin ice here,'' he said.
   Two years ago, the government used a similar lawsuit to place
Teamsters Local 560 in Union City, N.J., under the control of a
court-appointed trustee.
   The former head of that local called the current lawsuit a
groundless attempt by the Reagan administration to break the
American labor movement.
   ``They want to cripple the Teamsters like 560. I don't think
they'll be successful,'' said Michael Sciarra, president of the
9,000-member local from December 1984 to June 1986.
   ``It's a dark day for labor,'' he said. ``I believe the
Republicans are out and they're looking for jobs for their friends.
It's all political. They always go after the strongest.''
   Dave Beck, who preceded Jimmy Hoffa as Teamsters president from
1952-57, said if there is corruption in the union it has ``no
influence over the great mass of the Teamster organization.''
   Beck, 94, now living in Seattle, denied the allegations of
pervasive corruption in the union.
   ``I don't think there's any merit to that at all and if so
there's been a terrific amount of inefficiency by the factors of
government from the national level clear on down,'' said Beck, who
served 2{ years in prison for embezzlement.

<HEAD>English Language Listed As Among Filipinos' Liabilities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The English language diminishes
nationalism among Filipinos and tends to turn them into stammering,
second-rate people, says a committee ordered by the Senate to list
the qualities of Filipinos.
   The committee's report says a colonial mentality, selfishness,
lack of discipline, lack of initiative and lack of self-analysis
are major weaknesses of Filipinos.
   It says some of these traits are extremes of Filipinos' better
qualities, which include caring for others, strong family ties,
humor, religiosity, industry and adaptability.
   The report, released Tuesday, was prepared by social scientists
from the University of the Philippines and the Jesuit-run Ateneo
University. It blames some of the country's ills on the country's
colonial past.
   The islands were ruled by Spain for more than 300 years until
the United States took over in 1898. The Americans, through a
public education system patterned after their own, imparted to
Filipinos the English language.
   But the report says the use of English in this country of more
than 7,000 islands and about 80 indigenous languages and dialects
has caused more harm than good.
   English as the medium of education has ``de-Filipinized'' the
youth and taught them to regard American culture as superior, the
report says.
   ``Thinking in our native language but expressing ourselves in
English results not only in a lack of confidence but also in a lack
of power of expression, imprecision and stunted development of
one's intellectual powers. ``We ought to use Filipino in our
cultural and intellectual life,'' and Filipino should be the medium
of instruction in all levels of education, the report adds.
   Filipino, or Tagalog, now is the medium of instruction in grade
school and part of high school, but English remains the main medium
in college.
   At the prodding of Sen. Leticia Ramos Shahani, the 23-member
Senate directed its committees on education and social justice last
September to conduct a study on ways of arresting Philippine
society's ``moral decay.''
   It said in a resolution that despite hopes of change immediately
after the February 1986 ``People Power Revolution'' that sent
President Ferdinand Marcos into exile, graft and corruption,
nepotism, lack of patriotism, passivity and increasing crime
continue to plague society.
   ``These social ills, instead of being mere memories from the
past, seem to have become even more ingrained in the character of
the Filipino so much so that many ... have commented that the
problem has become endemic,'' the resolution said.
   Mrs. Shahani said that the report, entitled ``A Moral Recovery
Program: Building a People _ Building a Nation,'' was the result of
nine months of research, including a nationwide survey of 2,000
people.
   ``Philippine society right now is sick,'' Mrs. Shahani said.
``We are a society in crisis. There are so many silent emergencies
happening.''
   The report says Filipinos' desire to put family ahead of the
common good is often the root of corruption and abuse of economic
and political power.
   And it says Filipinos depend too much on authority and generally
do not move until told what to do.
   ``Filipinos tend to be complacent and there rarely is a sense of
urgency about any problem,'' the report goes on. ``There is a high
tolerance for inefficiency, poor service, and even violations of
one's basic rights.
   ``In many ways it can be said that the Filipino is too patient
... too easily resigned to his fate. Filipinos are thus easily
oppressed and exploited.''
   The report says one way of solving the slide in morality is for
both government and business leaders to ``be models of the positive
traits of the Filipino.''
   It suggests public and private offices organize ``national
reflection weekends'' and encourage employees to attend them
voluntarily.
   On the problem of colonial mentality, it says the country's
history must be taught ``from our perspective'' and the government
should embark on education programs to instill patriotism and
national pride.

   Residents are flocking to the levee these
days to watch as the mighty Mississippi River slowly dries up.
   ``I've lived here all my life and I've never seen anything like
this,'' J.C. Bailey, a 66-year-old carpenter said Tuesday evening
as he gazed at the shrinking river.
   Bailey and his wife, Letha, were among about 200 people who had
gathered at John Edgar Point, just below downtown, to gawk.
   ``It's amazing,'' Bailey said as he surveyed the crowd. ``My
wife and I come here all the time to watch the barges. Usually,
we're the only ones here, but this time I had a hard time just
finding a place to park.''
   Like many of the gawkers, Vernon Reed brought along binoculars
and a camera.
   He pointed to a large sandbar in the middle of the river and
said, ``That sandbar wasn't there until three weeks ago. Now, it's
100 yards long and getting bigger every day.''
   Reed, a dentistry school professor, said he has been watching
the river daily for the past three weeks or so.
   ``The river has been dropping almost a half a foot a day,'' he
said. ``You can almost see it drying up right before your eyes.''
   According to the U.S. Corps of Engineers, the Mississippi is at
a record low. The water level at Memphis is 9.8 feet below sea
level, more than 20 feet lower than it was at this time a year ago.
   ``People are starting to find artifacts and other things that
have been under water for years,'' said Dorothy Gross, a
camera-toting Memphis bookkeeper. ``A woman recently found a fossil
on the riverbank that turned out to be a mastodon bone.''
   She and the others in the crowd watched intently as an Ultra
Light aircraft suddenly swooped down and landed on the newly formed
sandbar in the middle of the river. The on-lookers oohed and ahhed
as the craft paused on the sandbar for a moment and then took off,
looking like a huge dragonfly as it hovered just a few feet above
the water.
   An almost festive mood prevailed as the crowd combed the bank
for souvenirs or peered across the water, trying to spot a trace of
a sunken wreck purported to have been sighted on the Arkansas side
of the river.
   ``It's supposed to be over there, on the far side of the
sandbar,'' said Billie Ann Owen, who came down to look at the river
with her husband and 2-year-old son.
   ``I'm here to make sure they don't fall in,'' she said, laughing.
   James Owen, an insurance agent, said he was hoping to find an
artifact to commemorate the visit.
   ``Like everybody else here I'd be happy to go home with a belt
buckle or an arrowhead, something that hasn't been seen for a
couple of hundred years,'' he said.
   Owen added that he had come to the river to view history in the
making.
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' he said. ``Or, at least
I hope it is.''

   Hours after Mikhail S. Gorbachev said citizens
should be able to freely express their opinions, police broke up
two demonstrations in Moscow in a scene reminiscent of traditional
Soviet intolerance.
   ``Homeland'' was what protesters shouted Tuesday as 200 Crimean
Tatars gathered to demand they be allowed to return to their
homeland.
   Police moved in twice to drag off members of the disgruntled
ethnic group, carting them away in buses.
   On Pushkin Square, police arrested seven members of a group
called the Democratic Union, witnesses said. The group advocates a
multiparty system and an end to the Soviet military presence in
Eastern Europe.
   Today, participants in the demonstrations said the seven had
either been fined, jailed or summoned to court. The fate of the
arrested Tatars was unknown.
   In the Kremlin on Tuesday, Gorbachev told the first nationwide
Communist Party conference in 47 years that the civil rights of
Soviet citizes need to be better respected.
   ``I would like to dwell particularly on the political freedoms
that enable a person to express his opinion on any matter,'' he
said in his keynote address. ``The implementation of these freedoms
is a real guarantee that any problem of public interest will be
discussed from every angle.''
   But the Soviet leader warned that activities such as redrawing
borders and establishing political parties to challenge the
Communists' political monopoly would not be tolerated.
   He also said the Soviet legal system should ``guarantee strict
observance of the citizens' rights to the inviolability of private
life and the home, privacy of correspondence, postal and telegraph
messages.''
   The system must also ensure, he said, that a person is innocent
until proven guilty and that all people get equal treatment before
the law.
   Those rights and the right to speak out on the issues before
Soviet society have been violated since the time of dictator Josef
Stalin and must be restored, he said.
   After police carried away about 200 demonstrating Crimean Tatars
on Tuesday, a sobbing woman said: ``They took my husband!''
   The woman, in her 20s, was arrested a few minutes later.
   Two officers told a reporter the protesters were not being
arrested or taken to a jail, but merely removed from the area
because they were ``violating public order.''
   Stalin ordered all Crimean Tatars deported to Soviet Asia in May
1944 from their homes in the Ukraine. They were accused of
betraying their country while the Crimean peninsula was occupied by
the Nazis.
   The government dropped the collective war crimes charges in
1967, but the Crimean Tatars, who number about 300,000, were not
allowed to return home.
   On Pushkin Square, after police rounded up members of the
Democratic Union, several remaining group members addressed
separate crowds to promote their platform.
   Yevgenia Debrianskaya, a group member, said today that two of
those arrested were ordered jailed for 15 days, two were imprisoned
for 10 days and two were summoned to court in a few days. She said
she was fined $161.
   In addition, a leading Democratic Union member was arrested
Monday and sentenced to 15 days in jail for taking part in an
earlier demonstration, a spokesman for the group said Tuesday.
   Yuri Mityunov said the arrest of Igor Tsarkov was aimed at
keeping the group quiet during the party conference.
   Reshat Dzhemilev, a Crimean Tatar who lives in the Uzbekistan
capital of Tashkent, said today that he did not know what became of
countrymen arrested during Tuesday's protest.
   Moscow dissident Valery Senderov said that in previous cases,
the Tatars have been shipped home from Moscow and no legal action
taken against them.
   Dzhemilev said Crimean Tatars met Tuesday in Tashkent and
decided to strike at their workplaces after a reported
demonstration in the city by about 5,000 Tatars on Sunday.

   Self-esteem got no respect, at least not
in Contra Costa County.
   Opponents of a proposed self-esteem task force, saying it would
undermine traditional values, persuaded the county Board of
Supervisors to reject such a committee Tuesday.
   Forty-two of California's counties have gone along with a state
measure calling for the formation of self-esteem task forces, but
Contra Costa County supervisors vetoed the idea, expressing
reservations about the ``definition'' of self-esteem as well as
finding the money for another committee.
   Supporters of the plan said a lack of self-esteem leads to a
range of ills, from runaway children to crime. But opponents said
the task force undermines religious and family values.

<HEAD>Government Announces Release Of 46 Dissidents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced today the
release of 46 political prisoners, including prominent dissident
Kim Kun-tae, and said it would review the cases of other jailed
radicals.
   The Justice Ministry, in a brief statement, said the 46 would be
released Thursday from various prisons on parole. Ministry
officials said 453 common criminals would also be paroled.
   Opposition groups have been demanding the release of hundreds of
jailed dissidents they contend were imprisoned for political
beliefs or anti-government activity.
   Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung told the National Assembly
today that more than 600 political prisoners remain in jail. He
called the continued detention of dissidents the main barrier to
political peace in South Korea.
   ``How can we talk about reconciliation and political development
while keeping in prison those patriots, numbering more than 600,
who fought for democracy?'' he said.
   About 20 relatives of political prisoners demonstrated earlier
today outside the headquarters of the governing Democratic Justice
Party to demand release of all prisoners. They were taken away by
police and released a short time later.
   Some opposition groups contend there are more than 1,000
political prisoners serving sentences or awaiting trial for
anti-government activity. Government officials say most of the
prisoners committed violent crimes or violated national security
laws.
   The dissidents to be released Thursday either demonstrated
repentence or served a third of their sentences, ministry officials
said. They said the cases of other dissidents will be reviewed on a
monthly basis for possible releases.
   Kim Kun-tae appeared to be the only prominent figure among those
to be released Thursday.
   Sentenced in 1986 to five years in prison for inciting unrest,
he recently received the Robert F. Kennedy award for human rights
and international human rights groups have been campaigning for his
release.
   Kim Dong-chul, a senior Justice Ministry official, said Kim
Kun-tae had demonstrated repentence because he told officials he
would continue his political activities, but would follow the law.
   Among those to be released are five people arrested in December
after opposition supporters staged a demonstration in Seoul over
alleged government vote rigging in presidential elections.
   Five labor activists and a number of members of a radical
student group are among the other dissidents, officials said.
   Also to be released are six men, former Korean residents of
Japan, who were convicted of spying for communist North Korea, the
officials said.
   Hundreds of political prisoners have been released in several
amnesties since last summer after the government of former
President Chun Doo-hwan bowed to demands for democratic reforms.
   President Roh Tae-woo said today in a speech to government and
governing party officials that his administration has made
considerable progress toward achieving full democracy. He said
there had been a dramatic improvement in political and human rights.
   Roh, a former general, backed opposition demands for direct
elections and democratic reforms exactly one year ago after
nationwide unrest. He won election in December after two opposition
candidates split the opposition vote.

   The dollar soared past the 133-yen mark today for
the first time in nearly seven months before falling back in active
trading in Tokyo. Share prices on the stock exchange also scored
heavy gains.
   The dollar closed the day at 132.40 yen, up 1.45 yen from its
130.95 yen finish on Tuesday. It broke the 133-yen level during the
morning session and briefly peaked at 133.40 yen before falling
back. The currency fluctuated mostly between 132.40-133.40 yen.
   ``It was a carbon copy of what happened yesterday (Tuesday),''
said King Ogino, a dealer at Goldman Sachs.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, during a regular news
conference Tuesday, ruled out the possibility that the Bank of
Japan would intervene in the market to prop up the yen.
   Ogino said the governor of the Bank of Japan, Satoshi Sumita,
also pushed the dollar up when he said the bank would not change
its monetary policy for now but would act ``flexibly'' if
necessary. He told reporters it was unlikely the dollar would
appreciate.
   ``The market moved up and down like a yoyo,'' Ogino said. Unless
the Bank of Japan is ready to step in, he said, currency dealers
were likely to test new highs.
   ``There is spare room for the dollar to go up,'' Ogino said.
   The U.S. currency last traded at the 133-yen level in early
December when it opened at 133.05 yen on Dec. 8. It closed that day
at 132.78 yen. Just last Friday, the dollar finished the week at
129.70 yen, its highest level in about four months.
   With Wednesday's gain, the U.S. currency has won back 3.45 yen
so far this week in two trading days. On Tuesday, it fell a slight
0.75 yen.
   The yen was trading as high as 242 to the dollar in September
1985 when the major industrial nations agreed to push the dollar
lower to help reduce the massive U.S. trade deficit, including its
large deficit with Japan. A lower dollar theoretically makes U.S.
goods cheaper and more competitive abroad.
   Meanwhile, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the main market
barometer surged 209.24 points, or 0.76 percent, to close the day
at 27,607.33 points.
   Traders said steel issues led the Nikkei climb, but buying
interest also focused on heavy industrials and electricals.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 2.5 billion shares,
unchanged from Tuesday's figure.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Potential Way to Predict Breast Cancer Relapse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study that found cancerous cells in the bone
marrow of a third of women undergoing breast cancer surgery may
help lead to identifying women at risk for relapse after the
surgery, a scientist says.
   The cells eluded detection by normal marrow examination, but
they were found with a new method for seeking them out, said Alan
Houghton of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
   Women who have had breast tumors removed can get a recurrence of
cancer if cancerous cells had spread from their tumors before the
surgery. About 30 percent or more of women who show no sign of
cancerous spread at the time of surgery will nonetheless get a
recurrence, the National Cancer Institute says.
   That prompted the institute to recommend last month that
follow-up therapy with hormones or cancer-killing drugs should be
considered after breast cancer surgery in women with no sign of
cancerous spread.
   Such a broad strategy may become unnecessary if a way could be
found to identify the women at risk of relapse, Houghton said
Tuesday after speaking at a symposium sponsored by the cancer
institute and the pharmaceutical firm Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.
   He cited work published recently in the American Journal of
Surgical Pathology by Richard Cote and colleagues at
Sloan-Kettering.
   They used monoclonal antibodies, a kind of protein, that can
seek out and latch onto cells from breast cancer tumors. The
technology lets a researcher spot a single cancerous cell among
100,000 normal marrow cells, Houghton said.
   Cote and colleagues tested bone marrow removed from 51 women who
were undergoing breast cancer surgery. Eighteen, or 35 percent,
showed evidence of cancer cells in their bone marrow. Standard
methods for examining marrow found none of the cells.
   Evidence of the cancerous cells in marrow appeared in six of the
22 women who had shown no standard sign that their breast cancer
had spread. Twelve of the 29 women who did show cancerous cells in
their lymph nodes, the standard indication of spread, also showed
cells in their marrow.
   The big question now, Houghton said, is how well the presence of
the cancerous cells in the marrow predicts the risk of relapse.
That must still be evaluated, he said.
   Bruce Chabner, director of institute's division of cancer
treatment, called the work significant but agreed that the
predictive value of examining marrow has yet to be assessed.
   Other studies have shown that some 30 percent to 40 percent of
patients undergoing surgery for colon cancer show tumor cells
circulating in their blood, but those patients do not all get
cancer recurrances, he said.
   Most women who undergo breast cancer surgery will get followup
treatment anyway in accordance with the cancer institute
recommendation, he said. But a predictive test may indicate who
should be treated more intensely, he said.

<HEAD>Many Avoiding Cancer Screening Tests, Federal Study Says</HEAD>

   Sixty-two percent of women age 40 or older have
never had a breast X-ray to detect cancer, including 17 percent who
have never even heard of the test, a federal survey suggests.
   Only 17 percent of women in the age group had gotten the test
during the past year, although federal authorities recommend
getting one every year or two starting at age 40, and annually
after age 50.
   The test, called a mammogram, and other cancer screening tests
are not being used enough, said Maryann Roper, acting deputy
director of the National Cancer Institute.
   She described preliminary results of the federal survey Tuesday
at a seminar sponsored by the cancer institute and the
pharmaceutical firm Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.
   The survey, which asked a variety of questions about cancer,
included interviews with 3,297 women and 2,426 men.
   Among the results:
   _ 23 percent of women 18 or older had not had a Pap smear for
detecting cervical cancer in the previous three years. The
institute says all sexually active women in that age group should
have the test annually, or less frequently at a physician's
discretion if three consecutive Pap smears showed no problem.
   _ 72 percent of women 40 or older reported having a physical
screening exam for breast cancer, a number Roper said should be
higher because the exam is easily included in a routine physical.
   The most common reasons people gave for not getting tests were
that they had not heard of them, that they felt they did not need
screening, and that they had experienced no problems that would
prompt them to get such a test.
   Screening tests are supposed to be taken before any symptoms
develop, to catch cancers early.
   Roper said researchers were surprised to find that the cost of
mammograms was rarely cited as a reason for not getting one done.
She also said the use of mammograms appeared to decline with age,
even though the risk of breast cancer increases with age.
   Screening must become more widely used to cut overall cancer
death rates in half by the year 2000, a cancer institute goal,
Roper said. For example, some 80 percent of women will have to
follow the guidelines for breast cancer screening, she said.

   Jesse Jackson says the federal government
should set aside 10 percent of all contracts for minority-owned
businesses and put a Cabinet-level administrator in charge of
enforcing affirmative action programs.
   The Democratic presidential contender, speaking Tuesday night at
the annual convention of Operation PUSH, the civil rights
organization he founded, said laws on the books to help minorities
in contracting are empty without enforcement.
   ``That's the proclamation without the emancipation,'' he said.
   Jackson, who ran second in delegates in the primaries to
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, said an enforcement official
should be ``an economic ombudsman whose job it must be, fully
staffed, to demand affirmative action in every phase of government,
every contract.''
   Meanwhile, Operation PUSH officials at the convention said they
will examine the hiring and promotion practices of at least six
companies, beginning a process that could lead to an economic
boycott unless minorities are put in management and ownership
positions.
   The Rev. Willie Barrow, PUSH executive director, said officials
have targeted firms which she claimed appear to have few blacks in
top positions and that negotiations will be launched with the
companies.
   ``Boycott is the last resort,'' she said.
   Mrs. Barrow said PUSH will examine Red Lobster restaurants,
Payless Shoesource shoe stores, Carson Pirie Scott & Co. department
stores, and Toyota automakers.
   She also said the organization would ``look into'' makers of
Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz autos, and would continue action against
Revlon cosmetics, which has been the target of a PUSH boycott.
   Spokesman for the companies were not available for comment
Tuesday night.
   Jackson has led battles for agreements with private firms in the
past in which affirmative action timetables were established. He
told reporters at the convention that he believes strongly in
negotiating with companies over hiring and promotion practices.
   ``Boycotts only occur when negotiations break down,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan to lease out state
farmland could give Soviet farmers the most control over their
produce since Josef V. Stalin forced the nation's peasants to join
collective farms nearly 60 years ago.
   In a sweeping 3{-hour televised speech Tuesday, the Soviet
leader said it was essential to extend as quickly as possible
successful experiments in leasing land to individuals or family
farming teams.
   The result, he said, would be to make the farmers the ``masters
of the land.''
   This, he suggested, would be the quickest way to ease food
shortages that he called ``the most painful and most acute problem
in the life of our society.''
   Gorbachev also proposed to spend $124 billion through 1995 to
improve the processing, storage and transportation of food.
   ``If we manage to reap, transport, store and process the harvest
promptly, and to deliver to the consumer in good time, we will
increase food production by 20 to 30 percent'' without increasing
the productivity of the land itself, he said.
   The son of a Russian peasant, Gorbachev began his political
career in an agricultural region and oversaw Soviet agriculture
from 1978 to late 1984, giving him many years of experience with
the problems of tilling land in the huge state and collective farms
created by Stalin.
   Since taking over as Soviet leader in March 1985, Gorbachev has
signaled his willingness to break down those big units as the only
way to improve supplies in a nation where meat and milk are
rationed in many regions.
   Addressing a national congress of collective farmers last March,
Gorbachev called for broader freedoms in the farming industry.
   On a collective farm, members of a cooperative jointly own farm
buildings and machinery and share in the farm's earnings. But those
organizations have dwindled in recent decades in favor of state
farms, where workers farm the land in brigades and receive a basic
wage, like employees in a factory.
   In 1970, there were 33,000 ``kolkhozes,'' or collective farms,
in the Soviet Union. By 1986, the number of such farms had dropped
to 26,300 and the number of collective farmers from 16.7 million in
1970 to 12.6 million.
   Gorbachev has tried to persuade Soviets to return to cooperative
farms, encouraging the system to provide incentives to increase
production and alleviate the chronic food shortage in the Soviet
Union.
   Now, he wants to expand a system that permits families to lease
land from their collectives and farm it themselves.
   To make the system work, however, the Soviet Union must revamp
its state pricing structure to enable people to reap a fair return
for their efforts, Gorbachev said Tuesday.
   One delegate to the conference pointed out the general
secretary's proposal to expand the leasing system is hampered by a
deeply ingrained conservatism in Soviet society.
   ``The problem ... is that our people have forgotten how to take
risks,'' said Mikhail Bronstein, a leading economist from Tartu
University in the Baltic republic of Estonia.
   He said that older people in Estonia still remember the
democracy that existed there until Soviet troops seized the three
Baltic republics in 1940.
   ``But even Estonians are reluctant to take up these land
leases,'' Bronstein said.
   Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev said Tuesday at a news
conference that food shortages cannot be eased if the ``attitude of
dependency'' on instructions and handouts continues to dominate
state farming.
   ``We must transform the countryside,'' Yakovlev said. ``The
countryside is in ruins.''
   He proposed giving state and collective farms more autonomy to
``decide themselves how and by what criteria they are ruled.''
   Farmers long have complained they are not allowed to decide
themselves how to till the land or rotate crops and are forced to
follow rules set by local or even national party bureaucrats who
know nothing about farming.
   That system was set up by Stalin, who collectivized land in a
brutal upheaval that caused a famine in which millions died in the
early 1930s. In the early 1920s, during the formative years of the
Soviet state, Vladimir I. Lenin had made the peasantry relatively
independent by allowing them to grow and sell their own produce.
   Elderly inhabitants of Moscow recall to this day how Lenin's
decision improved the food supply in the capital almost overnight.

   Disney chief Michael Eisner says he's
ready to hop into a sequel to the movie, ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit.''
   Eisner told the Los Angeles Daily in Tuesday's editions that he
would like to see Roger return by the summer of 1991.
   ``His enthusiasm has got us a little ahead of where we are,''
said Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of Disney's studio division.
``It's too early to say that one is in set or in the works (but)
we're going to try and not disappoint him.''
   ``Roger,'' a rare mix of animation and film of humans, topped
the movie charts when it opened last week.
   Noting that the movie was three years in the making, Katzenberg
suggested Tuesday that the makers, including producer Steven
Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, could use a bit of a
breather before diving into a sequel.

   A suspected member of the Basque
separatist group ETA jumped to his death today shortly after
paramilitary Civil Guard officers came to his apartment to arrest
him, authorities said.
   A statement issued by the Guizpuzcoa province governor's office
said Miguel Arrastia Aguirre, 28, died of severe head injuries
suffered in a jump from a window of an apartment building.
   The statement said Arrastia lowered himself down an internal
shaft of the building when Civil Guard officers came to his
apartment to arrest him.
   Arrastia then climbed back to the top of the building, forced
his way into an apartment and jumped out a fourth-floor window, the
statement said.
   Civil Guard Director Luis Roldan told Spanish National Radio
today that Arrastia was sought in connection with several bombings
in the area carried out on behalf of ETA, which seeks independence
from Spain for the three-province northern Basque region.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for
killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil
Guard officers.
   ETA stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque language.

<TEXT>
   The FBI warned John Gotti, reputedly
the nation's most powerful mobster, he were being hunted by Mafia
hit men, officials said in announcing the indictments of 22 people
in the restaurant rubout of a businessman.
   Federal indictments unsealed Tuesday offer a glimpse into
feuding between the Genovese and Gambino crime families.
Authorities say the indictments could cripple the New Jersey
faction of the Genovese group.
   The indictments name 22 people, including reputed Genovese
figures, construction company executives and union officials.
   Authorities had no specific information about a link between the
plot to kill Gotti, reputed boss of the Gambino family, and the
slaying of New York businessman Irwin Schiff, said Newark FBI chief
John C. McGinley.
   After Schiff was gunned down Aug. 8 over dessert at a New York
City restaurant, law enforcement officials said they believed he
had ties to the Gambino family and was killed in a dispute over
money.
   Federal authorities said Schiff was involved in up to $40
million in fraudulent loans and was the target of a criminal
investigation. Seven people have been arrested in connection with
his financial dealings.
   At a news conference to announce the indictments, state police
Superintendent Col. Clinton L. Pagano said the New Jersey Genovese
faction was fighting efforts by Gambino operatives to move into
northern New Jersey and therefore allegedly plotted to
``eliminate'' John Gotti and his brother, Gene, a reputed
high-ranking member of the Gambino family.
   In bugged conversations last year at a Hoboken restaurant, Louis
A. ``Bobby'' Manna, 59, of Jersey City, alleged head of the New
Jersey Genovese faction, and his lieutenants discussed killing the
Gottis, McGinley said.
   Also at the restaurant were Genovese associates Richard
``Bocci'' DeSciscio, 42, of Bayonne and restaurant-owner Martin
``Motts'' Casella, 71, of Secaucus, the indictment said.
   The FBI warned the Gottis of the plot last fall, and they
decided ``to use their own devices to protect themselves,''
McGinley said.
   The larger indictment contained the Gotti and Schiff charges, a
labor payoff scheme, loan-sharking and a ``large-scale horse and
sports-betting operation,'' said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr.
   A second indictment alleged that seven defendants carried out
another illegal gambling business.
   Authorities refused to discuss the details of the Gotti and
Schiff allegations.
   In raids early Tuesday, 130 state and federal law officers
searched homes and businesses in New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania and arrested 21 of the suspects, McGinley said.
   On defendant was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness and
was not immediately arrested, McGinley said.
   An attorney for Manna, Joseph Castiglia, said his client
``categorically denies the allegations.'' But Castiglia said he
would not comment further until he could read the indictment more
closely.
   DeSciscio, a close associate of John DiGilio, a reputed Genovese
soldier slain last month, was especially ``entrusted with carrying
out violent assignments for the (Genovese) enterprise,'' the
indictment said.
   DeSciscio's attorney, Larry Bronson, called the charges
``nonsense.''
   ``We know less than you know, that's how ridiculous this is,''
said Bronson, who also represented DiGilio.
   An attorney for Casella, Maureen Mantineo, did not return a
telephone message.
   Casella, Manna and DeSciscio were held without bail pending a
court hearing Friday in Newark. Bail was set at amounts between
$10,000 and $200,000 for the other defendants, said First Assistant
U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff.

including two close aides of army chief Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh,
officials said today.
   Col. Anusorn Krisanaserani said the U.S.-made UH-1 Bell
helicopter was returning to the capital late Tuesday from the
Thai-Cambodian border when it crashed just north of Bangkok's Don
Muang International Airport.
   Anusorn identified the two aides as Col. Suppachai Rodpothong
and Col. Konthee Suvannarat.
   He said preliminary investigations indicated that bad weather
conditions may have been caused the crash.
   Local newspapers quoted police as saying that the helicopter's
rotor blades struck a power line before it plunged into the canal.

<HEAD>State Says Risk Of Severe Quake Increases Slightly Near S.F. Bay
Area</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A slightly increased risk of a severe
earthquake exists in an area south of San Francisco that was jolted
by a moderate temblor this week, say state officials who also
caution against public alarm.
   California's Office of Emergency Services issued an advisory
Tuesday saying that for the next five days, the slightly increased
likelihood for continued seismic activity was possible for the
region rocked by Monday's earthquake, which scientists estimated at
between 5.0 and 5.7 on the Richter scale.
   Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, University of
California, Berkeley, and the state Division of Mines and Geology
``say that this activity could involve an earthquake as large as
6.5 Richter magnitude, although it's not probable that a quake of
this size will occur,'' the advisory said.
   It was issued to alert officials of Santa Cruz, San Benito,
Monterey and Santa Clara counties ``to maintain preparedness and
awareness measures.''
   The chance of a magnitude-6.5 quake on the San Andreas Fault
within five days ``is a very slight possibility, but we do feel it
is our responsibility to make this information public,'' Office of
Emergency Services spokesman Tom Mullins said from Sacramento.
   ``There is some some concern, although no alarm,'' said Mike
Guerin, a spokesman at the agency's office in Ontario.
   Damage from a 6.5-magnitude quake could be comparable to that
caused by the 6.2-magnitude Morgan Hill quake on April 24, 1984,
acting state geologist Brian Tucker said. That quake injured 27
people and caused $10 million in damage.
   Residents of San Jose and the San Francisco Bay area could
expect a 6.5-magnitude quake to cause ``swaying of high-rise
buildings, potentially some fires and some localized areas of more
intense damage'' to buildings, Tucker said.
   Guerin said the advisory, which isn't a prediction, was issued
because scientists believe additional stress has been placed on a
portion of the San Andreas Fault by Monday's quake, which swayed
skyscrapers in San Francisco but resulted in no reports of injuries
or serious damage.
   Monday's quake was centered on the San Andreas Fault 16 miles
south of San Jose, officials said.
   Tucker said scientists believe Monday's quake added stress to
the San Andreas in part because the section of the fault that
snapped had been relatively quiet for years and the temblor
occurred near the junction of the San Andreas and Sargent faults.
Quakes are more likely to start near fault junctions, he said.
   Quake predictions or advisories have been rare in the United
States.
   In April 1985, the USGS predicted that by Janauary 1993, an
earthquake measuring about 6 on the Richter scale is highly likely
to hit the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas, a sparsely
populated section about 130 miles southeast of the section that
ruptured Monday. The prediction remains in effect.
   In June 1985, a series of magnitude 2.5 to 4.2 quakes near San
Diego spurred the USGS to advise there was a 5 percent chance of a
magnitude 5.0 quake within five days. None occurred.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old boy who shot a playmate hid
the body beneath his bedroom closet and helped police in a weeklong
search before admitting that he accidentally killed him in an
argument, authorities said.
   ``He put his body down in the scuttle hole and then he came back
out and cleaned up the blood,'' said police Sgt. Mark Chamberlain
said Tuesday. ``He even told his mother later that he had spilled
some Kool-Aid.''
   The June 20 disappearance of Jason Daniel Powell, 10, drew
together hundreds of residents of this community of about 10,000.
Police had searched the other boy's house where Jason's body was
found, but were unaware of the crawl space beneath the flooring.
   ``At the time we were searching with the idea that he was still
alive somewhere. We thought maybe he was hiding out and that his
friends were protecting him,'' Chamberlain said. ``We were looking
for a boy, not a body.''
   The youth moved his friend's bicycle to a field two blocks away
from his home and joined in searches in the area, Chamberlain said.
   The search ended Monday when Carol Cade found Jason's badly
decomposed body beneath a closet in her home after smelling a
stench.
   After the discovery, the 10-year-old admitted to authorities
that he had shot Jason, but said he did not know the gun was
loaded, authorities said. The Dallas County Medical Examiner said
Jason suffered a single .22-caliber gunshot wound to the head.
   The boy, whose name was withheld by authorities, was questioned
and released to his mother, police said. The case has been turned
over to the district attorney's office, Police Chief Bruce Beaty
said.
   Officials would not elaborate on Mrs. Cade's relationship to the
boy, but friends said he was her son.
   ``They were in the living room playing video games and he wanted
to go outside and play but Jason said, no, that he wanted to stay
inside,'' said Jason's 18-year-old brother, Sean Powell, in an
account confirmed by police.
   ``He went into another room and came back with a pistol where
Jason was lying on the floor and said, `If you don't go outside to
the playhouse I'm going to shoot you,''' Sean said. ``And he shot
him once in the head. He died instantly.''
   Tuesday night, the single-story brick home where authorities
removed Jason's body after cutting away a section of flooring was
empty. Mrs. Cade had permission to return Tuesday afternoon, but
stayed away, Chamberlain said.
   Authorities and acquaintances said Mrs. Cade lived alone with
her two sons after a separation from her husband. The gun used was
found in her dresser drawer with one spent shell, Chamberlain said.
   ``He just panicked. He was scared. That's the only explanation I
can have for it, but I do believe him,'' said Powell, who returned
from his Navy station in Norfolk, Va., to help lead the search for
his brother.
   ``It must have been hell for a 10-year-old kid to kill his own
friend and not even know the gun was loaded.''

   Thunderstorms and cooler weather soothed parts of the
drought-parched central United States early today, after setting at
least one record for rainfall.
   Madison, Wis., received 1.67 inches of rain on Tuesday, breaking
a 60-year-old mark of 1.62 inches.
   Despite a break in the 100-degree temperatures, health officials
in St. Louis reported another death Tuesday from Saturday's torrid
heat. An 87-year-old woman died of heat stroke, bringing to nine
the number of weather-related deaths there in a recent heat wave.
   In Colorado, a flash flood warning was issued Tuesday night for
parts of Gunnison County as the Ohio Creek flooded its banks and
water up to 4 feet deep surrounded homes north of Gunnison.
   Other heavy rainfall totals early today included 3.1 inches at
Oklahoma City, 2.14 inches at La Crosse, Wis., and 1.19 inches at
Laramie, Wyo.
   Severe weather accompanied the rain in some areas. Thunderstorms
in northwestern Oklahoma produced gusts to 62 mph that downed
trees. Strong thunderstorm winds also downed tree limbs and damaged
a mobile home and a barn.
   A thunderstorm in eastern Nebraska hurled gusts to 65 mph, while
thunderstorms in Montana dropped golf ball-size hail.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended from the high
Plains to the middle Mississippi Valley early today, with
thunderstorms most numerous in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa,
two of the states worst hit by the drought.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms also dampened the
Rocky Mountain region, the Northeast and the Florida peninsula.
   The heat wave continued to break, with temperatures dropping to
the 40s and 50s in the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes
region and the northeastern states early today. Highs were in the
80s in parts of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska.
   The forecast for today called for widespread showers and
thunderstorms from the northern Rockies through the Missouri Valley
into the middle Mississippi Valley and Florida; showers and a few
thunderstorms scattered over much of New England; and mostly sunny
skies over the rest of the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected in the 60s from the upper Great
Lakes through the upper Ohio Valley into New England; in the 70s
from the upper Mississippi Valley into the lower Ohio Valley and
northern sections of the Middle Atlantic Coast region; in the 60s
and 70s in the Pacific Northwest; 100 to 105 degrees across parts
of the lower Mississippi Valley, the plains of the Rio Grande
Valley, the northern California valleys and the desert Southwest;
and in the 80s or 90s across the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Sexton Summit, Ore., to 90 degrees at Las Vegas, Nev.

<HEAD>West Germany To Reopen Probe Into Alleged POW Massacre</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with West German district
prosecutor's office confirming reopened investigation. PICKs up
15th graf, `Ian Sayer ...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LUEBECK, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The district prosecutor's office
today said it has re-opened an investigation of a former Nazi SS
general alleged to have ordered the 1940 massacre in France of 85
British prisoners of war.
   The new probe of Wilhelm Mohnke, dropped for lack of sufficient
evidence in 1973, ``was re-opened after new names of survivors of
the massacre'' turned up, said prosecutor spokesman Joachim
Boettcher.
   The spokesman confirmed the probe when questioned about a report
presented to the House of Commons in London Tuesday by a British
official.
   In the report, junior defense minister Roger Freeman said West
German authorities had agreed to reopen the probe against Mohnke, a
77-year-old retired businessman.
   Boettcher said in a telephone interview from Luebeck that the
case was reopened ``a couple of weeks ago after British journalists
gave us the new names of survivors.''
   Mohnke allegedly ordered that 85 unarmed British prisoners of
war be herded into a barn to be shot by Nazi SS troops at Wormhoudt
near Dunkirk. The SS was a quasi-military special police unit that
was infamous for its brutality.
   A former general who now lives in Stemwarde about three miles
east of Hamburg, Mohnke has repeatedly denied any connection with
the alleged massacre shortly before British forces retreated from
Dunkirk's beaches in the face of the rapid German advance in the
early stages of World War II.
   In the early 1970s, he was also investigated for involvement in
the execution of 72 unarmed U.S. prisoners of war at Malmedy in the
French Ardennes in 1944. West German officials have said that probe
was also dropped for lack of evidence.
   In April, after the British magazine World War II Investigator
traced Mohnke to Stemwarde, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd told
Commons that British officials had reopened a secret file on the
affair. Hurd is the British Cabinet member responsible for law and
order.
   Freeman said today that Britain had no jurisdiction in the case,
but would hand over all the evidence it has.
   He also said an investigation by the War Crimes Interrogation
Unit just after the war concluded that there was not enough
evidence to bring the possible culprits to trial.
   Ian Sayer, publisher of World War II Investigator, told The
Associated Press in April that he traced documents showing Mohnke
was wanted by British, U.S. and Canadian war crimes investigators
at the end of the war.
   But Mohnke was captured by the Soviets, who jailed him for 10
years, and could not be found in 1945, he said.
   On Tuesday, in another case involving alleged war criminals but
not concerning Mohnke, Nazi-hunters handed the British government a
detailed list of 13 alleged war criminals who fled to Britain after
the war.
   They said it was new evidence that Britain harbored Nazi
collaborators, partly to assist with anti-Soviet intelligence.
   The Home Office said it would try to trace the 13 men, White
Russians now aged between 63 and 89. Their names and, in most
cases, specific addresses in British POW camps were first submitted
by the Soviet ambassador in November 1947.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center
said researchers stumbled on the list last week while sifting
through British government records for traces of SS members who
escaped to Canada via Britain after the war.
   The Los Angeles-based Wiesenthal Center, which long has accused
Britain of foot-dragging over fugitive Nazis and their
collaborators, also produced a 1983 letter from Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government saying Britain has not felt obliged
to deport suspected war criminals since 1950.
   ``Now we know why inquiries made about Nazi war criminals from
the beginning were left hanging,'' said Hier.
   ``It was the Cold War and they were interested in (countering)
Communism. They wanted to play ball with the Nazi criminals.''

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials ordered the mock
evacuations of tens of thousands of people during a two-day
exercise which pretended that a crippled Seabrook nuclear power
plant was spewing dangerous radiation.
   Nearly 3,000 federal, state, local and utility officials and
other workers participated Tuesday on the first day of what
Seabrook officials say is the largest test ever of a U.S. nuclear
plant's evacuation plans.
   The plans must be approved before the $5.4 billion plant may
operate commercially.
   Although the mock evacuations would have involved people on
ocean beaches and in New Hampshire and Massachusetts communities up
to five miles away, most members of the public were unaware that
the test was underway.
   More than half the communities within Seabrook's 10-mile
emergency planning zone _ six of 17 in New Hampshire and all six in
Massachusetts _ are not cooperating in the drill.
   As they did in a February 1986 exercise of the New Hampshire
plans, state officials, under pro-Seabrook Gov. John Sununu, filled
in for reluctant local officials. Among 55 deficiencies the Federal
Emergency Management Agency found in the first exercise was
insufficient compensation for non-cooperating communities.
   The test is the first for evacuation plans that Seabrook
developed for the Massachusetts communities. Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential nominee,
refuses to submit plans that he said could never work.
   It's also the first test of procedures for monitoring food up to
50 miles from Seabrook, an area that includes parts of Maine.
   Only the test's controllers knew the scenario for the mock
emergency. They also have the power to improvise as they go along.
   The exercise began with announcement of an imaginary accident
and declaration of an ersatz ``alert,'' the second lowest of four
emergency classifications for nuclear plants.
   Seabrook officials opened emergency operations and media centers
at a power station in Newington, while the state activated a field
office there and emergency management headquarters in Concord. As
the exercise progressed, four reception centers in New Hampshire
and Massachusetts also were opened, but little other real activity
was reported in the field.
   The Concord control center hummed, however, as representatives
of various state agencies calmly talked on the phone and to each
other, took notes and marked off checklists. About a dozen federal
evaluators and exercise controllers watched.
   Officials took imaginary steps like closing some beaches _ they
estimated 10,000 people were on Seabrook and Hampton beaches on
this theoretical cloudy summer day _ and ordering children kept in
some schools as the scenario progressed to a ``site area
emergency'' and a ``general emergency,'' the most serious.

<HEAD>Five Sentenced In Student Slaying That Prompted Protests, One Gets
Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beijing court today sentenced one youth to
death and gave a second a suspended death sentence in the slaying
of a student whose death triggered protests for democracy and
better treatment of intellectuals.
   Three other youths got prison terms, and a sixth defendant was
found guilty of hooliganism but ``escaped criminal punishment,''
the official Beijing Evening News said.
   All six were tried in the Beijing Intermediate People's Court in
connection with a June 1 attack on several Beijing University
students outside an off-campus snackshop and liquor store.
   One of the students, 22-year-old Chai Qingfeng, was shot in the
head with BB gun pellets and beaten with a shovel. He died of his
wounds the following day.
   Nearly 1,000 fellow students marched that night from campus to
central Beijing's Tiananmen Square to demonstrate their sorrow and
demand tighter security for students.
   Over the next week, the target of the students' anger broadened.
Hundreds of posters, most anonymous, went up at Beijing University
denouncing government corruption and demanding democracy and more
funds for education.
   The unrest subsided after police sealed off Tiananmen Square and
intimidated the students into cancelling a second planned march.
   The six suspects were arrested within 48 hours of Chai's death
in an obvious effort to calm the students. The trial, which began
June 18 and was closed to the foreign media, also started with
unusual speed. There have been no official media reports on the
testimony.
   As had been expected, the court ordered the death penalty for
Wang Jian, an unemployed young man with a record of theft who was
identified as the ringleader. He was convicted of deliberate murder.
   In China, executions generally are carried out by a bullet to
the back of head.
   Ha Enming, also unemployed with a theft record, was convicted of
deliberate murder and given a suspended death sentence, to be
reevaluated at the end of two years of labor reform. The report
said he and Wang Jian hit Chai with an iron shovel.
   Wang Jianming and Wang Yonglian were convicted of hooliganism
and sentenced to 15 and seven years in prison, respectively.
   Wang Li, 22, the only woman defendant, was convicted of
harboring a criminal and sentenced to three years. Original press
reports claimed she took part in the attack on Chai and was charged
with hooliganism. The Beijing Evening News did not say if she was
cleared of this charge or give details of whom she hid. The sixth
defendant, Liu Bin, was convicted of hooliganism but not sentenced.
   Wang is a common name in China, and reports have not said if any
of the Wangs are related.
   The attack was the second killing of a university student in
Beijing in the past year. A student at the University of Foreign
Economic Relations was killed in December in a fight with two local
youths. They also were speedily arrested and tried, and one was
executed.
   About 1,000 students marched to government offices in central
Beijing to protest that killing.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher In Early European Trading, Gold Sharply Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher in early European trading
today despite expectations of intervention by European central
banks to keep its rise under control.
   Gold prices, which began falling sharply in New York on Tuesday,
continued dropping in quiet European trading, hitting their lowest
levels in Europe since March.
   Dealers said gold was coming under pressure from the stronger
dollar and receding fears of inflation.
   The dollar was getting support from Japanese remarks that
appeared to indicate a desire for a higher dollar, but the currency
was off its early highs amid worries of central bank intervention,
foreign exchange dealers said.
   Traders in Frankfurt said the market was still reacting to
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who said the Bank of
Japan ``isn't thinking'' of intervening to stem the dollar's recent
rally.
   ``The market is being driven by the dollar-yen rate, and as long
as this seems headed upward, then the dollar will continue to be
firm,'' said a trader in Frankfurt.
   However, fears that central banks would intervene as they did on
Tuesday were putting a psychological barrier on the dollar's climb,
dealers said.
   ``Trading is nervous but light, as everybody is waiting for
possible interventions by European central banks and a likely
half-point rise of the discount rate in West Germany,'' said one
trader with a major Italian commercial bank.
   ``In the absence of any intervention later in the day the dollar
is set to rise again,'' he added.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar broke the 133-yen level for the first time in nearly
seven months before falling back to close at 132.40 yen, up 1.45
yen from Tuesday. Later, in London, it topped 133-yen again and was
quoted at 133.22 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates:
   _1.8235 West German marks, up from 1.8070
   _1.5080 Swiss francs, up from 1.4960
   _6.1415 French francs, up from 6.0885
   _2.0515 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0210
   _1,349.00 Italian lire, up from 1,337.00
   _1.2165 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2105
   In London, the dollar rose against British pound. It cost
$1.7105 to buy one pound, compared with $1.7200 late Tuesday.
   Gold prices fell in reaction to an overall mood that inflation
fears had been exaggerated and expectations that the dollar's rise
will continue pushing gold lower, dealers said.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $437.85 a troy ounce,
down from late Tuesday's $443.20. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a lower recommended price of
$434.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $434.40, down from $443.20 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $6.26 to close at a bid
$440.04. Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.71
a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.92.

<TEXT>
   A Greek terrorist organization blamed for
previous assassinations of American diplomats claimed
responsibility today for a car-bomb blast that killed the U.S.
military attache as he drove to work.
   In a five page statement published in the left wing Athens
afternoon daily Ethnos, November 17 said it would attack more
Americans ``until the last Turkish soldier leaves Cyprus and the
last American soldier leaves our country.''
   U.S. Navy Capt. William Nordeen, 51, was killed Tuesday when a
booby-trapped car blew up next to his armor-plated automobile just
100 yards from his suburban Athens home.
   The blast ripped off the car's roof and flung Nordeen's
decapitated body into the yard of an unoccupied house.
   Many Greeks blame the United States for failing to prevent
Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus after an Athens-inspired coup
there.
   About 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the northern third
of the eastern Mediterranean island, divided into northern Turkish
Cypriot and southern Greek Cypriot sectors.
   The November 17 statement described the 3,500-strong American
military presence in Greece as ``a force of occupation'' and said
``we will strike against anyone of its members or agent of its
secret services.''
   Police said the statement appeared to be genuine.
   ``I don't think anybody except November 17 had the expertise to
pull off something like this,'' a senior police officer said on
condition of anonymity.
   Nordeen and his British wife, Patricia, were due to leave next
month after completing a three-year tour at the U.S. Embassy in
Athens.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou said ``he was deeply grieved'' over
the killing and pledged to fight terrorism.
   ``We really cooperate with the countries of the European
Community and others to face terrorism, which we condemn
unequivocally,'' Papandreou said.
   In the past, Papandreou's socialist government has been
criticized by the United States for laxity in battling terrorism.
   Police said the car-bomb attack was immaculately planned and
detonated by a remote controlled radio device.
   Witnesses told police they saw two dark-complexioned men roaring
away on a motorbike immediately after the explosion. A police
spokesman said a stolen motorcycle was later found in the area.
   November 17 is named for the day in 1973 that troops and tanks
crushed a student rebellion against the 1967-74 dictatorship. The
group has claimed responsibility for the assassinations of Athens
CIA station chief Richard Welch in 1975 and of U.S. Navy Capt.
George Tsantes in 1983.
   The group also claimed responsibility for a failed car-bomb
attack last October against a bus carrying American servicemen.
   None of its members has ever been arrested.
   The killing came four days after Greek and American negotiators
wrapped up a seventh round of slow-moving talks for a new bases
accord. Officials have said the talks are making little progress
but haven't reached an impasse.
   A five-year accord signed by the Papandreou government expires
in December this year. Papandreou has said he is willing to
negotiate a new agreement, but that it must be approved in a
referendum before taking effect.
   Since the 1950s, the United States has operated two bases near
Athens and two on the island of Crete along with a dozen
mountain-top communications installations. In return, Greece gets
military credits totalling more than $340 million every year.
   Neighbors said Nordeen set out for work around 8 a.m. every day,
driving down the tree-lined street where several Western diplomats
live to the main Athens highway.
   The Minnesota native had earlier served as Assistant Naval
Inspector in Washington and with the U.S. Fleet in the Pacific
Ocean.

   Three bombs exploded in the northeastern
state of Assam, killing seven people and injuring 59, the United
News of India said today.
   Police blamed the blasts Tuesday on extremists from the Bodo
tribe who are fighting for a separate Indian state for Bodos.
   The explosions occurred near Barpeta Road, a town 85 miles north
of Dispur, capital of Assam, a tea-growing state bordering
Bangladesh and Bhutan.
   Two suspects have been detained in connection with the blasts,
UNI said.
   Authorities banned public assembly in the area in an effort to
prevent further trouble.

   A former university professor convicted of
murdering a teen-age male prostitute and dismembering his body with
a chain saw will seek a new trial, his attorney says.
   Max Bernard Franc, 58, was found guilty of first-degree murder
Tuesday by a jury that deliberated less than three days.
   ``I've never been as disappointed in a verdict as I've been in
this verdict,'' deputy public defender Mark Kaiserman said, adding
he would appeal the conviction.
   Franc was accused of shooting Tracy Leroy Nute, 18, cutting up
the body in a bathtub and distributing the parts across 200 miles
of California. Franc claimed a man named Terry Adams committed the
gruesome killing last August. The prosecution contended Adams does
not exist.
   ``I think the jury did the right and justifiable thing,'' said
Deputy District Attorney Sterling Norris.
   Sentencing was scheduled for July 29.
   The prosecutor said he would seek the maximum possible sentence
of 25 years to life in prison, which would make Franc eligible for
parole in 12{ years.
   After the verdict, Kaiserman said he remains convinced of
Franc's innocence.
   ``I would describe him as a very passive individual who does not
have an assaultive bone in his body and would not be able to commit
this type of crime,'' the attorney said.
   A ruling by Superior Court Judge John H. Reid excluded critical
evidence from the trial regarding a potential suspect, Kaiserman
said.
   Jurors were never told that the man, Peter Krizek, had been
charged in a similar dismemberment case eight years ago. The last
of his four trials ended in a jury deadlock. Krizek testified
during Franc's trial that he had nothing to do with the Nute
killing.
   Franc, a native of De Pere, Wis., was a public administration
professor at California State University in Fresno until his arrest
last August.
   Jurors were told Franc lived a double life _ a conservative
professor in Fresno but a homosexual voyeur about 210 miles away in
West Hollywood, who paid young men to be photographed in sexual
poses.
   Nute, a runaway from Kansas City, Mo., who came to California to
be a movie star, wound up working as a prostitute.
   Franc was arrested after a chain saw he rented was returned with
blood and flesh in its works.
   The case against Franc was circumstantial. Forensic experts
found traces of blood throughout his West Hollywood apartment as
well as in his car. The murder weapon was found in Franc's
university office. A motorist identified Franc as the man he saw
sitting in a car near a freeway offramp where body parts were found.

   A man who ignited a gas explosion that
leveled two row houses, killin himself and an elderly neighbor, had
threatened suicide for weeks and warned his teen-age daughter not
to come home, acquaintances said.
   Nine people were injured in Monday night's explosion, including
a 3-year-old boy who was found nine hours after the blast buried
under 10 feet of shattered brick and splintered wood. Onlookers
applauded as rescuers carried Harry Mertz out on a stretcher
Tuesday.
   The boy was listed in guarded condition today with second- and
third-degree burns on 11 percent of his body, said Phyllis Propert,
spokeswoman for St. Christopher's Hospital for Children.
   Richard Litostansky, a handyman neighbors say was distraught
over his wife's plans to leave him, ignited a gas line he opened in
his basement and set off the explosion, authorities said.
   ``Friends and neighbors have said he threatened suicide. For the
past several weeks, he's been talking it up pretty good. Apparently
he was in the basement, opened the gas line and blew it,'' police
Detective Mike Boyle said.
   Litostansky, 45, and Bernard Fink, 82, who lived in the
connecting row house, died in the blast. The injured included two
police officers.
   Litostansky stopped in two doors away at the corner bar, the
Stock Exchange, for a beer Monday night.
   ``When he came in, he was acting crazy and all. So I flagged him
for the night. He went up to the corner with his daughter. I could
hear him say, `I'm going to kill myself. Don't come home
tonight,''' bartender Dan Wallace said.
   Earlier in the day, Litostansky had said he would kill himself
because of plans by his wife, Penny, to leave him, said a friend,
Robert W. Jenkins.
   Jenkins, 36, said he tried to persuade Litostansky to leave the
gas-filled house and even offered him money.
   ``He just kept backing up. I knew something was going down,''
Jenkins said.
   ```I'm taking you with me, Bobby! You're my only friend!'''
Jenkins said Litostansky screamed to him from the basement. Jenkins
said he ran for the door and was on the top step when the blast
blew him onto the sidewalk.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury charged three civilian
managers of an Army chemical weapons program at Aberdeen Proving
Ground with illegally dumping hazardous wastes that leaked into a
creek.
   ``We certainly did not have a Bhopal out there, but I think
frankly we're lucky because the environment existed out there to
have a major environmental disaster,'' U.S. Attorney Breckenridge
L. Willcox said, referring to the industrial accident in India that
claimed more than 2,000 lives.
   ``We suspect that serious environmental violations persist,''
Willcox said, predicting that more indictments would follow those
handed up Tuesday. He said some of the problems at Aberdeen, a
79,000-acre testing ground for weapons and chemicals 25 miles
northeast of Baltimore, have been addressed.
   The grand jury indicted William Dee, 49, Robert Lentz, 50, and
Carl Gepp, 51. All were top managers between 1983 and 1986, when
the alleged violations occurred at the Army's Chemical Research
Development and Engineering Center.
   The indictment alleged the three intentionally stored chemical
wastes such as ethyl acetate, hydrazine, picric acid and ethyl
ether in deteriorating containers in an Army building without a
permit.
   The first four counts of the five-count indictment _ including
the illegal storage, dumping and handling of hazardous wastes _ are
felonies. The fifth count, a water pollution charge, is a
misdemeanor.
   The three men, who are to be arraigned in the next week or two,
face up to 21 years in prison and $1.1 million in fines each if
convicted on all charges.
   ``This case is not one of technical or minor violations,''
Willcox said. ``Rather, it concerns the willful, intentional and
deliberate failure to comply with the law over a period of years by
the managers of the Army's chemical weapons testing program.
   ``The Army, like everyone else, is required in this district to
obey the law,'' said Willcox, the top federal prosecutor for
Maryland.
   According to the indictment, chemicals leaked into the base's
sanitary sewer and Canal Creek, which leads into the Bush River and
eventually Chesapeake Bay.
   Investigators have said they do not know whether any people were
adversely affected, but Willcox said the alleged dumping caused a
major fish kill on a Chesapeake Bay tributary.
   The FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency cooperated in an
18-month investigation in the case, Willcox said.
   The defendants are chemical engineers and longtime government
employees. None was available for comment, but attorney Richard
Karceski said they would plead innocent and ``go to trial and win
their case.''
   ``There is not a scintilla of criminal intent among these three
men,'' Karceski said.
   Acknowledging that hazardous waste problems may have existed at
Aberdeen, Karceski said the three defendants ``are people who tried
to do their best'' to correct alleged defeciencies.
   ``This was not an individual problem but a problem of the
Army,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Investigators tried today to reconstruct the 40
minutes between the discovery of brake problems on a Paris-bound
commuter train and its collision with a crowded train, which killed
59 people.
   The state-run rail company, SNCF, said the engineer realized his
brakes weren't working when he was more than a mile away from the
busy Gare de Lyon station and warned passengers to get to the back
of the train.
   The brake trouble on the eight-car train began five miles
outside the station after a passenger pulled the emergency stop at
Vert de Maisons, an unscheduled station, at about 6:30 p.m. Monday,
the company said. It wasn't known why the passenger pulled the cord.
   After a 26-minute delay there, the train continued on toward
Paris. But the brake problems continued, and a mile from the
station engineer Daniel Saulin appeared unable to stop the train.
   Saulin, 42, alerted the station controller and then his
passengers as the train rushed at 40-50 mph through a stop signal
600 yards from impact.
   Rail officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
station controller did not have time to reroute the train and it
slammed into the stationary four-car train at 7:10 p.m.
   Normal procedure would have been for the arriving train to stop
at the 600- yard signal and get directions to the appropriate track.
   Through the night and into Tuesday morning, 250 rescue workers
struggled to free the injured. The number of bodies grew steadily
and the crash became Paris' worst train disaster.
   SNCF reported 59 dead. Paris emergency services said 38 were
injured.
   SNCF, the Transport Ministry and judicial authorities are each
conducting their own investigation into the crash, said Philippe
Rouvillois, director general of the rail company.
   ``There is a tie, the nature of which we do not yet know,
between the use of the alarm signal (emergency stop), which had
immobilized the train a short time before ... and the
catastrophe,'' SNCF official Roger Gerin told a news conference.
``The origin of the accident was difficulties with the braking
system but we do not know the exact cause.''
   SNCF officials said Saulin, realizing about a mile from the Gare
de Lyon that he could not stop, was able to slow down slightly by
using an emergency brake.
   Gerin said Saulin's train had made 15 stops along its route and
that the brakes worked normally at each.
   After the passenger pulled the emergency stop, ``the engineer
experienced difficulty in trying to re-arm the brake system, but he
resumed his trip,'' Gerin said. He gave no details about the brake
problem.
   A passenger on the train, Laure Cocu, told the French daily
Liberation that while the train was stopped at the unscheduled
station she heard a noise like the release of air from the train's
pneumatic brakes.
   ``We heard a rush of air, a little like the noise in a
factory,'' she told the newspaper. ``Some passengers in my car got
off. My colleague saw the conductor and the engineeer by the side
of the train looking under the car.
   ``My colleague heard the engineer say, `The brakes are blocked
at the back.'''
   The engineer on the train in the station, Andre Tanguy, was
killed in the crash. Francis Boulanger, SNCF spokesman, said
earlier reports that he escaped might have resulted from confusion
with other railroad employees who jumped from the train. Boulanger
said Tanguy was one of seven employees who died.
   Asked whether the age of the train might have been a factor,
Gerin said trains undergo maintenance four times a year in addition
to routine checks and this particular train had been checked just
days before the crash.

   Two Japanese F-15J fighter jets collided today over
the Sea of Japan and crashed into the ocean, the military said. The
two pilots of the aircraft were missing.
   Fumihiro Inagaki, spokesman for Japan's Air Self-Defense Force,
said the single-seat aircraft were from the ASDF base at Komatsu,
about 180 miles northwest of Tokyo.
   He said the pilots were on training missions and that a search
was under way for them.
   The cause of the collision was not known immediately, Inagaki
said, adding that he had no other details of the crash.
   It was the first mid-air collision of the F-15J fighters since
the ASDF began flying the aircraft in 1981.

<HEAD>Foreign-Born Americans Spend Less Time Hospitalized Or Sick at
Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Native-born Americans spend more time in
hospitals or sick in bed at home, and visit doctors more
frequently, a federal study says.
   The National Center for Health Statistics compared the health of
native-and foreign-born residents of the United States, aged 18 and
over, and found that the newcomers appear to be the healthier group.
   Dr. Gerry E. Hendershot, author of the report ``Health of the
Foreign-Born Population: United States, 1985-86,'' said a number of
possible reasons could account for this difference.
   ``One factor that certainly is involved is the selectivity of
immigration to this country,'' he said in a telephone interview
this week.
   ``People with higher educations and professional skills have a
better opportunity to migrate to this country, so people coming
here tend to be from groups that have good health,'' he said.
   In addition, the Immigration and Naturalization Service does
some health screening, Hendershot said. Plus, ``immigrants tend to
be younger, on average, than the general population, and younger
people in general tend to be healther than older people.''
   Finally, he noted that the study was based on interviews with
58,682 households. By looking at household groups, the analysis
would not include transients, such as migrant workers, who may tend
to be in poorer health, Hendershot commented.
   He added that he hoped to undertake another study in the future
aimed at detailing the reasons for health differences.
   According to the survey:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Some 10.8 percent of native Americans had been hospitalized in
the previous year, compared to 9.5 percent of the foreign-born.
   _Reporting six or more contacts with a doctor or other health
professional in the year were 18.5 percent of natives and 16.2
percent of the foreign-born.
   _When it came to spending four or more days in the year staying
home sick in bed, native-born people led 22.8 percent to 18.8
percent.
   The difference between native-born and foreign-born people in
being sick in bed for four days or more covered all age groups up
to 65. Over age 65, however, the groups were similar to one another
_ 26.3 percent for natives and 27.6 percent of foreign borns.
   By sex, 18.5 percent of native-born males were sick in bed four
days, compared to 15.3 percent of foreign-born men. For women, the
figures were 26.8 percent for natives and 22.0 percent for those
from overseas.
   Turning to hospital stays, the 10.8 percent of natives
hospitalized in the prior year included 8.6 percent of men and 12.8
percent of women. Foreign-born people were hospitalized at a 9.5
percent rate, 7.0 percent for men and 11.8 percent for women.
   Six or more physician contacts during the year were reported by
13.3 percent of native men and 23.1 percent of women. The figures
for those born elsewhere were 10.6 percent for men and 22.5 percent
for women.
   The survey also asked if people were limited in any of their
activities by chronic physical problems.
   Some 17.6 percent of native-born Americans aged 18 and over
reported some such limitation. This included 16.9 percent of men
and 18.2 percent of women.
   Among the foreign born, 13.2 percent reported chronic health
problems limiting their activities. This included 11.9 percent of
men and 14.5 percent of women.
   Finally, people were asked to generally rate their own health.
   In this category, the share who said they considered themselves
in only fair or poor health was identical in both groups at 12.9
percent.
   However, the fair and poor category included 11.9 percent of
native men compared to 11.0 percent of foreign-born men. For native
born women, 13.8 percent said they were in fair or poor health,
compared to 14.6 percent of the foreign born.
   Of the approximately 156.6 million Americans aged 18 and over at
the time of the survey, about 14.9 million were listed as foreign
born.

   Thieves stole a self-portrait of the
20th-century Dutch painter Charley Toorop from an isolated museum
in the woods, the Culture Ministry said today.
   The theft at the Kroller-Muller museum, about 10 miles north of
the eastern city of Arnhem, was the fifth reported in the
Netherlands in as many weeks.
   A museum guard reported Toorop's 1934 ``Self-Portrait'' missing
at about 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
   The value of the 24-by-18-inch canvas is estimated at $20,000.
   Culture Ministry spokeswoman Annemarie Stordiau said there were
no suspects in the theft.
   Charley Toorop was born in 1891, the daughter of Dutch
impressionist Jan Toorop. Her work, which includes numerous
self-portraits, is marked by its brown and gray coloring. She died
in 1955.
   The Kroller-Muller museum, whose collection includes 19th- and
20th-century art, is in a nature reserve.
   Among the five recent thefts, the most spectacular occurred on
May 20, when three paintings worth up to $52 million _ including a
Van Gogh and a Cezanne _ were stolen from Amsterdam's Municipal
Museum. They were recovered by police 10 days later.

   President Reagan finds himself inadvertently
in the middle of a Republican primary fight in Florida as he
launches what aides say will be an active campaign season on behalf
of GOP candidates.
   Reagan was flying to Miami today for a fund-raising spech on
behalf of third-term Rep. Connie Mack III, grandson of the
legendary baseball manager, who is seeking the seat of retiring
Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles.
   The president, who follows a policy of not interfering in
primary contests, accepted the speaking date weeks ago on the
assumption that Mack would be unopposed in the Sept. 6 Florida
primary.
   On Monday, however, U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, the prosecutor
who obtained a drug indictment against Panamanian Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, resigned his federal post and jumped into the race.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked whether this made
the Miami speech inconsistent with Reagan's hands-off policy in
primaries, said, ``Well, circumstances have made it a little
inconsistent.''
   ``The president has campaigned for Connie Mack in the past and
stated his support for him,'' Fitzwater said. ``And so
circumstances simply created this situation.''
   Mark Mills, communications director for the Mack campaign, said,
``The president gave his word and his commitment to support Connie
Mack and I just think the president is following through on that.''
   Mills said the president's visit is expected to garner about
$600,000. He said Reagan would pose for photographs with people who
have raised at least $10,000 for the campaign or the state
Republican Party, and then speak at a luncheon. Luncheon tickets
were $500 or $1,000, depending on where the seats were.
   The spokesman said the money raised will be split evenly between
the Mack campaign and the state GOP. Merkle, who said he would not
come to the luncheon because he was not invited and didn't want to
be rude, said Monday the money should be put in escrow and held for
the winner of the primary.
   Reagan also planned to meet privately with leaders of Miami's
large Cuban-American community. Cuban-Americans have generally
supported Reagan although some have argued that he is softening on
Fidel Castro by negotiating on immigration, human rights and Angola.
   It is the president's fourth visit to Miami and his 10th to
Florida during his second term.
   Republicans would need a net gain of five seats to regain
control of the Senate. Although the president has appeared at
fund-raising events in Washington for GOP Senate candidates, this
is his first political foray out of the capital in the 1988
campaign.
   Fitzwater said there will be more.
   ``The political activities haven't been fleshed out yet, but as
a general matter, you will have fund-raisers attended by the
president _ some for the party, some for specific candidates,'' he
said.
   The White House spokesman said the extent of Reagan's
campaigning for Vice President George Bush, the apparent GOP
nominee for president, ``will all be firmed up in the next few
weeks.''

<HEAD>Police Gas Arab Schoolgirls Protesting Outside U.S. Consulate</HEAD>

   U.S. officials today said Israeli police hurled
tear gas at a group of Arab teen-agers staging a peaceful sit-in
outside the U.S. Consulate to protest the closing of their school.
   The officials said that they had asked that tear gas not be used.
   In the occupied West Bank, soldiers shot and wounded two
Palestinian youths, including one who was in serious condition,
hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the reports.
   American officials said the tear gas was thrown after the
schoolgirls left the consulate parking lot and as the half-hour
demonstration appeared to be breaking up.
   A consulate spokesman said the girls, mostly 13- and
14-year-olds, didn't throw stones and only held up handwritten
signs saying, ``Please Open Our Schools.'' About 30 police and riot
police were at the scene, said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. He said there were about 75 protesters.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy put the number of demonstrating
schoolgirls at 200 and said tear gas was used only after the
students were warned to disperse.
   ``The use of tear gas is based on operational considerations of
the moment,'' Levy said. ``If there are official complaints about
police behavior, I would be glad to check them and respond.''
   Several Arab schoolgirls were arrested outside a school in east
Jerusalem after they tried to incite fellow students to protest,
Levy said.
   Israeli officials have closed 34 schools in Arab east Jerusalem
and the occupied West Bank, contending schools are a central spot
for anti-Israeli demonstrations since the Arab uprising began
nearly seven months ago.
   Since Dec. 8, 211 Palestinians and four Israelis have been
killed.
   Israeli troops shot and wounded two Palestinians, one 17 and the
other 22, in clashes near the casbah, or Arab marketplace, in the
West Bank city of Nablus, officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad and St.
Luke hospitals said.
   The teen-ager, shot in the stomach, was reported in serious
condition.
   In the West Bank city of Hebron, troops welded shut 24 stores on
a street where a Jewish settler was stabbed Friday, Palestinian
witnesses said.
   Israel radio said the army had detained members of a guerrilla
unit believed to be responsible for recent attacks in the Hebron
area.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today that
Israel will bolster its military might to counter the buildup of
sophisticated missiles among Arab nations.
   Shamir's comments, carried on Israel radio, came a day after the
United States promised to help Israel develop an anti-ballistic
missile in response to ``ominous new military developments in the
region.''
   The new technology, designed to shoot down ballistic missiles,
will cost $120 million to $130 million dollars, the daily Jerusalem
Post said. The White House said the United States will pay about 80
percent of the costs.
   Recent reports have said that China is preparing to sell Syria
its most advanced surface-to-surface missile, the M-9. The M-9 has
a range of 375 miles.
   Speaking in the coastal city of Caesaria, Shamir said the
planned sale meant Israel would step up efforts to find a response.
   ``It obliges us ... to increase our eforts in preparing answers
to this threat. We are working in this field. There are answers and
we have to improve them,'' Shamir said.
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres expressed concern
about ``the production of ground-to-ground missiles with chemical
warheads in the hands of governments that occasionally have lost
their balanced judgment and want to attack Israel just because they
have a weapon.''
   ``I'm sure and I know what I'm speaking about that (we)...will
find a reply to it,'' Peres said.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is ordering
operators of 37 nuclear reactors to review safety procedures after
power levels fluctuated erratically at an Illinois plant.
   The alert for operators of boiling-water reactors was prompted
by a March 9 incident in which two pumps used to circulate water
through a Commonwealth Edison Co. reactor were shut off, triggering
an uncontrolled fluctuation of power, the NRC said Tuesday.
   The incident, at Edison's LaSalle Unit 2 near Ottawa, Ill.,
ended without harm after the reactor exceeded its rated capacity
and shut down automatically, the commission said.
   Although Commonwealth Edison handled the situation properly, the
problem could have been serious, NRC spokesman Frank Ingram said.
   ``The power was oscillating like mad, from 25 percent one minute
to something else the next,'' added Michael Mariotte, director of
the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, a private
clearinghouse for information about nuclear energy and radiation
effects.
   ``Then, it suddenly burst up to 118 percent of power before an
automatic setpoint finally shut the plant down,'' he said. ``We're
real concerned about what would have happened had that one
automatic setpoint failed.''
   However, an NRC official said there was no threat of a meltdown.
   ``We didn't know how much worse the situation could get,'' said
Ashok Thadani, its assistant director of engineering and systems
technology. ``There was the potential _ not likely, but the
potential _ of fuel damage. But a whole lot of other things have to
go wrong before you worry about a (radiation) release.''
   The incident was the first of its kind in the United States,
although engineers had calculated that such an event could occur
without warning at any of 37 U.S. plants using boiling-water
reactors, the NRC said. Most of the nation's 110 licensed plants
use pressurized water, rather than boiling water, to turn their
turbines.
   Edison spokeswoman Deborah Vestal said both pumps inadvertently
were shut off at the same time during routine calibration of
instruments, and the mixture of cold and hot water in the reactor
system when the pumps started again caused the power fluctuation.
   ``It was a one-in-a-million thing,'' Ms. Vestal said. ``At the
instant, we knew what was occurring and we knew what to do to cease
it. That's what was done. There was no damage to the fuel. There
was no release of radiation. There was no suffering at the plant.''
   Ingram called the incident a fluke but said the NRC is advising
utilities using similar reactors about what happened at LaSalle.
   He said the commission would make sure plant operators are
briefed so they can recognize the conditions leading up to
uncontrolled power changes and know what to do about them.
   ``The NRC is admitting it does not yet know of a hardware way to
fix the problem,'' Mariotte said. ``We would like to see them come
up with some sort of solution rather than telling the operators
simply to watch out for it.''
   These are the 37 reactors affected, listed first by the name of
the operating utility, followed by the name of the plant and then
its location.
   In some cases, the location name may vary from the name in
common use in the area. The Pilgrim, Peach Bottom and Browns Ferry
plants are not operating while their owners try to improve
management to satisfy the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

   Discarded plastic, already blamed for the deaths
of hundreds of thousands of birds and fish in the oceans and along
seashores, is spreading to the Great Lakes.
   The virtually indestructible material is becoming not just an
eyesore but a potential threat to wildlife in the world's largest
freshwater system, according to researchers and lay observers.
   Jim Mattis of Benzonia, Mich., has operated fishing charter
boats for 15 years in Lake Michigan. He said he's found plastic
debris floating up to 10 miles offshore, some of it in ``scum
lines'' of garbage a mile long.
   ``There's more plastic bags and pieces of Visquine (a trade name
for plastic sheeting) in the lake than I've ever seen,'' Mattis
said. ``It's gotten worse in the last three or four years.
   ``I've heard a lot of people say, `It's just a plastic bag.'
They don't realize the damage it can do.''
   Most legislation, research and enforcement has focused on a
different kind of Great Lakes pollution _ toxic chemicals that
threaten widespread areas and can be traced to specific sources.
   ``There're about 1,000 different types of hazardous substances
that are known to exist in the Great Lakes,'' said Cameron Davis, a
research analyst with the Chicago-based Lake Michigan Federation.
``Right now, toxics (and) contaminated sediments are the No. 1
thing.''
   Plastic pollution is less fully understood, although its
potential for harm is clear. A single shard of plastic sheeting,
six-pack beverage carrier or strand of fishing line can float
undetected until it strangles fish or birds, binds a boat propeller
or jams an engine intake.
   ``We see the pictures every year; we know it happens,'' said
Glen Dudderar, a Michigan State University biologist. ``But we
don't have any research on to what extent.''
   The Michigan Department of Natural Resources estimated that one
bird in 100 observed by biologists was entangled in plastic fishing
line, according to a 1987 report by the Washington-based Center for
Environmental Education. Entanglement can also mean ingestion of
the plastic.
   Little is known, too, about another synthetic material
intentionally put into the lakes: fishing nets that are loosed
accidentally, but continue trapping their prey.
   ``Ghost fishing'' has been documented mainly along the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts. But it also occurs in Great Lakes waters where
gill-net fishing is done, either by state-regulated commercial
interests or by Indians working under terms of federal treaties,
officials said.
   ``From the fisheries' standpoint, the worst thing we've got is
gill nets that break away,'' said Asa Wright, manager of the Great
Lakes Program of the state DNR's Fisheries Division.
   Just last month, authorities retrieved a gill net containing
more than 600 pounds of rotting lake trout. The 1,000-foot-long,
44-inch-wide net probably had been adrift several months in
southern Lake Superior, investigators said.
   Bill Eger, a biologist who works with Michigan's Indian
fishermen, said gill nets occasionally are abandoned or torn from
buoys in storms or by passing freighters.
   But the approximately 350 Indians who fish in the
treaty-protected waters of northwestern Lake Huron, northern Lake
Michigan and south central Lake Superior usually set and retrieve
their gill nets daily, Eger said.
   Since gill nets cost about $1 a yard, they're seldom abandoned,
he said. Those that aren't retrieved tend to ``ball up'' and sink,
bearing only the fish trapped on the first day or two after being
set, he said.
   ``It does not continue to catch fish at an exponential rate, as
Asa Wright would like to have you believe,'' Eger said.
   Charter skipper Mattis said plastic refuse poses a threat to
navigation.
   ``My son last year blew out an engine when a plastic bag got
sucked up in the intake,'' he said. ``I had a piece two years ago
... an 8-foot piece of Visquine that got around my prop. It
wouldn't come off, it knotted up so bad. Luckily a shaft didn't
break.''
   The governor has signed legislation that will make Michigan the
13th state _ and the second in the Great Lakes region after
Wisconsin _ to require that six-pack beverage carriers be made of
plastic material that degrades within 360 days of exposure to
sunlight.
   Enforcement of anti-dumping laws is isolated, conceded Capt.
Larry Murdock, chief of th Marine Safety Division of the U.S. Coast
Guard's district office in Cleveland.
   Disposal of solid waste anywhere in the Great Lakes has been
illegal for years, Murdock said. Freighters and other large
commercial vessels are required to store or incinerate their trash
rather than dump it overboard, a practice common among oceangoing
ships and blamed for at least part of the plastic pollution at sea.
   ``For the pleasure boaters, I don't think you're going to find
any enforcement,'' Murdock said. ``We haven't apprehended anyone.
... You're talking about an individual-type problem.''
   Department of Natural Resources biologists have estimated that
Michigan's recreational boaters produce up to 26,000 tons of
garbage a year. An unknown percentage of that total finds its way
into the lakes.
   The plastics industry has joined government and environmental
groups in conducting public education campaigns about plastic
pollution in the Great Lakes and oceans alike.
   Brochures describing the harm done to marine life by discarded
plastic, have been jointly distributed by the Center for
Environmental Education, the Marine Entanglement Research Program
of the National Marine Fisheries Service and The Society of the
Plastics Industry Inc., an industry group.
   The Fisheries Service and Defenders of Wildlife, another
Washington-based environmental group, have distributed similar
brochures encouraging boaters and beach visitors to dispose of
trash properly.
   Individuals can do the most to turn back the invasion of plastic
flotsam, said Tom Martin, director of Michigan's Office of the
Great Lakes: ``The absolute key thing is people's individual
responsibility, that it has consequences for the environment.''

   Secretary of State George Shultz may visit the
Middle East in July to try to push his regional peace initiative, a
senior American official said today.
   Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost said he discussed the
possibility of a Shultz visit during two days of talks with Israeli
leaders. Armacost spoke to reporters at Ben Gurion International
Airport before leaving Israel.
   Shultz has made three unsuccessful tours of the Middle East
since October in an effort to try to persuade Israel and Arabs
states to adopt his peace plan before American and Israeli
elections in November.
   The plan calls for convening an international conference under
the auspices of the United Nations to serve as a launching pad for
direct bilateral talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
   The conference would be attended by the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union,
Britain, France and China.
   The idea is favored by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres but opposed
by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who fears the international body
would be hostile toward Israel.
   The Israeli daily Maariv reported that a decision on the Shultz
visit would be made after a meeting between Assistant Secretary of
State Richard Murphy and Vladimir P. Polyakov, head of the Middle
East desk in the Soviet Foreign Ministry. The two are to meet in
Europe next month.
   Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said the two-day
meeting would be devoted to ironing out U.S.-Soviet differences
over the role of superpowers in the proposed international forum.
   While the United States favors a largely ceremonial role, the
Soviet Union has insisted on more active involvement.
   The Kremlin also supports the participation of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Israel views the PLO as a terrorist group
and refuses to negotiate with it, and the United States backs
Israel's position.

   Gerald and Sandy Smith's feathers aren't
exactly ruffled over their unexpected houseguests, but the visitors
are nothing to crow about either.
   For one thing, the Smiths are waking up earlier now, 4 a.m. to
be exact, because of the dozen roosters that mysteriously appeared
on their lawn and haven't left yet.
   The fowl visitors arrived in the dead of night and announced
their presence in the customary way: with loud crowing to greet the
dawn.
   ``Dawn comes earlier for roosters than it does for humans,''
Mrs. Smith noted.
   After their first rude awakening, the couple called the police,
but the only advice they could offer was, ``Make soup.''
   For the past 12 days, the chickens _ who appear to be all
roosters _ have resisted all efforts to get them to fly their
newfound coop. They roost among trees along the road at night and
wander over the Smiths' three-acre spread during the day.
   They even _ no jokes, please _ cross the road to explore the
woods and fields on the other side.
   The Smiths have taken the invasion good-naturedly, although to
Smith, it is becoming about as humorous as the old joke.
   ``It's funny, but when you're awakened at 4:30 every morning, it
loses its charm fast,'' he said.
   The Smiths have enlisted the aid of the Connecticut Humane
Society and a local 4-H Club, but the chickens have managed to
elude any attempts at capture. Now, the couple is offering free
chickens for the taking.
   If no one takes them up on the offer, nature will probably solve
the problem in its own manner.
   ``What's going to happen eventually is that they'll be picked
off by predators _ foxes, raccoons,'' Mrs. Smith said. ``And that
will be it.''
   Already, she said Tuesday, there appear to be only about seven
chickens left from the original dozen.
   But all things considered, she said, ``it's not a bad way to go.
They're probably having the time of their life, eating bugs,
roaming free. And then they come back and find bread under the
tree.''
   The Smiths have been feeding the birds. ``I don't know whether
we should be doing that,'' Smith said. ``But we felt sorry for
them.''
   Where the chickens came from in the first place remains a
mystery.
   If it was a prank _ the chickens arrived on the weekend that
many high schools staged graduation ceremonies _ the Smiths have no
clue as to who is responsible, or why.
   Wherever they came from, the chickens appear to like their new
home, and the Smiths are adjusting.
   ``If you don't like it, you shouldn't live in the country,''
Mrs. Smith said philosophically. ``I'm sure a lot of city people
wouldn't like it at all.''

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre today
ordained 16 new traditionalist priests and urged them to join the
fight against the ``cancer of liberalism'' in the Roman Catholic
Church.
   The ordinations came on the eve of the consecration of four
bishops by Lefebvre, a move that will cause the first schism, or
split in the Church, in more than a century and lead to Lefebvre's
excommunication.
   At least 5,000 sympathizers watched the four-hour ceremony.
Several traveled up to 16 hours to reach this Swiss hamlet, the
birthplace of Lefebvre's St. Pius X fraternity.
   In his homily, the French-born prelate did not make any
reference to his threatened excommunication. The Vatican said it
will take effect as soon as he goes ahead with the consecrations
without papal approval.
   Lefebvre, whose movement is fighting reforms of the Second
Vatican Council, said it was since the Council in 1962-65 that
``the cancer of liberalism is spreading in the church.''
   ``Join the fight against liberalism, that false notion of
freedom,'' he said. ``And be prepared to suffer persecution.
Whatever you may be told, you will remain Catholic.''
   The Vatican announced it was canceling a symphony concert to
express its ``deep pain''' over the impending schism.
   The concert of Ludwig van Beethoven's ``Missa Solemnis'' was
scheduled for Thursday evening in the Vatican's Paul VI Auditorium,
as part of a series of cultural events marking the current Marian
Year.
   ``In anticipation of the grave act that will take place tomorrow
to the damage of the unity of the church, the president of the
Committee for the Marian Year announces that the concert is
canceled,'' a Vatican statement said.
   Today's ceremony brought to 220 the number of priests ordained
by Lefebvre in defiance of an earlier Vatican sanction imposed in
1976 that bars him from celebrating Mass or giving the sacraments.
   Many knelt during the ordination Mass, celebrated in Latin
according to the 16th century Tridentine rite. The Vatican Council
replaced it with the Mass in vernacular.
   Many in the crowd were seen buying a dossier on Thursday's
consecration that contained the text of a letter Lefebvre had
addressed to the four future bishops. In it, he charged that ``the
chair of Peter and the posts of authority in Rome are occupied by
antichrists.''
   That was why, he said, he felt obliged to proceed with the
consecrations ``so that the Catholic Church and priesthood will
continue to exist for the glory of God.''
   ``History will prove that he is right,'' said Mark Simmons, a
29-year-old accounting clerk who flew over from London for the
occasion. ``The threat of excommuncation does not impress me at
all. It cannot be valid. It would mean condemnation of 2,000 years
of church history.''
   Pierre Papay, a 43-year-old French businessman from Angers, said
he had come to demonstrate his ``total support'' for Lefebvre.
``I'm not worried at all by these threats.''
   Dominique Bochatay, a 30-year-old Swiss teacher, said ``there
will be no schism, certainly not by us. Schismatic are those who
break with the tradition, who break with Jesus Christ.''

   Prosecutors are keeping sealed a long-anticipated
federal indictment for illegally shipping arms to the Nicaraguan
Contras, but defense attorneys already are criticizing it for
penalizing soldiers, instead of the generals.
   The indictment was returned Tuesday by a Fort Lauderdale grand
jury that had called witnesses to testify about illegal arms
flights to El Salvador and private training for Nicaraguan rebels.
   A source close to the investigation, who spoke under condition
of anonymity, said the charges may not be made public for a week or
more.
   Among those expected to be charged are Tom Posey and some who
worked for him at the private Civilian Material Assistance group,
which claims to have collected $3 million for the Contras, said
Posey's attorney Doug Jones.
   He said the charges will be based on the Neutrality Act, which
bans private citizens from interfering in foreign affairs.
   ``I have a real hard time understanding why this will be a
violation of the Neutrality Act now when it wasn't three years
ago,'' Jones said.
   Posey and the organization were ``absolutely, totally''
encouraged by the Reagan administration to help the Contras and did
so openly, Jones said.
   Posey, who testified before the grand jury, said, ``Everything
we have done is legal.''
   ``We have never provided lethal weapons to the Contras,'' he
added.
   Critics of the investigation say it charges those who carried
out plans to aid the Contras, but not those who designed the plans.
   John Mattes, a federal public defender in Miami, says the U.S.
attorney's office dragged its feet in the investigation for
political reasons and tried to keep him from investigating the case
of his client, Jesus Garcia.
   Garcia, now out on parole from a minor weapons conviction, tried
to get a reduced sentence by saying he had participated in a
government-backed arms-smuggling operation out of Fort Lauderdale.
Mattes claimed prosecutors and FBI agents tried to convince him to
drop the defense investigation.
   Then-U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner, along with prosecutors later
called before a congressional committee, strongly denied the charge.
   Mattes said there is little likelihood the indictments will
include higher-ups who ordered the illegal arms shipments.
   ``It was coordinated by Robert Owen on behalf of Oliver North,''
Mattes said Tuesday. Owen, the State Department liaison to the
Contras, worked closely with North.
   ``The foot soldiers are never charged in wars, it is the people
that ordered them, that directed them.''
   The arms shipment that sparked the investigation was flown out
of Fort Lauderdale in March 1985 after supporters of the rebels
gathered 20mm cannons, M-60 machine guns, mortar shells, automatic
rifles and ammunition at various points around Miami.
   Steven Carr, a Civilian Material Assistance member who later
died of an apparent drug overdose in California, told The
Associated Press that the plane landed at Ilopango Air Force Base
in El Salvador. The arms were stored there for several weeks, he
said, and then sent on to Contra troops in northern Costa Rica.

<HEAD>Kuwait Will Seek Jets Elsewhere If Congress Blocks F-18 Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>

   Kuwait will seek arms from other countries if U.S.
lawmakers refuse to sell 40 F-18 jet fighters to the Arab nation,
Kuwait's foreign minister said today.
   ``We have a variety of alternatives in case the U.S. Congress
blocks the deal,'' Sheik Sabah Ahmed Sabah told reporters. ``We are
not obliged to purchase our needs from the United States. But what
we seek is good quality.''
   The tiny, oil-rich Persian Gulf state, which borders the
Iran-Iraq war zone and is seeking to upgrade its air defenses, has
been attacked and threatened by the fundamentalist regime of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which accuses it of aiding Iraq.
   Sabah's statement coincided with a report that Kuwait was
drawing $5.5 billion from its petrodollar reserves to buy new
weapons.
   He added: ``Kuwait's policy is based on the diversification of
weaponry sources regardless of the manufacturing country.''
   Kuwait bought Strela anti-aircraft missiles from the Soviet
Union in 1984 after Congress blocked the sale of U.S.-made Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles.
   Congress has blocked other plans by the administration to sell
advanced fighter jets, missiles and other hardware to Arab
countries on the grounds they could be used against Israel.
   Congress is expected to decide next month whether to approve or
reject the $2 billion sale.
   The sale of the F-18, the United States' most sophisticated
fighter-bomber, would be the first to an Arab country. Only Canada,
Australia and Spain have purchased the aircraft.

<HEAD>Intellectuals Call For Reappraisal of Late President's Role</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of prominent intellectuals
has issued the strongest statement yet calling for a reappraisal of
Josip Broz Tito's role in leading the country into its worst social
and economic crisis.
   The 19-member Committee in Defense of Intellectual Freedoms, in
a statement to the Yugoslav leadership, also called for an end to
official veneration of the late president, the founder of Communist
Yugoslavia who died in May 1980.
   A copy of the statement, received by the Associated Press on
Wednesday, said Tito is responsible for creating an undemocratic,
repressive political system ``which has thwarted progressive
development of the society.''
   ``Tito's role in making crucial political decisions and his
absolute power in shaping Yugoslav policies were so great that the
present-day position of the country _ and particularly its current
deep social crisis _ cannot be understood or explained without a
comprehensive and objective, scientific and critical reappraisal of
his historical responsibility,'' the statement said.
   Tito was the undisputed leader of Yugoslavia for 35 years until
his death. In spite of growing public disapprobation, criticism of
his policies is still considered a criminal offense.
   In addition to rising ethnic tensions, Yugoslavia is faced with
a $21 billion foreign debt, 170 percent inflation, 15 percent
unemployment, dropping living standards and growing labor unrest.
   The influential unofficial group, consisting of a number of
prominent university professors, authors, artists and scientists,
issues regular statements on political issues, but observers said
they could not recall previous instances where Tito's policies were
questioned in such a way.
   ``There can be no way out of the present economic, political and
moral crisis affecting Yugoslav society without a thorough critical
evaluation of past Yugoslav policies,'' the statement said.
   The constitution adopted in 1974 under Tito is generally blamed
for the country's woes. It granted wide autonomy to the six often
factious republics and two provinces.
   The statement called for a ``dispassionate'' assessment of
Tito's role in the government's repressive measures against
dissidents, particularly against those incarcerated on ``one of
modern Europe's most sinister prison camps _ Goli Otok.''
   Goli Otok, an island off the central Adriatic coast, was used as
an internment camp for alleged opponents of the government after
Yugoslavia's break with the Soviet bloc in the late 1940s.
   Several thousand are said to have died in detention from ill
treatment by prison authorities.
   The statement criticized Tito's non-aligned foreign policy for
having ``isolated our country from its natural cultural,
historical, economic and political surrounding'' in Europe.
   Tito was one of the founders of the non-aligned movement in the
late 1950s and early 1960s.
   Instead of paving the way for Yugoslavia's political and
economic integration in western Europe, the focus of Tito's foreign
policies remained exclusively on Africa and Asia, the statement
said.
   The forum also criticized Tito's lavish lifestyle, demanding to
know ``the real costs of his rule.''

<TEXT>
   Stevie Wonder says he is serious about becoming
mayor of Detroit.
   Not right away, mind you, but whenever Coleman Young, the
long-serving mayor, is ready to step aside, the Motown recording
star says he could step into the world of big-city politics.
   ``I think he could do a good job, too,'' Young, a Wonder fan,
said when told of the singer's political aspirations during an
appearance in Boston with likely Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis.
   The one-time child prodigy floated the Wonder-for-mayor idea in
an interview Tuesday on Detroit radio station WJLB-FM.
   ``I hope someday, and this is really going to shock you, ...
someday I probably will think about running for mayor of this city,
straight out,'' Wonder, 38, told talk show host John Mason.
   Mason, a friend of Wonder who ran into the singer in Detroit at
the closed circuit airing of the Mike Tyson-Michael Spinks
heavyweight boxing fight, laughed and asked Wonder if he was
serious.
   ``I'm very serious,'' he replied.
   Wonder, however, said he has no immediate plans to challenge
Young, whose term expires in 1989.
   ``Coleman, don't worry,'' Wonder said. ``Not yet.''
   Young, 70, has been mayor since 1974 and has shown no
indications of relinquishing the job. Asked if he had decided
whether he would run again, Young said, ``If I have, I haven't
announced it.''
   Wonder said he believes solutions exist to the problems of drug
abuse, teen-age gangs and the breakdown of the family structure,
but ``people really have not attacked those problems. I do believe
problems have solutions.''
   Wonder, who was born in Saginaw and raised in Detroit, achieved
his first success in the music business in Detroit and still
records for the Motown label, now based in Los Angeles. Its sale to
MCA Inc. was announced Tuesday.
   His hits include ``Sir Duke,'' ``Isn't She Lovely?'' and ``You
Are the Sunshine of My Life.''

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's parliament, expected to make
significant changes in the government and discuss economic reforms,
began meeting for the first time today under new Premier Karoly
Grosz.
   Grosz led a new generation of communist leaders into power
during a national party conference last month.
   During the opening day of its spring session, members of
parliament elected Bruno F. Straub as president, a largely
ceremonial post. Straub had been virtually assured parliamentary
approval after he was nominated last week by the communist party's
Central Committee.
   The conference marks the end of Janos Kadar's 32-year leadership
of Hungary and paves the way for sweeping economic reforms Grosz
and other officials say are necessary to overcome economic
stagnation and cope with the highest per capita foreign debt in
Eastern Europe.
   Grosz replaced Kadar as party chief last month.
   ``The Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers'
party and the National Council of the Patriotic People's Front
forwarded joint personnel proposals on filling leading posts of the
presidential council,'' the news agency MTI said in a terse report
in announcing the session opening.
   Grosz became premier in June 1987 and won international
recognition for his determination to push through a program of
unpopular austerity measures, including the introduction of
personal income and value-added taxes.
   However, Grosz has said in recent interviews that his government
has failed so far to revitalize the stagnant economy.
   Proposed government changes at the current session include the
creation of a new Cabinet position, minister of state, for Imre
Pozsgay, a key advocate of political change to accompany economic
reforms.
   He is to be entrusted with as yet unspecified tasks that are
likely to include overseeing reforms.
   Soviet bloc parliaments traditionally rubber-stamp party
decisions, but Hungarian parliament sessions have increasingly been
marked by intensive debate since some non-party candidates were
allowed to run for the assembly in 1985.
   Straub, 74, replaced Karoly Nemeth, 67, who has been officially
on sick leave since June 1. Nemeth was dropped from the Politburo
in May.

   The Supreme Court, refusing to give new
protection to crime victims, today severely limited state efforts
to shield young sex abuse victims when they testify at criminal
trials.
   The justices, voting 6-2, overturned the conviction of an Iowa
man sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually molesting two
13-year-old girls.
   The court said the defendant's rights to a fair trial and to
confront his accusers appear to have been violated by the use of a
one-way screen that was placed in front of him at trial to prevent
the children from seeing him.
   The decision could jeopardize other efforts to protect
witnesses, such as videotaped testimony.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said such one-way
screens violate a defendant's right to confront his accusers.
   ``It is difficult to imagine a more obvious or damaging
violation of the defendant's right to a face-to-face encounter,' he
said.
   Scalia said the defendant's rights were not outweighed ``by the
necessity of protecting victims of sexual abuse.''
   Most states have approved the use of some form of protective
device in child abuse cases when young witnesses testify.
   Today's case stems from the conviction of John Avery Coy on sex
molesting charges.
   A screen was placed in front of Coy in court to shield the girls
from seeing him when they testified. Prosecutors said the device,
which allowed Coy to see the girls, was intended to safeguard the
children from possible emotional trauma.
   A state law presumed children under 14 would be traumatized in
such situations.
   But Coy's lawyers said the screen made a guilty verdict
practically inevitable by creating a presumption he was guilty.
They also said the screen deprived Coy of confronting the girls
face to face, violating a constitutional right intended to yield
honest testimony.
   The lawyers said the screen was particularly prejudicial because
in order for it to function properly the courtroom was darkened and
a panel of bright lights was directed at the device.
   Coy's lawyers said there was no evidence the girls were in
danger of being traumatized.
   They also argued that the judge in the case mistakenly may have
believed the state law compelled him either to order the one-way
screen or to have the girls testify outside the courtroom on
closed-circuit television.
   Prosecutors initially asked the judge to permit the girls to
testify via closed circuit TV. Coy's lawyers objected to the
request. The judge overruled the objection but then ordered the
screen used.
   The screen resembled an oversize school blackboard.
   The Iowa Supreme Court, in upholding Coy's conviction, said the
judge was not obligated to determine that the screen was necessary
or that it served a compelling state interest.
   The children were attacked while they were in a makeshift tent
in their backyard, adjacent to Coy's home. They were unable to
identify their assailant, who was masked and shined a flashlight at
them.
   There was circumstantial evidence that led police to charge Coy
with the attack, including testimony by the girls that their
attacker wore his watch midway up his arm with the face turned
inward. Coy was under arrest on an unrelated charge when police
came to suspect him of the attack on the girls.
   The Supreme Court has ruled previously that stigmatizing
defendants in certain ways may violate their rights. For example,
the court has struck down such practices as requiring defendants to
wear shackles, leg irons or prison uniforms while appearing in
court.
   But the justices have held even inherently prejudicial courtroom
procedures may be allowed when they promote an essential state
policy.
   The court sent today's case back to the Iowa courts for further
hearings.
   The justices said the conviction against Coy could be reinstated
only if the lower courts determine that the use of the one-way
screen was a ``harmless error'' and there is proof beyond a
reasonable doubt Coy would have been convicted even if the screen
had not been used.
   Dissentimg were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Harry A.
Blackmun. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not take part in the case.
   The case is Coy vs. Iowa, 86-6757.

   Israel and the United States today are signing
an agreement to develop and produce jointly a new surface-to-air
missile to counter a growing Arab missile and chemical weapons
arsenal.
   The agreement is being signed at the Pentagon by Gen. David
Ivry, director general of the Israeli defense ministry, and Lt.
Gen. James Abrahamson, director of the U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative Organization.
   The signing follows a statement of concern issued Tuesday by
President Reagan after a meeting at the White House with Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The president said he was troubled
by ``ominous new military developments'' in the area.
   Rabin, during two days of talks here, has stressed Soviet
deliveries of new missiles to Syria and Libya, and Chinese
shipments to Saudi Arabia.
   The Israeli official flew up to Boston late Monday for a
45-minute meeting with Michael Dukakis, who is expected to win the
Democratic presidential nomination. The substance of their
conversation was not divulged.
   After a speech today at the National Press Club and the signing
ceremony at the Pentagon, Rabin was to fly to Huntsville, Ala., to
inspect U.S. space and other military facilities there.
   The Reagan administration reassured Rabin on Tuesday of the U.S.
commitment to Israel's security but scolded him for the use of
violence to quell Palestinian disturbances in the occupied
territories.
   Summarizing Rabin's talks here with Reagan, Vice President
George Bush and top administration officials, the White House said
Tuesday that the U.S. government ``reaffirmed America's commitment
to Israel's security.''
   But in a detailed account of the private talks between staunch
allies, the White House said Rabin had been told Israel should show
more flexibility in the push for a Middle East peace settlement and
less inclination toward violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The stern words were accompanied by a U.S. promise to sign a
memorandum of understanding for joint American-Israeli development
of an anti-ballistic missile in response to ``ominous new military
developments in the region.''
   Rabin, following his talks with Reagan, Bush, Secretary of State
George Shultz, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and national
security adviser Colin D. Powell, pronounced himself satisfied.
   In perhaps its harshest condemnation yet of violence in the
territories, the White House said in a statement: ``Neither should
violence nor controls on violence become ends in themselves, making
a political solution more difficult.
   ``Realism and a willingness to nurture rather than reject
possible opportunities for peace are essential, as is a climate
that makes negotiations possible,'' it said.
   Although Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the Labor
Party have expressed general support for the U.S. peace initiative.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has shown little enthusiasm for it.
   The administration has been reluctant to criticize Israel's use
of force against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where 210 Palestinians and four Israeli settlers have been
killed since Arab unrest began in December.
   In its statement, the White House said: ``While Israel should
not be expected to make concessions under the threat of violence,
the preservation of order in the territories must neither provide a
justification for civilian lawlessness nor act as an excuse for
avoiding political discourse with the Palestinians of the West Bank
and Gaza.''
   Rabin told reporters he was ``going back home quite satisfied''
with his expectations of continued U.S. aid.
   ``The framework of the support will be basically the same,'' he
said. ``We also are aware of other problems that the United States
faces; we know of the problems about foreign aid bills and about
the defense bills.
   ``As long as we will be able to keep in reality the same level
of support, we are satisfied.''
   Israel, the largest single recipient of U.S. aid, is receiving
about $3 billion in total military and economic assistance this
fiscal year. Legislation before Congress calls for an identical
appropriation in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   Rabin said the two sides discussed ways of reducing
proliferation of ground-to-ground missiles in the Middle East and
of neutralizing damage from the weapons.
   The new anti-ballistic missile is intended to counter this
threat. The White House said the American contribution will be
about 80 percent and the Israeli contribution 20 percent.

   Delegates to a nationwide Communist Party
conference today clashed over the pace of economic reforms in the
Soviet Union, with local managers saying the reforms had not gone
far enough to help the stagnant economy.
   The conference, the party's first in 47 years, also ordered an
investigation into a Soviet magazine's charge that some delegates
from the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan were involved in
corruption.
   Reports in the official media on the second day of the
conference indicated debate was shifting from political questions
to the economy, with the opening day's presentation by economist
Leonid Abalkin at the center of the debate.
   Abalkin, head of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Economics
Institute and a top adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, told the 5,000
delegates that the Soviet economy is not improving because it still
measures its progress by quantity rather than quality of products.
   But Georgy Arbatov, head of the Institute of the U.S.A. and
Canada and a member of the policy-making Central Committee, said he
``totally disagreed'' with Abalkin, Tass reported.
   The conference, the 19th in party history, was convened by
Gorbachev to review changes he has made since rising to power in
March 1985 and to consider further steps he said are needed to
modernize the country. The delegates are meeting behind closed
doors in the Kremlin, and only official Soviet media are permitted
to cover the proceedings.
   The official Tass news agency said Arbatov told delegates the
Soviet Union had made great progress in ``creating the political,
spiritual and moral preconditions for the economic reform.''
   But Y.A. Smirnov, manager of a chemical factory in the Ural
Mountain city of Nizhnitagilsk, complained that he had heard
nothing that would help him improve the work of his factory.
   ``I generally expected to hear much more _ how to transform it,
what kinds of tactics to use, what stages, what frontiers,'' he
said in an interview with Soviet television.
   Addressing Abalkin in his television interview, Smirnov said:
``You are the economic institute. You should map this strategy.
Abalkin said it's necessary, but did not say how to do it. The fate
of perestroika depends on it.''
   V.A. Yarin, a senior machine operator at a metallurgy factory in
Nizhnitagilsk, said government ministers should get out of the
``fashionable halls'' of the Kremlin to make their reports in
working-class districts.
   Abalkin said rigid central planning of production quotas made it
impossible to ``solve the problems of a radical improvement in the
quality of output, technical re-equipment of the national economy,
enhancing its efficiency, making the economy face the consumer.''
   F. V. Popov, party leader in the Siberian Altai region, drew his
fellow delegates' attention to the latest issue of the weekly
Ogonyok magazine, which accused some Uzbek delegates of involvement
in corruption.
   Ogonyok said several ``bribetakers'' had been elected to the
conference from the republic.
   The delegates asked the credentials commission, which previously
had certified all delegates, to investigate the charge.
   Tass said that Georgy Razumovsky, chairman of the conference's
credentials commission, opened today's session with a report that
some delegates were elected by their party organizations without
popular support.
   But he said established procedures were followed and the
commission had certified the election of all delegates, Tass
reported.
   During the election campaign to select the delegates, prominent
advocates of Gorbachev's reforms charged that middle-level party
bureaucrats were naming conservative allies as delegates at the
expense of the reformers.
   On Tuesday, delegates moved to restrict their debate after one
speaker was hounded for straying from the subject at hand, the
official media reported.
   The conference is considering the broad blueprint for political
reform that Gorbachev presented to its opening session on Tuesday.
   In a 3{-hour televised speech, Gorbachev proposed creating a
powerful full-time legislature and a presidency with powers akin to
many Western heads of state.
   But the proposals left many questions unanswered about the
future role of the party and its general secretary, the post
Gorbachev holds.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, said delegates began clapping
``in protest'' on Tuesday when a Moscow party official, V.
Belyaninov, strayed from the agenda during his speech.
   Tass said the conference then adopted a rule limiting speeches
so delegates would not waste time. It did not mention what
Belyaninov said, but the rule prohibits delegates from reporting on
their own activities or congratulating the chamber on its conduct
of the discussion.

   President Reagan today branded likely Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis a ``true liberal'' who would
raise taxes and ``restore the heavy hand of government'' in
American lives.
   In his most direct attack yet on the Massachusetts governor who
is virtually assured of opposing Vice President George Bush in the
fall election, Reagan told a Republican Party fund-raising event
``the sad truth is that whenever liberals talk about `reducing the
deficit,' it's just a code word for boosting taxes.''
   ``The $64 billion question is this: Should we expect that if the
Democrats' all-but-certain presidential candidate is elected that
he would raise taxes?'' the president asked. ``In fact, he just
did.''
   Reagan, making an appearance on behalf of Rep. Connie Mack III,
who is seeking the Republican nomination for the Senate seat being
vacated by Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., said that in the last five
years, Dukakis ``has increased Massachusetts' state spending at
double the rate of federal spending.''
   Although the growth in federal spending has been slowed during
the Reagan years and the deficit has been cut, largely through the
Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing act and a deal Reagan struck with
congressional leaders last fall, the president has presided over
the largest federal budget deficits in history. Reagan has blamed
Congress for that, even though he has never submitted a balanced
budget to Capitol Hill.
   In making the trip to Miami today, Reagan inadvertently put
himself in the middle of a Republican primary fight in Florida.
   The president, who follows a policy of not interfering in
primary contests, accepted the speaking date weeks ago on the
assumption that Mack, grandson of the legendary baseball manager,
would be unopposed in the Sept. 6 Florida primary.
   On Monday, however, U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, the prosecutor
who obtained a drug indictment against Panamanian Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, resigned his federal post and jumped into the race.
   In his speech to the fund-raising luncheon, Reagan noted Mack's
connection to baseball and said that ``next year, thanks to you,
Washington will have a new winning team, and I mean real major
leaguers: Sen. Connie Mack and President George Bush.''
   ``What the 1988 elections are all about is whether we continue
to build on that progress and move ahead to an even brighter
future, or whether he hesitate and return to those worn-out
policies that bring high taxes, low growth and a loss of direction
and purpose,'' he said.
   ``And each time the people have made the same decision: to
continue in the direction of economic freedom, entrepreneurship and
individual opportunity,'' he said. ``And to move away from the
heavy hand of government which seeks to control the people and the
economy.''
   ``So, yes, the man expected to head up the Democratic ticket
that Connie faces is a true liberal who, instead of controlling
government spending, raises taxes,'' Reagan said.
   On another subject, the president vowed that he would make no
concessions with Cuba's Fidel Castro to warm relations between the
United States and the island nation.
   ``There is an unbridgeable gulf between the governments of the
United States and Cuba,'' he said. ``It is the gulf between freedom
and tyranny. And as far as this administration is concerned,
freedom for Cuba, liberty for her people, is a non-negotiable
demand.''
   Mark Mills, communications director for the Mack campaign, said
Reagan wanted to go ahead with his appearance despite Merkle's
entry into the GOP primary race.
   ``The president gave his word and his commitment to support
Connie Mack and I just think the president is following through on
that,'' he said.
   The president's visit is expected to garner about $800,000.
Mills said Reagan would pose for photographs with people who have
raised at least $10,000 for the campaign or the state Republican
Party, and then speak at a luncheon. Luncheon tickets were $500 or
$1,000, depending on where the seats were.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the extent of
Reagan's campaigning for Bush, the apparent GOP nominee for
president, ``will all be firmed up in the next few weeks.''

<HEAD>Four More Aides to Deposed President Manigat Released</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Four aides to deposed President
Leslie Manigat were released from jail after a one-week
incarceration, Radio Haiti Inter reported today.
   Roger Savain and his son Roger Jr. were set free from the
political prison Fort Dimanche on Tuesday afternoon, the station
reported. It said two other other former Manigat aides, Jean-Yves
Noel and Narcaisse Lescouflair, also were freed.
   The elder Savain had been Manigat's information minister. The
station didn't say what roles the others held in Manigat's
government.
   The four said in an interview on state-run television that they
were treated well in jail. It was unclear whether charges ever were
filed, whether the four were interrogated, or whether they were
simply locked up.
   Capt. Isidore Pongnon, commander of Fort Dimanche, told Haiti
Inter that ``seven or eight'' more aides to the deposed president
still were being held but would soon be released.
   More than a dozen aides and advisers to Manigat, including at
least three U.S. citizens, were arrested in the hours after Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy installed himself in the National Palace on June
19.
   Two days earlier, Manigat had fired Namphy, at the time the
army's commander-in-chief, and placed him under house arrest.
   On Tuesday, the government announced the release of four former
Manigat aides. The government identified them as U.S. citizens
Robert Benodin, Frantz Jean-Louis and Jean Bogart; and Harry
Carrenard, a Haitian-Canadian with double nationality.
   Carrenard was Manigat's minister of social affairs.
   Those still under arrest include Lionel Desgranges, Manigat's
former chief of staff.

   Storms cheered by thousands at a major-league baseball game in
Kansas City brought desperately needed rain to the drought-battered
Midwest today, but forecasters said much more was needed.
   ``You talk about a $1 million rain _ this is a $100 million
rain,'' extension agent Vance Haugen in northeast Wisconsin's
Shawano County said as the storms began Tuesday. ``We're very
happy. We're out dancing in it.''
   Meanwhile, the president of the American Farm Bureau charged
that the drought's severity is being exaggerated by the media and
politicians.
   ``The national media never met a disaster they didn't like,,''
Dean Kleckner said during a news conference at Colorado State
University as part of a tour of four Western states.
   ``The nightly network news (media) have made up their minds. The
story is: no crops in the country, a complete disaster, higher food
prices,'' he said.
   Politicians are hoping to take advantage of the drought crisis
in an election year, he claimed. The Farm Bureau is a private,
non-profit federation with 3.5 million members.
   Tuesday's rainfall was the first significant precipitation for
the Chicago area since May 23, the National Weather Service said.
   The worst drought to hit America's midsection since the Dust
Bowl has withered crops, dried up water supplies, halted barge
traffic on shrunken rivers and sparked forest fires.
   A record 1.67 inches of rain fell Tuesday in Madison, Wis.,
where the old mark of 1.62 inches was set in 1928. In six hours
overnight, more than 3 inches fell in Oklahoma City, where streets
were up to 3 feet deep in water. Omaha, Neb., got 2.6 inches
overnight and Lacrosse, Wis., got 2 inches.
   In Michigan, however, Traverse City Farm Bureau agent John
Amrhein said: ``The rain we got ... was almost nothing. Wasn't even
enough really to settle the dust.''
   ``It definitely helps, but probably a lot more will be needed to
really change the situation,'' the weather service's Hugh Crowther
said from Kansas City, Mo.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended today from the High
Plains to the mid-Mississippi Valley.
   When light rain began falling Tuesday in the bottom of the ninth
of the White Sox-Royals game in Kansas City, the 27,000 spectators
broke into sustained applause. But the rain lasted only a few
minutes, and the Royals lost 4-3.
   Despite the rain, temperatures in the 100s seared sections of
the Midwest. It was 101 degrees in Kansas City, where the old
record of 94 was set in 1978. Temperatures hit 105 in Sioux Falls,
S.D., 1 degree higher than the 1931 record.
   Triple-digit temperatures caused part of Interstate 20 in
central Mississippi to buckle more than 4 feet, triggering a
collision between two cars and a tractor-trailer rig, officials
said. No serious injuries were reported.
   Last week's heat severely stressed crops and blotted up soil
moisture in most of the nation's eastern half, the government's
Joint Agricultural Weather Facility reported Tuesday.
   ``Corn, cotton, soybeans, sorghum and spring wheat conditions
continued declining'' the week of June 20-26, the unit said. ``The
lack of moisture may prevent some recently planted soybeans and
sorghum from emerging.''
   Pastures were rated poor to very poor, and farmers culled herds
as pasture and hay supplies dropped, the report said.
   Vice President George Bush, the Republican party's apparent
presidential nominee, was to attend a livestock auction in Marion,
Wis., today, to call attention to the farmers' plight.
   In Washington, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, meeting with
Ohio's congressional delegation, resisted a request from Democratic
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum the department expedite disaster
assessments. Such assessments would be a step toward making farmers
eligible for low-interest loans.
   ``Most farmers you would ask say they don't know what kind of
crop they're going to have, on the 28th of June,'' Lyng said. ``And
I think it would be very dangerous for us to start making these
loans ... for just political reasons,'' he said.
   In other developments:
   _The Coast Guard tightened restrictions on barge traffic on the
Lower Mississippi. Northbound towboats will be limited to 20
barges, only 12 of which can be loaded, said Cmdr. Michael Donohoe
of the Memphis district. Last week, the Guard imposed a limit of 25
barges per tow, of which 16 could be loaded.
   Limits for southbound towboats remained unchanged at 20 barges,
all of which can be loaded.
   _In Audobon, Iowa, farmer Elmer G. Carlson said he is still
paying for 16 Hopi Indians to fly to Iowa for a rain dance
Saturday. He said today the Indians are still coming, even though
the rain arrived ahead of time.
   _In Kentucky, Billy Bird _ mascot for the Louisville Redbirds
minor league baseball team _ pitched a tent in the stadium and
vowed to remain there until there is a ``good five-minute
downpour.''
   ``The Astroturf is turning brown,'' the mascot said.

   Mr. T, the glittery tough guy of
television, is drawing a steady stream of fans to a courtroom where
his lawsuit against a contractor is being heard.
   Mr. T is suing Kenneth J. Tomkins, owner of Kenlor Development,
who he claims overcharged him for remodeling his mansion in Lake
Forest, north of Chicago on Lake Michigan.
   The trial was in its fourth day today in the courtroom of Lake
County Circuit Judge Stephen E. Walter, whose 10-year-old son
managed to get a photograph signed by the actor.
   The suit stems from the remodeling in late 1986 and early 1987
of Mr. T's estate and included work on bathrooms, interior
painting, and security gates.
   Tomkins contends winter weather slowed his progress and is
countersuing over the $168,000 project. Tomkins claims the actor
owes him nearly $18,000, including the cost of a company sign Mr. T
angrily ripped down.
   Mr. T, wearing blue-striped overalls minus his trademark gold
jewelry, said work crews cemented the fence posts improperly and
failed to stain the wooden fence. The sign insulted him, he said.
   ``I was really hot, so I grabbed the sign and tore it down,'' he
said.
   Mr. T played Sgt. Bosco ``B.A.'' Baracus in the television
adventure series ``The A-Team.''

<HEAD>Two U.S. Soldiers And Ex-Serviceman Convicted Of Smuggling Cocaine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two U.S. soldiers and an
ex-serviceman have been convicted of smuggling 18 pounds of cocaine
from Panama into U.S. territory on a military transport plane.
   The three were convicted Tuesday after three hours of
deliberations by a federal jury and will be sentenced Oct. 6. They
face jail terms ranging from 10 to 99 years.
   The two servicemen, Franklyn Milton Browne, 19, of the New York
City borough of Queens, and Darrin Taylor, 19, of Chicago, Ill.,
were arrested Jan. 30 at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station on the
east coast of this U.S. Commonwealth and charged with three counts
of importing and possessing cocaine.
   The cocaine was found in their luggage during a routine Customs
check when the Military Air Command flight stopped in Puerto Rico
on its way to the mainland from Howard Air Force Base in Panama.
   Billy Ray McDowell, an ex-serviceman from Forth Worth, Texas,
was allegedly one of the soldiers' U.S. contacts. He was arrested
after federal officials monitored phone calls the two allegedly
made to arrange to deliver the cocaine.
   Two other men, a native of Panama traveling with false army
documents and another U.S. soldier, were arrested on the same
flight for smuggling cocaine into U.S. territory.
   The U.S. soldier, Bruce Morris Mack, 20, of Gary, Ind., was
convicted of smuggling 37 pounds of cocaine and is serving a
10-year jail term; the Panamanian, Rafael Valladares, 29, was
convicted of smuggling 35 pounds of cocaine and is still awaiting
sentencing. Officials said the two were working independently of
each other and of Browne and Taylor.

   The Defense Department's chief purchasing
official today defended his attempt last month to give top Pentagon
political appointees the power to veto searches of the private
contractors who supply military equipment.
   Robert Costello, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, told
the House Armed Services Committee he wrote the memo after a
contractor's office in St. Louis had been searched. Costello said
he didn't object to the search, but said it should not have been
conducted without a prior review at the upper levels of the
Pentagon.
   ``The system at that point had been short-circuited,'' Costello
said. ``The people at the local level had taken, perhaps, overly
aggressive actions. If the system had been allowed to function as
it was constructed to function ... the access to the information
could have been achieved without resort to the use of force.''
   The May 5 memo was written before the public ever learned of a
two-year nationwide investigation into allegedly corrupt Pentagon
contracting. The Associated Press obtained the memo Tuesday.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the committee, told Costello
that ``the memo itself sends the wrong signal'' to defense
contractors. ``The whole tenor of that (the memo) is awfully
sympathetic to defense contractors.''
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci rejected the proposal,
perceiving it as ``interference in the conduct of criminal
investigations,'' Air Force Col. David J. Shea, a Pentagon
spokesman, said Tuesday.
   The plan could have curtailed a crucial tool for investigators
seeking evidence that top-secret Pentagon information was sold to
private consultants, who then sold it to contractors. About three
dozen searches have been conducted so far.
   The Costello-to-Carlucci memo complained that Defense Department
investigators had executed a search last February in a
``sensational'' manner by using some two dozen law enforcement
officers and failing to give the company prior notice. That
particular search was part of a fraud investigation, but was
apparently unrelated to the nationwide probe.
   Initially, Carlucci sent Costello a note saying, ``This is a
good idea,'' Shea said.
   But Shea insisted Tuesday the note referred only to Costello's
suggestion that Pentagon investigators be trained to obtain
evidence ``in the least forceful and sensational manner.''
   Shea said Carlucci ``doesn't want to be associated with''
Costello's proposal that a ``review and approval'' system be
established for search warrants.
   ``The appropriate level of review and-or approval should at
least be (Deputy Secretary of Defense) Will Taft or myself, and
quite possibly yourself,'' Costello wrote.
   On Tuesday, a Justice Department official confirmed that
Attorney General Edwin Meese III has removed himself from the
investigation, because his own lawyers represent figures in the
Pentagon case.
   Earlier in the day, Meese had spoken about the case at length
during a news conference, but never mentioned that he had withdrawn
from it.
   Meese spokesman Patrick Korten later confirmed that the attorney
general had recused himself. Korten said Meese didn't mention it
because ``there wasn't any particular reason to mention it.''
   At the news conference, Meese said he thinks Congress is to
blame for creating an atmosphere conducive to scandal at the
Pentagon. He said Congress puts ``layers of requirements'' on
Pentagon officials and ignores budget planning cycles, leading
contractors to say, ``We've got to get ours now.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said he agrees there are too many regulations, but many came from
within the Pentagon rather than from Congress. In any event, he
said, that is no excuse for ``pure old fraud, waste and greed.''
   In other developments:
   _Former Navy Secretary James H. Webb said investigators told him
last fall that Navy official-turned-consultant Melvyn Paisley and
an unidentified member of Webb's headquarters staff were under
investigation.
   _The Washington Post reported today that the Defense Department
is reviewing six previously closed fraud investigations, to see if
they should be re-opened in light of the new allegations. Pentagon
Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said her office is reviewing any
past cases involving individuals or companies whose names have come
up in the current investigation.
   _The FBI said it searched the home of Richard Seelmeyer, who was
an aide to the late Rep. Joseph P. Addabbo, D-N.Y. Seelmeyer is now
publisher of Capitol Hill Defense Digest, a newsletter about
military matters; Addabbo, who died in April 1986, was chairman of
the House subcommittee on Defense Department appropriations.
   Costello's suggestion for the search warrant review was rejected
not only by Carlucci but by Brown, the Pentagon inspector general,
according to a Pentagon source, speaking only on condition he not
be named.
   The source said Ms. Brown ``indicated to Mr. Carlucci the
Department of Justice will not accept a procedure whereby use of
search warrants by defense criminal investigative organizations
would require concurrence of any official outside the office of
inspector general.''
   Costello's anger was triggered by a Feb. 25 search at the
Electronic & Space Division of Emerson Electric Co. near St. Louis.
   The search was partly based on an affidavit by John E. Lake, an
agent of the Defense Criminal Investigation Service. The company
responded with a lawsuit asking that the search be declared
unconstitutional.
   In court papers filed by Emerson, the company said government
agents lied or left out important information when they asked for a
search warrant.
   Lake's affidavit said that in October, he began investigating
``fraudulent billings for contracts performed for the Department of
Defense.''
   Authorities alleged that Emerson violated federal law by billing
the government for parts that were installed on vehicles the
company was making for Egypt under a separate contract.
   Costello complained in his memo that ``only minimal
consideration was given to executing the search warrant in a less
sensational manner.''
   ``To send 19 DCIS agents, one customs agent, and several
Missouri state troopers directly to the plant appears to me to be
an unwarranted show of force that invites sensational treatment in
the press,'' he wrote.

   Foreign Minister Pik Botha
said today a Cuban and Angolan raid on South African forces in
southern Angola could threaten peace talks to end the 13-year-old
Angolan civil war.
   South African soldiers protecting a dam killed more than 300
Angolan and Cuban troops who launched a land and air attack Monday,
South African military headquarters said. It said 12 South Africans
were killed.
   The 12 deaths were the country's highest fatality count in a
single battle in Angola during the past year. Col. John Rolt of the
South African Defense Force described the battle as one of the
biggest South African-Cuban clashes since Cuban troops arrived in
1975 to support Angola's Marxist government.
   The battle occurred at a dam outside Calueque, about 30 miles
north of the border with South-West Africa, the territory
administered by South Africa.
   The South African military said 11 of its soldiers were killed
by a bomb dropped from a Soviet-made MiG fighter plane. The 12th
soldier was killed in the ground skirmish that left 300 Cubans and
Angolans dead, the military said.
   South Africa has long protected the dam, which supplies water to
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. The dam wall was damaged,
electricity to the wall was cut off and a water pipeline was
destroyed, the military said.
   Botha said the attack ``confirms Cuba's aggressive intentions,''
adding that additional raids could undermine ongoing peace talks.
   South Africa, Angola, Cuba and the United States have held three
rounds of peace talks since May, including discussions that
concluded last weekend in Cairo, Egypt. A fourth round is scheduled
next month in the United States.
   The talks have focused on withdrawing all foreign troops from
Angola and bringing independence to Namibia. The talks have not
produced any concrete results, but all sides have described the
meetings as productive.
   ``I cannot at this stage predict how the events at Calueque will
affect the further course of the discussions,'' Botha said in a
statement released early today. ``However, should this trend
continue, it will serve no purpose to hold further discussions.''
   Botha said South African protection of the Calueque dam was
discussed in May at peace talks in Brazzaville, Congo.
   ``The impression was left that (Angola) understood the position
and would ensure that ... Calueque would not become the scene of
military intervention by the Cubans,'' Botha said.
   ``The clash at Calueque confirms the South African government's
suspicion that the Cuban command in Angola ignores the Angolan
government ... and possibly also the (Cuban) political
representatives who participated in the discussions,'' Botha added.
   South Africa has said that during the past year it has had up to
3,000 troops in Angola supporting the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), a pro-Western rebel movement.
UNITA, which also receives military aid from the United States, has
been fighting since 1975 for a power-sharing agreement.
   Angola claims there are 9,000 South African troops inside its
borders. The Angolan government, meanwhile, is backed by more than
40,000 Cuban troops and an estimated 1,000 Soviet advisers.
   In recent weeks, South Africa and UNITA said the Cubans and
Angolans had moved at least 15,000 fresh troops to southern Angola,
along the border with Namibia. The Angolans said the troop
movements were to match South African activity in the area.
   South Africa traditionally has crossed into Angola from
South-West Africa in pursuit of guerrillas of the South-West
African People's Organization.
   The guerrilla group has been fighting for 21 years to end South
African control of the territory. The rebels often launch their
periodic raids from bases in southern Angola.

<HEAD>Reagan Blasts Dukakis; Dukakis Talks Over Veep Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis got down to serious talk about a
running mate today, beginning private meetings at the Capitol with
senators including some mentioned as possible candidates, while
President Reagan joined the campaign fray by blasting Dukakis as a
liberal sure to raise taxes.
   Vice President George Bush, the likely Republican presidential
nominee, said today in a foreign policy speech in San Francisco
that sweeping changes being proposed by Soviet Leader Mikhail
Gorbachev should be viewed with optimism, but he added, ``The cold
war is not over.''
   In a speech to the World Affairs Council, the vice president
credited America's military buildup for a change in Soviet
thinking. ``My point is that it was eight years of American
strength that confronted the Soviet Union with the true costs of
aggression and the necessity of reform,'' Bush said.
   Reagan, in remarks prepared for delivery at a GOP fund-raising
event in Miami, referred to Dukakis, though never mentioning him by
name, as a ``true liberal.'' And he said, ``The sad truth is that
whenever liberals talk about `reducing the deficit,' it's just a
code word for boosting taxes.''
   ``The $64 billion question is this: Should we expect that if the
Democrats' all-but-certain presidential candidate is elected that
he would raise taxes?'' the president asked. ``In fact, he just
did.''
   Dukakis recently signed a cigarette tax designed to head off a
deficit in the Massachusetts state budget.
   Reagan, taking credit for the 1980s economic revival in
Massachusetts, said Dukakis ``has spent every dime and more of the
revenue generated in his state by the eagan-Bush recovery. And
since 1986, while the federal budget deficit has been cut sharply,
his deficit in Massachusetts has ballooned.''
   The Dukakis administration says the state budget will in fact be
in balance, as mandated by law, at the end of the fiscal year on
Thursday.
   The Massachusetts governor and certain Democratic presidential
nominee also planned to travel to the Midwest late today and, like
Bush, highlight the hardships caused by the long dry spell.
Dukakis, who earlier said he was ``enjoying the process'' of
selecting a running mate, said nothing to reporters as he arrived
at the Capitol today.
   Bush, previewing the foreign policy speech he was to give to the
World Affairs Council in San Francisco today, said Tuesday that
Americans should be ``very, very wary'' about whether Gorbachev's
call for sweeping changes in the Soviet Union actually will lead to
``a fundamental departure from their Marxist system.''
   On the other hand, Bush said Gorbachev should be encouraged to
move ahead with his twin programs of glasnost, or opennesss, and
perestroika, or restructuring.
   In interviews Tuesday, Bush said he was not worried about a
Gallup Poll for the Times Mirror Corp., released this week, which
showed him running 13 points behind Dukakis.
   ``I like to come back,'' he said. ``I think I'm going to win.''
   Bush was heading back to Washington after a brief stopover in
Appleton, Wis.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, was spending today on Capitol Hill in
meetings with as many as 30 Democratic senators. Among them,
perhaps, will be his eventual choice for a vice presidential
nominee.
   Sources say the Dukakis campaign is seeking exhaustive
background information, even driving records, from potential
candidates, to avoid any embarrassing surprises after the ticket
has been set.
   The most recent among the possible candidates reportedly
declining to be considered is Rep. Thomas Foley of Washington, the
House majority leader.
   At a joint appearance Tuesday in Boston with Dukakis, Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., said the ``betting on Capitol Hill seems to be
John Glenn and Lloyd Bentsen as the front-runners'' for the No. 2
spot.
   Dukakis laughed when told that the Ohio or Texas senator was the
sure winner. ``I'm not a betting man,'' he said.
   Republican party sources, meanwhile, said Tuesday that New
Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean has been chosen to deliver the keynote
speech at the Republican National Convention in August in New
Orleans. The selection could be announced as early as today, the
sources said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush was
attracted to the governor's views, outlined in his book ``The
Politics of Inclusion,'' on ways to reach beyond the GOP's
traditional wealthy, white-collar base.
   Although Kean has also been mentioned as a potential running
mate for Bush, Kean said Tuesday, ``I'm doing everything I can to
make sure he doesn't come to me.''
   Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick will be a featured
speaker at the GOP convention, it was announced Tuesday.
Kirkpatrick had endorsed Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole for
president during the primaries.
   Republican party chief Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said there was no
link between the announcement and the Democrats' choice on Monday
of Texas Treasurer Ann Richards as their convention keynote speaker.
   While in California, Bush endorsed the recommendation of
President Reagan's AIDS commission that victims of the deadly
disease should have federal protection from discrimination on the
job, in schools and elsewhere.
   Reagan has yet to take a position on the recommendation, and
Bush supported the president, adding: ``I've got a different role
here. I want to say what I think.''
   Jesse Jackson, in a speech Tueday at the 17th annual convention
of his operation PUSH, said the federal government should be
required to set aside 10 percent of all contracts to businesses
owned by minorities. He also said a Cabinet-level administrator
should be put in charge of making sure affirmative action programs
are enforced.

<HEAD>MEESE BLAMES CONGRESS FOR EXCESSIVE REGULATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said defense contractors that
are targets in the current probe may have adopted an attitude of
``We've got to get ours now'' due to congressionally imposed
``layers of requirements'' on Pentagon officials dealing with the
contractors. But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., disputed Meese's contention,
saying, ``I don't know of any rule or law that's passed that would
entice someone to sell a government secret for money.''

   Meese, who answered reporters' questions about the investigation
Tuesday, had recused himself from the probe the previous day

<HEAD>PENTAGON'S TOP PROCUREMENT OFFICIAL SOUGHT TO LIMIT SEARCHES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Robert Costello, undersecretary of defense for acquisition,
wrote a memo to Carlucci last month asking that top Pentagon
officials be given the authority for prior approval of search
warrants for defense contractor facilities. Costello sought the
authority after investigators on Feb. 25 searched the Electronic &
Space Division of Emerson Electric Co. near St. Louis in a separate
fraud investigation, but Carlucci rejected the idea.
   Testifying today before a House committee, Costello defended the
memo. He said the search he complained about should not have been
undertaken without prior review at the Pentagon. ``The people at
the local level had taken, perhaps, overly aggressive actions,'' he
said.

   Former Navy Secretary James Webb said the Naval Investigative
Service told him last fall that a member of the Navy headquarters
staff and Melvyn Paisley, a former assistant Navy secretary, were
under investigation in the defense fraud case. Webb said officials
told him Paisley was a ``central figure'' in their investigation.
But Webb said he consciously decided not to tell Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci about the probe because he figured authorities
would tell Carlucci when and if they wanted him to know about it.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia has warned Shiite
Moslems that they face Koranic punishments, which include beheading
and crucifixion, if they disrupt this year's pilgrimage in Mecca,
the official Saudi Press Agency reported today.
   The Saudi government said it will punish anyone involved in a
violation of security, including possession of weapons or
explosives, and ``any act of disturbance, terrorism or sabotage
such as demonstrations, slogan-shouting and carrying of posters and
banners, use of loudspeakers and blocking of roads and delaying of
pilgrims from performing the rites,'' the news agency said.
   The statement, issued Tuesday, was clearly aimed at the Shiite
Moslem followers of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who are
among the millions of pilgrims to visit Mecca.
   The annual hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, begins in late July.
   During last year's pilgrimage, more than 400 people, mostly
Iranian Shiites, were killed in riots. Iran accused Saudi security
forces of opening fire on its people.
   The Saudis accused the Iranians of holding demonstrations,
including anti-U.S. protests, in defiance of a ban on political
activity. In April, Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic relations
with Tehran, citing terrorism and subversion.
   The law in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is based on the Koran and
its Islamic code, which allows beheading and crucifixion.
Crucifixion has not been used in years in Saudi Arabia. Other
punishments include the cutting off of hands or feet.
   The Saudis said their warning of Koranic punishment was
triggered by reports from Tehran ``of threats from Khomeini and his
aides to plant some hired agents of different nationalities to
conduct acts of sabotage, including holiganism and atheistic
chantings and other foolish practices ... carried out by the
Revolutionary Guards last year.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, said today that ``the Saudi regime fears a truly Islamic
hajj and holding of demonstrations. It has created obstacles for
Moslems.''
   The Saudis have asked Iran to limit the number of its pilgrims
this year to 45,000 instead of the previous 150,000.
   Iranian leaders have said they will boycott this year's hajj,
but have called on Shiite Moslems from other countries to stage
protests.
   Iran's 44 million people are predominantly Shiite Moslem, while
most of Saudi Arabia's 11 million people belong to the predominant
Sunni sect of Islam. Saudi Arabia said that Iranian Revolutionary
Guards posing as pilgrims tried in 1986 to smuggle explosives
hidden in suitcases into Saudi Arabia to carry out sabotage.
   Crown Prince Abdullah, head of Saudi Arabia's paramilitary
National Guard, has said that authorities ``will not permit any
voice to rise higher than that of the prayers of a worshiper, the
hymns of the devout and adoration of the creator'' this year.

   Two researchers were seriously burned
when a piece of equipment broke and sprayed them with a corrosive
chemical at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, officials said.
   Stanley P. Sander and Valerie Lang, both chemists, were listed
in serious condition today at Sherman Oaks Burn Center, said
spokeswoman Johna Rogozin. ``Their condition really has not changed
at all since yesterday,'' she said.
   The lab was evacuated and sealed following the accident, said
lab spokesman George Alexander. He said results of an inspection to
determine the accident's cause were expected to be completed
sometime today.
   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory runs America's unmanned space
exploration program under contract to the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration. It is operated by the California Institute of
Technology.
   The two researchers were burned by the chemical bromine as they
tried to free a stopped valve in a glass-tubing network. The valve
broke and drops of the chemical splashed onto the skin on their
forearms, hands and wrists, Alexander said.
   The two were working under a safety hood at the time of the
accident in JPL's Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratory.
   The researchers were conducting an experiment into the roles of
bromine and chlorine in formation of the ozone hole in the Earth's
upper atmosphere, Alexander said.

<HEAD>High Court Says Federal Judges May Settle State-Federal Medicaid
Disputes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in an $11.3 million victory
for the state of Massachusetts, ruled today that federal judges
have the power to settle disputes between states and the federal
government involving Medicaid funds.
   The 6-3 ruling reinstated a federal judge's decision that
Massachusetts may recover $11.3 million in Medicaid money to care
for the mentally retarded that the federal government had withheld.
   Medicaid is a joint federal-state program to provide medical
care to the financially needy. States administer the day-to-day
operations and the federal government pays part of the costs,
``reimbursing'' the states in advance.
   From 1978 through 1982, Massachusetts received several hundred
million dollars in federal money as partial reimbursement for
providing medical assistance to the mentally retarded.
   Under regulations adopted by the secretary of Health and Human
Services, Medicaid reimbursements are not available for
``vocational training and educational activities.''
   In two separate audits, federal officials determined that
Massachusetts had obtained Medicaid reimbursements for various
``special education'' services provided to mentally retarded people
living in intermediate care facilities.
   The federal officials disallowed $11.3 million in reimbursements
paid for the five-year period in question, and recovered the money
by withholding some advance Medicaid reimbursements in subsequent
years.
   Massachusetts officials sued HHS Secretary Otis Bowen in a
federal trial court, seeking to recover the $11.3 million and to
bar his agency from failing to reimburse such services in the
future.
   U.S. District Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of Boston ruled in
1985 that the government must make up the $11.3 milion withheld
from Massachusetts.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last March 31 overruled
part of Garrity's decision.
   The appeals court said that, under a federal law called the
Tucker Act, any claim against the federal government for more than
$10,000 in monetary damages must be settled by the U.S. Claims
Court based in the nation's capital.
   But the appeals court upheld Garrity's decision regarding future
reimbursement.
   The Reagan administration asked the Supreme Court to step in to
decide which court has jurisdiction in such disputes.
   The justices today ruled that Garrity, rather than the claims
court, had authority to decide the case.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said federal
judges rather than the claims court are empowered to review final
orders by the secretary of Health and Human Services refusing to
reimburse states for Medicaid expenditures.
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The case is Bowen vs. Massachusetts, 87-712.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, ``enjoying the process,''
took his search for a running mate to the Capitol today while aides
ran extensive background checks on even the driving records of
potential candidates.
   The Massachusetts governor and certain Democratic presidential
nominee entered the Capitol without saying a word today and headed
to a room to conduct meetings all day with as many as 30 or more
Democratic senators _ among them, perhaps, his eventual choice for
a vice presidential nominee.
   Dukakis met first with most of the 16 senators up for
re-election this fall, including Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York.
   Two other senators who met with Dukakis, George Mitchell of
Maine and John Kerry of Massachusetts, said the subject of the vice
presidency came up but that the likely nominee did not discuss the
names of potential candidates.
   ``He said the process is still open, and he's enjoying the
process of getting to know people,'' Kerry said. ``No names were
mentioned.''
   Paul Brountas, Dukakis' senior adviser who is leading the search
for a vice presidential candidate, sat in on the meetings, Kerry
said.
   Press secretary Dayton Duncan said Dukakis might also meet with
some House members before the day was out but planned a return
visit on July 13 to meet with House Democrats.
   He said Dukakis felt no pressure to make or announce a decision
on a running mate soon, despite suggestions the campaign would like
to make the choice before the Democratic National Convention opens
July 18.
   ``He doesn't feel like he's under any timetable or deadline,''
Duncan said.
   Dukakis planned a late-afternoon departure on a campaign swing
through the Midwest, starting in Des Moines, Iowa, where he
scheduled an event to highlight the hardship farmers face on the
drought-stricken plains.
   Dukakis dismissed speculation about his search for a running
mate, saying at an appearance Tuesday in Boston: ``There's only one
guy who knows what's going on and that's the guy you're looking at.
   ``I'm enjoying the process and I hope you are too,'' he added.
   Dukakis refused to rule out Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia for the No.
2 spot on the ticket despite Nunn's insistence that he is not
interested. The Georgia senator said he had no plans to provide the
background information being requested of prospective running mates.
   Dukakis also said Sen. Bob Graham of Florida remained in
contention.
   Campaign spokesmen were providing few details of his Washington
meetings.
   ``All that does is lead to tea-leaf reading,'' said Duncan.
   Duncan said only that the campaign would release a list of
senators he had met with by the end of the day. Dukakis was to use
an office in the Capitol where senators would drop by to see him,
Duncan said.
   Dukakis' campaign, according to sources, has asked for an
exhaustive amount of information from several potential Democratic
vice presidential contenders.
   Officials said Dukakis' campaign has requested detailed
background information, including income tax returns, academic
records, driving records, military records and health records among
other material.
   Brountas is even delving into details of Sen. John Glenn's 1984
presidential campaign. Sources said they sought information about
the Ohio senator's lingering $2.4 million campaign debt and a staff
upheavalat a critical time in that ill-fated campaign.
   The campaign wants to avoid any embarrassing surprises once the
choice has been made. Past campaigns have been damaged by
controversy over the running mate, such as in 1984 when financial
questions were raised about the husband of nominee Geraldine
Ferraro, and in 1972 when revelations about Sen. Thomas Eagleton's
psychiatric treatment led to his withdrawal from the ticket.
   Dukakis' aides have solicited information from several
prospective candidates, including Jesse Jackson and Glenn, as well
as Sens. Graham, Nunn and Bentsen and Reps. Thomas Foley of
Washington, former rival Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Lee
Hamilton of Indiana. The names of Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee also have cropped up.
   Foley has reportedly declined to provide the requested
information. Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey also has taken himself
out of the running, and Dukakis said Friday, ``I respect that.''
   Dukakis appeared in Boston with Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., at
an event where he promised to spend $3 billion on subsidized
housing.
   Cranston said the ``betting on Capitol Hill seems to be John
Glenn and Lloyd Bentsen as the front-runners'' for the No. 2 spot.
   Dukakis laughed when told of Cranston's assessment. ``I'm not a
betting man,'' he said.

<HEAD>States Barred From Sweeping Regulation of Some Groups Soliciting
for Charity</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last 7 grafs, The court, with background.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today barred states from
placing sweeping, strict regulations on professional, for-profit
organizations that solicit contributions for charities.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, ruled that a North Carolina law
that imposed such regulations violated free-speech rights.
   Numerous charitable groups such as the National Federation of
the Blind, the American Red Cross and the Easter Seal Society had
urged the court to disallow North Carolina's regulations for
fundraising. They said the restrictions severely threatened
charities' ability to raise money.
   The North Carolina regulations would have forced fundraising
organizations' solicitors to tell prospective contributors what
percentage of the money they raised over the past 12 months had
been used for expenses and fundraising fees.
   The for-profit solicitors also would have been required to
disclose, before requesting a contribution, the approximate
percentage of money that would go for charity.
   The 1985 North Carolina law also required for-profit fundraising
organizations to be licensed, and generally regarded fundraising
costs greater than 35 percent of contributions to be unreasonable
and illegal.
   The law was aimed at preventing fraud, and applied to telephone
and door-to-door solicitations.
   North Carolina officials had discovered that some for-profit
fundraisers kept between 75 percent and 85 percent of the money
raised for various charities. In no case did the officials find a
professional fundraising organization pay more than half of its
revenues to the charities in whose names the money was raised.
   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court today, said
each of North Carolina's requirements violates free-speech rights.
   ``The interest in protecting charities and the public from fraud
is, of course, a sufficiently substantial interest to justify a
narrowly tailored regulation,'' Brennan said.
   ``The question, then, is whether the (North Carolina law is
sufficiently tailored) to this remaining interest. We conclude that
it is not,'' he said.
   The decision likely will carry an immediate impact for dozens of
local and state regulations seeking to ensure that the bulk of
charitable contributions actually go to charities.
   Only a few other states _ Maine, Tennessee and Indiana among
them _ have enacted laws requiring financial disclosures during
solicitation. And the laws in those states ran into adverse court
rulings, too.
   Today's decision calls those laws into question.
   Brennan was joined today by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justices
Antonin Scalia and John Paul Stevens joined most of Brennan's
opinion.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor dissented.
   The court in 1980 and again in 1984 barred states from limiting
the amount of money charities that do their own fund-raising spend
on such campaigns.
   In 1980, the justices struck down a Schamburg, Ill., ordinance
that prohibited door-to-door solicitation of contributions by
charitable organizations that could not prove they used at least 75
percent of their revenues for charitable purposes.
   In 1984, the justices voted 5-4 to overturn a Maryland law that
barred charities and charitable fundraisers from soliciting
contributions if more than 25 percent of the revenue was consumed
by fund-raising costs.
   The Maryland law allowed charities to spend more than 25 percent
of revenues on fund-raising costs if they could show they were
unable to raise money under the legal limitation.
   The justices said in the Maryland case that high solicitation
costs were not an accurate measure of fraud.
   Today, the court said North Carolina's law does not differ
significantly from the Maryland law with which it found fault.
   The case is Riley vs. National Federation of the Blind of North
Carolina, 87-328.

   The White House issued the following statement
Wednesday after the Supreme Court upheld the Independent Counsel
Act. The statement was issued by presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater as President Reagan flew to Miami for a Republican
fund-raising event:
   The United States Supreme Court today upheld the
constitutionality of the Independent Counsel Act. In so doing the
court reversed a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for
the D.C. Circuit. Justice Kennedy did not participate in the
decision of the case.
   The president signed an extension of the Independent Counsel Act
in December 1987. At that time he expected full support for the
goal of ensuring public confidence in the impartiality and
integrity of criminal law investigation of high-level executive
branch officials. At the same time, the president expressed concern
that the act's procedures were inconsistent with the text of the
Constitution and the principle of separation of powers.
   Despite these doubts about the constitutionality of the
Independent Counsel Act, the administration has faithfully and
consistently complied with all of the act's requirements, even
offering the ongoing independent counsels parallel appointments
within the Department of Justice to protect them against
constitutional challenge. Thus, today's decision by the Court will
have no practical effect on the administration's implementation of
the Independent Counsel Act or on the ongoing investigation.
   We cannot comment on the consequences of this decision for any
existing cases.

<HEAD>Youth Convicted in Parents' Murders Despite Fantasy Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury today convicted a 20-year-old
schizophrenic of the murders of his parents, rejecting a defense
claim that he believed he was under the spell of a character in the
fantasy game ``Dungeons and Dragons'' at the time.
   The jury found Daniel Kasten guilty of shooting his parents as
they lay sleeping in their Lake Ronkonkoma home in May 1987.
   In closing arguments yesterday, Kasten's lawyer, William Nash,
said that the case was not about ``Dungeons and Dragons.''
   ``This case is about psychoses, delusions and schizophrenia,''
Nash said. ``Dungeons and Dragons is the game Mr. Kasten decided to
make his own reality.''
   The lawyer said Kasten believed he was under the control of the
``Mind Flyer'' character when he shot his parents, Edith and Joseph
Kasten.
   But Assistant District Attorney Randall Hinrichs, said: ``No one
is saying that Kasten is a normal, well-adjusted individual. A
normal, well-adjusted individual wouldn't kill his parents.''
   But he added, ``At the time that he killed both his parents, he
was aware that he had a gun in his hand and it could cause harm.''
   Hinrichs also played part of Kasten's videotaped confession in
which he said that he had thought about murdering his parents for
years but had hesitated because he knew it was wrong.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation:
   
   June 28
   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on drug hysteria:
   Worried Americans tell pollsters that drugs are the nation's No.
1 problem. Congress is about to boost spending in the ``war on
drugs'' to $9.1 billion a year. George Bush, Michael Dukakis and
Jesse Jackson battle over drug issues. Politicians point fingers at
each other for not voting to impose the death penalty on drug
dealers who commit murder.
   At the risk of being branded soft on drugs and ridden out of
town on a rail, may we suggest that the ``drug crisis'' is being
blown out of proportion and that while it is serious, the country
has more important concerns?
   Rep. Fortney Stark, D-Calif., deserves credit for trying to put
the drug threat in perspective by circulating three revealing
numbers among his colleagues: Last year illegal narcotics use
killed fewer than 6,000 Americans, while cigarettes caused more
than 300,000 deaths and alcohol 60,000.
   Of course, the damage done by drugs greatly exceeds 6,000
deaths. Illicit narcotics are a cause of crime, grief, wasted lives
and AIDS transmission. The problem is grave, but not overwhelming.
Drugs should be addressed with more balance, less political
posturing and no hysteria.

   The Tulsa (Okla.) Tribune on the U.S. space station:
   Politicians seldom take steps that lack immediate results _ and
subsequent benefit at the ballot box.
   Thus it was cheering to see the Senate appropriations defense
subcommittee vote $800 million last week toward the planned U.S.
space station, even if NASA says that is $100 million less than
necessary to make it operational by a 1996 target. The figure is
far better than the $200 million approved by another subcommittee
last week, an amount space officials said was so insufficient it
would derail the project.
   A space station manned by scientists is the key to solving
universal questions _ and ones of survival on Earth. It is not a
frill or a luxury.
   Even those in Congress with focus no further than the next
election apparently realize that.

   Salem (Ore.) Statesman-Journal on the Pentagon scandal:
   Who was minding the store?
   The widening investigation of fraud and bribery in the nation's
weapons procurement system is sickening, but it is not surprising.
That's what happens when a climate of permissiveness, starting at
the very top, pervades a bureaucratic system. ...
   The lackadaisical disregard for the ethical conduct displayed by
scores of important appointees in the Reagan administration has set
the tone for those in lesser positions. It's no wonder that the
procurement system became riddled with bribery and fraud.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch, on the Pentagon scandal:
   The ongoing federal investigation of Pentagon corruption focuses
on the selling of sensitive inside information. But the problem of
corrupt Pentagon procurement goes beyond bribery.
   In many ways, the entire system has become corrupt. ... As it
has taken years for the mess in Pentagon procurement to develop, so
it will take years to repair the damage.
   To begin that process, whoever wins the election in November
must make a top-to-bottom reform of Pentagon planning and military
procurement an urgent priority.

   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin on the possible Marcos return to the
Philippines:
   Philippine President Aquino would be risking a lot by letting
Ferdinand Marcos return home, even to stand trial as a defendant in
the theft of national wealth.
   Marcos, who has been living in Honolulu since February 1986, has
previously asked for permission to go home. He wanted to be with
his dying mother and also to attend her funeral. These requests
were wisely rejected by the Aquino government, which has enough
troubles without letting the deposed president back into the
country.
   Aquino's fragile government is asking for trouble by letting the
mischievous Marcos back in the country, even if he is under lock
and key. Opportunities are still ripe for Marcos and his old
backers to exploit his presence in Manila to stir up insurrection.
   As badly as the Philippines wants Marcos' millions, the price of
having Marcos back home again may be too costly a trade-off.

   The Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune on the Greenhouse Effect:
   Look closely at the news photos coming out of drought-stricken
farm regions, at images of sun-baked land and withered crops. If a
group of scientists who testified before a congressional hearing
last week are right, pictures like that could be common in years to
come _ and we have only ourselves to blame.
   The cars that clog our freeways, the factories and power plants
that spew pollutants into the air, the massive deforestation taking
place in poor countries _ they all contribute to the ``greenhouse
effect,'' a warming trend expected to profoundly impact our planet.
The four warmest years of the last 100 have been in the 1980s, and
1988 is shaping up to be the hottest on record.
   What could be the long-range consequences? As with just about
anything, there will be winners and losers. America's rich Farm
Belt could dry up, but Canadian and Soviet agriculture would
benefit.
   Because some countries stand to benefit from a global warming
trend, it could be difficult to enlist their support for measures
to fight it. ...
   So what can be done? A start would be to clean house in our
country by phasing out polluting plants, improving
mass-transportation systems and developing pollution-free
alternative energy sources.
   America, after all, is one of the major contributors to the
problem. If this country doesn't show leadership, who will?

   The Knoxville (Tenn.) News-Sentinel, on line-item vetoes:
   If the president had a line-item veto, would it be easier for
him to fight spending excesses on Capitol Hill? Though common sense
says yes, opponents of the idea cite discouraging evidence from
states that already have this budget device. They say that on the
average these states have no more success in restraining outlays
than other states.
   But George Mason University economist Mark Crain, currently on
leave to the White House budget office, has conducted a more
detailed analysis. He reports that not all line-item vetoes are
created equal: The most effective type seems to be the
``item-reduction veto,'' which allows a governor to substitute a
lower dollar figure than the one sought by the legislature for a
particular item. Only 10 states have this budget device.
   Crain finds that when all other variables are held constant, the
item-reduction veto slashes average annual spending increases by
more than half _ from 4 percent to 1.3 percent.
   Over the years that adds up to enormous savings ... Crain's
findings make the case for a strong line-item veto more convincing
than ever.

   The Orange County (Calif.) Register on tougher drug laws:
   The law authorizing the seizure of vehicles involved in drug
transactions was intended to punish smugglers and big-time dealers
by taking trucks or dope-laden tugboats at the same time the drugs
themselves were confiscated. ... Now the authorities claim the
right to confiscate a vehicle with a few marijuana seeds on or in
it, and sell it at auction unless the owner takes the initiative of
contesting the seizure. The owner doesn't need to be convicted of
selling, buying or possessing an illicit drug to lose the vehicle.
   Such a penalty for a minor crime for which punishment is already
prescribed by law is intended to frighten small-timers, not bother
big dealers.
   The drug law Catch-22 is on display here. The more drug laws
drive up the price of illicit drugs, the more tempting the trade
will be, and the more violent and utterly unscrupulous people will
dominate it...
   Drug laws do not keep drugs away from those who want them, and
they have unfortunate side-effects, like massive increases in real
crimes such as mugging and robbery. The latest escalation simply
illustrates the point. It should be abandoned, and we should move
to something constructive, like a spirited debate about drug
legalization.

   Fond du Lac (Wis.) Reporter on federal drought aid:
   We agree wholeheartedly with Gov. Thompson that Wisconsin's
drought-stricken farmers deserve better treatment from the federal
government.
   Thompson, in Chicago ... with other governors to discuss the
Midwest drought, got in a brief word with U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng but received less than total attention.
   The governor told Lyng that dairy states deserve better
representation on the administration's drought study commission.
Lyng responded that he had to see the president and left the
session after only a short appearance. In Washington,
administration spokesmen said Lyng expects it to rain within two
weeks and make emergency help unnecessary.
   Thompson was insulted by the treatment. Wisconsin farmers should
be, too. A good deal of damage is already done but Lyng is playing
weatherman and predicting rain. He says that will make aid unneeded.

   Evening Express, Portland, Maine, on baseball manager Billy
Martin's firing:
   Let's start with an undeniable premise: Billy Martin is a loose
cannon and George Steinbrenner is the weirdest owner of a
professional baseball team since Charlie Finley. That probably
explains why Martin is the ex-manager of the New York Yankees for
the fifth time.
   What remains inexplicable is why Steinbrenner keeps hiring
Martin back only to fire him again and again. Or why Martin, who
knows he's going to be sacked the next time Steinbrenner gets up on
the wrong side of the bed, keeps taking the job. ...
   Not that anyone in these parts really cares. Actually, from the
standpoint of Red Sox fans, Steinbrenner's ability to keep the
much-loathed Yankees in turmoil _ and thus from winning pennants _
can be classified as a Good Thing. If Boston doesn't win a pennant,
there is at least some small solace in the knowledge that the
Yankees won't either.
   Keep up the good work, George.

   The Lewiston (Maine) Daily Sun on the Hollywood writers' strike:
   The writers' strike may be the best thing that has happened to
the American family since dogs were invented. Brothers, sisters,
mothers and fathers may be forced to use their time for better
purposes. Who knows, maybe your neighbors will stumble on a
previously unknown offspring who got lost in the couch crowd that
was formerly routinely planted before the tube.
   Yes, TV turmoil may eventually translate into family unity and
an aid to education. Public and-or informative television,
mind-expanding entertainment alternatives and even quality,
relations-enhancing discussions are all part of the 1988 prime-time
home agenda.
   If the strike continues into the fall season, the denizens of
Hollywood may have to lower themselves from cruising around in
Rolls Royces and Porsches to driving American cars, and family
counseling services around the country may fall on hard times as
well.

   The Seattle Times on the Contras:
   Pink slips are flying at Contra headquarters as the Nicaraguan
rebels go through a political version of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Without a steady supply of dollars from Washington, the Contras
cannot sustain their challenge of the Sandinista government in
Managua. Largely a creation of the Reagan administration, the
Contras never stirred a loyal following outside the United States.
   Finally, Congress lost interest. Last March a compromise aid
package of $47.9 million was approved to cushion the implosion of
the rebel movement.
   As the military forces bicker, the political resistance effort
is going through its own period of deflation and dissent. In better
times, the Miami-based Contras had a worldwide budget of $5 million
and offices or representatives in Honduras, Costa Rica, Spain,
Italy, France, Britain and West Germany.
   To save money, the plenary session of the Contra network will be
held in the Dominican Republic, not Miami.
   The Contra dissidents, timid on the battlefield and jealous of
their perquisites, may inspire a hostile takeover only in a resort
convention hall.

<HEAD>Veterans Convoy Attempts Nicaragua Trip Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Peace Convoy is heading back to
the U.S.-Mexico border, where it will try again to leave the
country with 30 tons of humanitarian aid for Nicaragua packed into
17 aging trucks and buses.
   The convoy plans to cross into Mexico in the rickety vehicles,
loaded down with food, clothing and medical supplies, at Laredo on
July 9, spokesman Joseph Franklin said Wednesday.
   The U.S. Customs Service barred the convoy from crossing the
border at Laredo earlier this month, and seized four vehicles after
the group refused to post bond and sign a series of papers
promising the trucks would be returned to the United States.
   About 100 participatns in the convoy and 30 of their vehicles
arrived in Washington last week to rally against Customs' decision,
circling around the White House and in front of the State
Department in three days of protests.
   The convoy, made up largely of Vietnam and other veterans, was
unsuccessful in convincing the Reagan administration to reverse its
decision. The group was also unable to meet with Elliot Abrams,
assistant secretary of state for Inter-American affairs, or anyone
else in the administration, Franklin said.
   ``It's been a complete stonewall,'' said Franklin.
   Officials contend that letting the vehicles remain in Nicaragua
would violate a trade embargo. They have said they cannot meet with
the group because the matter is in litigation. The convoy has filed
a federal lawsuit challenging the Customs decision.
   ``We're not going to sign any papers or post any bond'' when the
convoy gets back to Laredo, Franklin said.
   Franklin said about 35 to 40 people began the trip back to Texas
on Tuesday, with other members of the convoy returning home and a
few staying in Washington where ``we're going to keep the pressure
on.''
   He said the Reagan administration has been ``despicable in their
deceit, in their contempt for the people of Nicaragua, especially
Elliot Abrams. But he's just following the party line.''
   The convoy began in four cities _ Seattle, Missoula, Mont.,
Minneapolis and Caribou, Maine, and the four groups traveled
through 100 cities in 42 states collecting aid before joining up in
Austin and arriving in Laredo June 7.
   In addition to the 30 tons on the trucks, another 140 tons of
aid has been shipped to Nicaragua. Convoy members say the trucks
are needed by the people of Nicaragua to deliver humanitarian aid
around the country by non-governmental groups. One of the buses was
designated for transportation of hospital patients.

   Vice President George Bush said today that
sweeping changes being proposed by Soviet Leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev should be viewed with optimism, but cautioned, ``The cold
war is not over.''
   In a speech to the World Affairs Council, the all-but-certain
Republican nominee credited America's military buildup with being
responsible for the change in Soviet thinking. ``My point is that
it was eight years of American strength that confronted the Soviet
Union with the true costs of aggression and the necessity of
reform,'' Bush said.
   He said that President Reagan's summit in Moscow with Gorbachev
late last month was the result of ``eight years of moral
determination and hard work rebuilding American might. But this
said, we must remember the cold war is not over.
   ``We must be bold enough to seize the opportunity of change, but
at the same time prepared for, as one pundit titled his column,
`the protracted conflict.'''
   Bush spoke in San Francisco at the wrap-up of a 24-hour visit to
northern California chiefly intended to raise money for GOP coffers
at two private fund-raisers. On his return to Washington today,
Bush planned to stop in Appleton, Wis., to highlight the plight of
farmers hurt by the drought.
   In discussing America's military buildup, Bush took note of the
investigation of alleged bribery, fraud and corruption at the
Pentagon.
   ``If the news stories are true,'' he said, ``the accused have
done more than steal from the public treasury. They have undermined
America's security and broken faith with the American people.''
   In the prepared text of his speech released earlier, Bush
promised ``we will throw the book'' at guilty parties. However, in
delivering the address, he omitted that phrase.
   The vice president cautioned, however, about over-reacting to
the alleged corruption.
   ``The first reaction in Congress to the scandals _ to increase
the regulatory bureaucracy at Defense _ though understandable, will
only add to the complexity and worsen the problem,'' Bush said.
``The answer is to reduce, cut and simplify, including staff and
executive overhead.''
   The vice president said that Congress and the executive branch
should make a compact ``to take the patronage and pork out of
defense.''
   In a series of interviews Tuesday, Bush said he was not worried
about a Gallup Poll for the Times Mirror Corp. that showed him
running 13 points behind Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis. The survey was released Monday.
   ``I don't make too much of it,'' Bush said, adding that polls
had shown him trailing then-rival Bob Dole before the New Hampshire
primary, which he won handily. ``I look at it as something that can
be taken care of.
   ``I like to come back. I think I'm going to win,'' he said.
   Bush offered a preview of his foreign policy address in
responding to reports about Gorbachev's opening remarks Tuesday to
a Communist Party conference that is expected to produce a showdown
this week between reform and conservative forces in the Soviet
Union.
   The Soviet leader urged a redistribution of power in the Soviet
Union to give new authority to the president and legislature. He
said his country must break with the ``ossified system'' of the
past.
   Asked his view of Gorbachev's speech, Bush said he had not been
briefed on the Soviet leader's remarks, but that ``it seems to me
that (the address) is quite encouraging.
   ``I am one who views perestroika as manifestation of change _
some of that change is real. I'm also one that feels that as they
go about reforming their country, we should look for opportunities
to do more with the Soviet Union in terms of investment or
exchanges of people or whatever it is.''
   However, Bush said, ``we ought to be very, very wary and not
jump to the conclusion that a call of that nature be confused with
fundamental, permanent change in the Soviet Union's approach to
other countries and indeed whether it's a fundamental departure
from their Marxist system.''
   As to whether the Soviets are moving toward democracy, he said:
``I don't see the evidence of it yet.''
   He urged the Soviets to strive for fuller compliance with the
Helsinki accords which prescribe how nations should respect human
rights.
   Specifically, Bush called for more Jews and divided families to
be allowed to leave the Soviet Union.``I think that would be the
most visible manifestation of real glasnost, openness, and real
reform, perestroika. And that's what we ought to be looking for and
encouraging in every way possible,'' the vice president said.
   On another subject, Bush said carriers of the deadly AIDS virus
should be protected by the federal government from discrimination
on the job, in schools and elsewhere.
   ``I think it is needed,'' Bush said, embracing the key _ and
most controversial _ recommendation of President Reagan's AIDS
commission.
   ``I think it is important to do a lot to lay to rest some of the
fears. There is a lot of misunderstanding,'' Bush said.
   Reagan has not taken a position on the recommendation.

   Daily Journal, Fergus Falls, Minn., on the Department of Defense
scandal:
   Is there nothing that's not for sale in Washington, D.C.?
Americans have every reason to be disillusioned with the government
in general and the military in particular when those entrusted with
the nation's defense are more concerned about profit than their
country.
   The Pentagon was shaken to its foundation recently by the news
of a two-year investigation into alleged ``insider trading'' within
the Department of Defense. The news broke when the FBI and the
Naval Investigative Service conducted raids on 38 locations in
search for evidence of theft of classified information from the
Pentagon.
   The stories of waste and mismanagement within the Defense
Department are old hat; nobody is surprised any longer by tales of
$7,000 coffee pots. But even the most hardened cynics have to be
shocked at the allegations of the blatant, self-serving activities
of current and former Defense Department employees. Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., a strong supporter of the Pentagon, has predicted
that the nation will be ``shocked'' by the depth of the wrongdoing.
   Shocked, indeed. The American people are told that the country
cannot afford programs to aid the young, the old and the poor
because the nation must maintain a strong defense. While many
Americans are prepared to sacrifice to ensure a strong defense, it
appears the defenders are robbing them blind.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on fishing vessel safety standards:
   Congress appears to be on the verge of at last enacting law to
require basic survival gear on commercial fishing vessels. Both
houses should be strongly urged to push ahead and rectify one of
the nation's worst safety shortcomings.
   There are some 33,000 commercial fishing boats in the United
States. But for about 90 percent of them _ vessels under 200 tons _
the government requires only that there be a life jacket for each
person aboard. Nothing in the rules about thermal body suits ...
nothing about life rafts or even a radio beacon to call for
emergency aid.
   Though industry leaders, and even many of the fishermen, oppose
federal regulation as being too costly and probably ineffectual,
there is need for establishment of minimum standards. That would
save lives.

   The Evening Journal, Martinsburg, W.Va., on federal anti-drug
legislation:
   Republicans in Congress have introduced extremely tough
anti-drug legislation. Vice President George Bush enthusiastically
has endorsed the measure, which, among other provisions, calls for
the death penalty to be meted out to drug kingpins.
   The likely Democratic presidential nominee, Gov. Michael Dukakis
of Massachusetts, has piously proclaimed that one of the reasons he
is seeking to take up residence in the White House is because of
the Republican shortcomings in the war against drugs. However,
Dukakis thus far has refused to back the death penalty for drug
dealers.
   Bush cites the brutal slaying of Drug Enforcement Administration
agent Enrique Camarena Salazar in his argument for establishing the
death penalty. The vice president makes a good point.
   The legislation introduced by congressional Republicans in
addition to establishing the death penalty for drug dealers calls
for increased funding for the Coast Guard to patrol for drug
traffickers. It also would impose stiff sanctions against convicted
drug users, including heavy fines and making them ineligible for
student loans and federally backed mortgages.
   If Dukakis and Co. actually are serious about waging a real war
on drugs, their support for establishing the death penalty for
dealers immediately would be forthcoming.

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on sex bias bans:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In supporting a New York City ordinance banning sex bias by
large clubs, the U.S. Supreme Court has made clearer the right of
women to an equal chance to get ahead in the male-dominated
business and professional world.
   Previous decisions in this area won women admission to such
business-oriented organizations as the Jaycee and Rotary
organizations. The latest extended that right to large, so-called
``private'' clubs where business contacts and deals are often made.
   At issue was a city law that barred discrimination against women
in clubs that have more than 400 members, regularly provide meal
service, allow dues to be paid by members' employers or get some of
their income by providing services, such as conference rooms, to
non-members. In effect, the city says that such clubs are not
really private.
   The court pointed out that its ruling did not apply to all
private clubs. It said: ``It is conceivable ... that an association
might be able to show that it is organized for specific expressive
purposes and that it will not be able to advocate its desired
viewpoints nearly as effectively if it cannot confine its
membership to those who share the same sex, for example, or the
same religion.''
   In other words, an organization would have to prove it is truly
private if it wants First Amendment protection to keep out certain
classes of people.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a setback to the Reagan
administration and some of its key former officials, today upheld a
law that allows independent prosecutors to investigate alleged
crimes by high-ranking government officials.
   The 7-1 decision dispels crucial doubts about the convictions of
former Reagan aides Michael K. Deaver and Lyn C. Nofziger and
clears away a possible stumbling block in the prosecution of
ex-White House aides Oliver North, John M. Poindexter and two
others indicted in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The decision also allows an investigation to continue into the
activities of Attorney General Edwin Meese III, accused of
financial improprieties and conflicts of interest.
   The court, in a momentous constitutional decision, said the
special prosecutor law does not violate the separation of powers
between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of
government guaranteed by the Constitution.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in his opinion for the
court, said, ``We observe first that this case does not involve an
attempt by Congress to increase its own powers at the expense of
the executive branch.
   ``Similarly, we do not think that the act works any judicial
usurpation of properly executive functions.''
   Rehnquist continued, ``Finally, we do not think that the act
impermissibly undermines the powers of the executive branch or
disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate branches.''
   Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the
Iran-Contra affair, said in a statement moments after the decision
was announced:
   ``The independent counsel statute provides a workable solution
to a difficult problem. We are gratified that the Supreme Court has
upheld the constitutionality of that statute.''
   President Reagan, queried about the court's decision as he
arrived in Miami for a speech, said, ``Nothing's changed. I can't
comment.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the decision ``will
have no practical effect on the administration's implementation of
the independent counsel act or on the ongoing investigations.''
   A White House statement said that despite ``doubts about the
constitutionality of the Independent Counsel Act, the
administration has faithfully and consistently complied with all of
the act's requirements.''
   The chief justice acknowledged that the law limits presidential
power to investigate and prosecute some alleged crimes.
   But he said there are adequate safeguards to protect against
abuses.
   For example, Rehnquist said, the law permits the attorney
general to decide when a special prosecutor is warranted and allows
the attorney general to fire a special prosecutor for ``good
cause.''
   ``Notwithstanding the fact that the counsel is to some degree
`independent' and free from executive supervision to a greater
extent than other federal prosecutors, in our view ... the act
gives the executive branch sufficient control over the independent
counsel to ensure that the president is able to perform his
constitutionally assigned duties,'' Rehnquist said.
   The chief justice read parts of his 38-page opinion from the
bench, speaking for five minutes.
   Underscoring the importance of the case, Justice Antonin Scalia
read a portion of his lone dissent for nine minutes.
   Scalia said the balance of powers and the separation of powers
are what make the U.S. Constitution a unique and enduring document.
   ``In dictatorships of the modern world, bills of rights are a
dime a dozen,'' he said.
   The decision was the last to be handed down by the high court on
its last day of the 1987-88 term.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Made it easier for workers to prove their bosses are guilty of
illegal discrimination.
   In their most important civil rights decision of the year, the
justices by an 8-0 vote expanded the way employees can use
statistical evidence to prove bias.
   _ Made it easier for millions of non-union workers to withhold
financial support from the unions that represent them in collective
bargaining.
   The court, by a 5-3 vote, ruled that non-union employees of
private employers may not be forced to pay the equivalent of union
dues if some of that money is used for activities not directly
related to collective bargaining.
   _ Severely limited state efforts to shield young sex abuse
victims when they testify at criminal trials.
   The justices, voting 6-2, overturned the conviction of an Iowa
man sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually molesting two
13-year-old girls.
   _ Struck down an Oklahoma man's death sentence but stopped short
of ruling whether capital punishment may be used for convicted
killers who committed their crimes before reaching age 16.
   In what had been expected to be its most important capital
punishment decision of the year, the justices could not muster a
majority of votes to resolve a key question: Does execution of
teen-age killers violate the Constitution's ban on ``cruel and
unusual punishment'?''
   _ Ruled the federal government may give money to religious
groups to promote chastity among America's teen-agers.
   The 5-4 ruling said a 1981 federal law that funnels taxpayer
money to private groups to counsel adolescents against premarital
sex is not unconstitutional on its face.
   _ Barred states from placing sweeping, strict regulations on
professional, for-profit organizations that solicit contributions
for charities.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, ruled that a North Carolina law
that imposed such regulations violated free-speech rights.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the newest member of the court and
one of three justices appointed by Reagan, did not take part in the
independent prosecutor decision. Kennedy disqualified himself
without giving an explanation.
   The court overturned a 2-1 federal appeals court ruling last
Jan. 22 that declared the Watergate-era special prosecutor law
unconstitutional.
   Congress passed the law after the scandal that led to President
Nixon's resignation to provide an independent mechanism for
investigating alleged high-level government wrongdoing.
   Opponents and supporters of the law, a key portion of the Ethics
in Government Act, cited the Watergate case to buttress their
position.
   The law's advocates said it was essential to assure the nation
that crimes in high places would not be covered up.
   But opponents pointed out that Nixon was forced out of office
because of public opinion and the threat of impeachment, without
any need for an independent investigation.
   The law empowers a special federal court to appoint independent
counsels, or special prosecutors, at the request of the attorney
general. The attorney general first conducts a preliminary probe,
generally lasting up to 90 days, to determine whether charges
against a government official warrant appointment of the outside
counsel.
   The law was challenged by Theodore B. Olson, a former assistant
attorney general accused of lying to Congress in 1983 during a
dispute over the Environmental Protection Agency's cleanup program
for toxic waste sites.
   Alexia Morrison, a Washington lawyer, is the special prosecutor
investigating the case.
   The Reagan administration supported Olson's challenge, arguing
that the independent counsels violate constitutionally mandated
separation of powers between the three branches of government.
   Among the defenders of the law are the Senate and the Democratic
leadership in the House.
   The immediate stakes in the case involved some of the most
prominent figures of the Reagan presidency.
   Deaver, convicted of lying to a grand jury and a House
subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities, is awaiting
sentencing. Whitney North Seymour was the independent counsel who
prosecuted him.
   Nofziger, prosecuted by independent counsel James C. McKay, was
sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined $30,000 for illegal
lobbying. McKay also is conducting the investigation into the
charges involving Meese.
   North, a former aide to the National Security Council, was
expected to go on trial in the fall in the Iran-Contra case on
charges he conspired to divert profits from the sale of arms to
Iran to the Contra rebels fighting the government in Nicaragua.
   His co-defendants _ Poindexter, businessman Albert A. Hakim and
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord _ are to be tried
separately.
   Some said the Iran-Contra prosecution, the Nofziger conviction
and the Meese probe would survive any adverse Supreme Court ruling
on the independent counsel law because Walsh and McKay received
backup authority from Meese to conduct their investigations.
   But there had been uncertainty in those cases as well because
the investigations began before the backup authority was conferred.
   Ms. Morrison and Seymour did not receive such backup authority
to conduct their respective investigations of Olson and Deaver.
   The case is Morrison vs. Olson, 87-1279.

   If they throw the book at Ronald
Redmond, he might just keep it.
   Redmond, 23, is charged with stealing 723 books and 56 record
albums over two years from the library of the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro.
   ``He's probably read most of them,'' said police Detective Glenn
Knight. ``He's a smart man.''
   The books and records are valued at more than $23,000, and
include works by Mark Twain, William Shakespeare and Soren
Kierkegaard, university officials said.
   Police arrested Redmond on Tuesday after raiding his apartment
based on a telephone tip, Knight said.
   ``We originally went there looking for 100 books _ we didn't
expect seven times that,'' he said. ``We had to call a one-ton van
for backup.''
   Redmond, who was graduated from the university last year, told
police he wanted to add to his collection, Knight said.
   Redmond was charged with one felony count of false pretenses and
released on his own recognizance, Knight said.

   The FBI is investigating the abduction of a
novice nun wearing traditional habit who was forcibly put into a
car by members of her family opposed to her remaining in the
convent, authorities said.
   The nun's brother, who participated in the abduction, said his
sister is free to return to the convent after she listens to her
family's arguments against it.
   It was the second time in four months in which a family member
of Mary Sue Greve, known as Sister Mary Cecilia, 22, attempted to
keep her from returning to the convent, state police said.
   Police said Ms. Greve was walking with two other nuns on a
street near St. Joseph Novitiate Convent in Roundtop, N.Y., where
she has lived for the past two years, when she was pushed into a
waiting car Sunday.
   John Greve of Cincinnati said he and two brothers and their
father took his sister.
   ``The reason we did this was to give her the facts,'' he said.
If she wants to return to the convent after she hears her family
out, she is free to do so. But we know that will be the last time
we will probably ever see her again.''
   Greve said the family opposed his sister's joining St. Joseph
after the family broke with a traditionalist Catholic church in a
Cincinnati suburb.
   St. Joseph's, with about 40 nuns and novices, is not recognized
by the Roman Catholic Church.
   Special Agent Michael O'Brien said Tuesday the FBI was
investigating her disappearance, but declined to elaborate.
   ``We are all in a state of shock,'' said the Rev. Clarence
Kelly, a spiritual adviser at the convent. ``The last I ever heard
of something like this was the case of St. Thomas Aquinas in the
13th century. His family kidnapped him because they did not want
him to become a Dominican priest.''
   New York State Police said Ms. Greve went to Cincinnati, where
her parents live, following Sunday's incident. Her brother refused
to say where Ms. Greve and the rest of the family were.
   State police said they would not press charges unless the woman
wants to file them.
   ``It's a family-type matter,'' Trooper Ron Rieseberg said
Monday. ``I think they're (authorities) mostly interested in the
well-being of the girl.''
   About four months ago, Ms. Greve's mother abducted her after
persuading her to get into a car to listen to a tape of her
nephews, police said. Once inside the car, the mother drove off,
refusing to return her daughter to the convent.

   Molly, a Dublin duck who in recent years
has sought shelter in the shade of the Irish Parliament building,
had three of her seven day-old ducklings snatched by a magpie on
Wednesday.
   Dessie Rice, a groundskeeper for the government building known
as Leinster House, said Molly was ``not having a lot of luck this
year.''
   Molly, who waddles to Leinster House every spring from her home
in St. Stephen's Green, Dublin's central park, also had a mishap
with a speeding motorist three weeks ago.
   ``I thought at first she was dead,'' said Rice.``But I carried
her back into the grounds and she came to. However, she has been a
little bit lame ever since.''
   In previous years, Molly would lead her young within a few hours
of birth back through the traffic to Stephen's Green where there is
more cover.
   This year, perhaps because of the accident, she ``doesn't seem
inclined to go'' and is still at Leinster House with the four
surviving ducklings, Rice said.

   Officials are trying to determine if a

that was summoned to help him.
   Antonie Nolan, 24, may have been dead before he was hit by the
12-ton fire engine on Sunday, police said Tuesday.
   The cause of death may not be known for several weeks when the
Alameda County Coroner's office releases autopsy results.
   Traffic Officer Mike Oliveira said police received an emergency
call that a man was lying motionless in the street.
   A fire engine, ambulance and police car were dispatched.
Firefighters, trained in first aid, are routinely sent on medical
emergencies, said Oliveira.
   The fire engine was moving at about 20 mph, using its headlights
and searchlight on the street, which is very poorly lit and
littered with debris, he said.
   Oliveira said a firefighter spotted the man in the road, but
before the engine driver could stop, the truck ran over the man.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Labor Committee voted 11-5 today to
approve legislation that would increase the current $3.35 an hour
federal minimum wage by $1.20 over the next three years.
   The legislation, sponsored by committee Chairman Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., would raise the wage rate to $4.55 per hour over
three years, identical to a proposal being considered by House
leaders.
   Although several Republican senators earlier had said they would
offer amendments to the bill, none was introduced at the meeting.
   ``There was no reason to take on those issues in committee,''
said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah. ``There will be amendments when
the bill gets to the floor.''
   An earlier proposal, introduced in both the House and Senate,
would have increased the wage to $4.65 per hour over three years
and indexed it to 50 percent of the average national wage
thereafter.
   The House, during subcommittee and full committee action,
dropped the indexing provision and boosted the rate to $5.05 per
hour over four years.
   When the legislation goes to the House floor, there is expected
to a bipartisan substitute proposal to bring the minimum wage to
$4.55 per hour over three years.

   Estonian delegates to the Communist Party
conference said Wednesday they expect the Kremlin to back their
Baltic republic's demand for autonomy from Moscow as the ``only
chance'' to keep the Soviet Union strong.
   In interviews with The Associated Press, three Estonian
delegates described what they said were efforts dating back to last
fall to work out a political and economic program giving the
republic independence over its economy, ecology, education and
culture.
   The program has been summarized in the platform of Estonia's 32
delegates to the party conference, who said it has been well
received by influential reformers in Moscow.
   ``The Soviet leadership supports it, I know,'' said Johan Aare,
one of Estonia's most popular television journalists and leader of
a Greens ecology movement born in the small republic last month.
   Mikhail Bronstein, an economics professor at Estonia's historic
Tartu university, said the ideas in the republic's platform were
worked out unofficially by intellectuals in discussions that
started months ago.
   Estonia was the first of the three Baltic republics to form a
National Front in support of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
``perestroika,'' or restructuring. Lithuania has followed suit,
while hundreds of Latvian intellectuals have formulated demands for
sovereignty extending to independent membership for their republic
in the United Nations and their own team at the Olympics.
   The intellectuals also worked out a more detailed program for
economic independence known by the acronym of IME, which means
``miracle'' in Estonian, Bronstein said.
   At first, he said, conservatives attacked the program and
accused Estonian nationals of seeking secession from the Soviet
Union.
   ``On the contrary, we see this as the only chance of
strengthening the Soviet Union along Leninist principles of equal
rights, sovereignty and a federation,'' Bronstein said.
   Both he and Aare said they see a federation as the only path to
develop their republic and to help keep the Soviet Union
competitive.
   ``The tempo of growth is what is important,'' Aare said. ``If
there was just one state in the world, it wouldn't matter. But if
there are other states moving faster right by your side, you cannot
lag behind.''
   Estonians often compare their standard of living with that of
neighboring Finland, which has a prosperous, Western-style economy.
   Both men conceded it might be difficult to create a federation
in the Soviet Union when the 15 republics that make up the country
have such diverse histories and levels of development.
   Central Asian republics moved from near-feudal circumstances to
socialism after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Bronstein said. By
contrast, Estonia and the Baltic republics of Lithuania and Latvia
developed under centuries of domination by the prosperous Hanseatic
League, he said.
   But they appeared convinced their ideas will win Kremlin
approval.
   ``It is necessary to work carefully, thoroughly,
diplomatically,'' said Aare. ``But we have a program, that's the
important thing.''
   The two men gave the impression that Estonian intellectuals have
made a careful, well-planned effort to use Gorbachev's reforms to
bring about change in their republic.
   They also stressed that demands to make Estonian the official
language and to improve education in Estonian culture are not
directed against the tens of thousands of ethnic Russians brought
into the republic since World War II to man industry.
   Just over half of Estonia's 1.56 million citizens are Estonians,
compared with 90 percent in 1940, when Soviet troops seized the
three Baltic republics under a secret protocol to Moscow's 1939
pact with Nazi Germany.
   Russian immigration, maintenance of indigenous culture and the
spoiling of the environment by post-World War II industry are of
growing concern to citizens of the Baltic republics.
   Aare said Estonian intellectuals criticized the then-leader of
Estonia's Communists, Karl G. Vaino, and decided to unite in a
National Front, which he said has since gained the support of tens
of thousands of the republic's 1.5 million people.
   Bronstein said the Estonians want the right to open their own
offices in Scandinavian countries and the United States to further
trade and maintain contacts with emigres.
   Emigres from the Baltic republics have been reviled in official
media as enemies of socialism who want to restore the ``bourgeois
democracy'' that ruled before Soviet troops seized the three
territories in 1940.
   Indrek Toome, the Communist Party secretary in charge of
ideology in Estonia, said it would be important to give the
National Front, the Greens and any other mass social movements
which emerge a constitutional right to exist.

<HEAD>Court Rules for Michigan Farm Family Accused of Enslaving Retarded
Men</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, ruling for a Michigan farm
family accused of enslaving two retarded men for more than 10
years, said today that illegal involuntary servitude cannot be
imposed through psychological coercion alone.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices rejected Reagan administration
arguments that the legal definition of involuntary servitude should
be broad enough to include psychological coercion.
   If the court had agreed with federal prosecutors, the broader
definition of involuntary servitude _ outlawed by the
Constitution's 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery and by
federal law _ could have jeopardized certain cult groups or
religious orders that use psychological persuasion to enlist and
retain members.
   ``Absent change by Congress, the term involuntary servitude
necessarily means a condition of servitude in which the victim is
forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical
restraint or physical injury, or by the use of threat or coercion
through law or the legal process,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
wrote for the court.
   Ike and Margarethe Kozminski, who own a dairy farm in Chelsea,
Mich., were convicted of keeping Robert Fulmer and Louis Molitoris
in involuntary servitude.
   Both men are mentally retarded. Fulmer has an IQ of 67 and spent
most of his life in foster homes, in training school or working on
farms. Molitoris, who has an IQ of 60, was unemployed and living on
the streets of Ann Arbor when he met the Kozminskis.
   At trial, federal prosecutors introduced evidence that the two
men received no pay for their work, were physically abused, were
given woefully inadequate housing and were told they could not
leave the farm.
   The Kozminskis introduced evidence tending to controvert some of
that evidence.
   After a federal jury convicted them, the Kozminskis received
suspended prison sentences and were placed on probation for two
years. Ike Kozminski also was fined $20,000 and ordered to pay
Fulmer and Molitoris over $6,000 each in restitution.
   The couple's son, John, was convicted of a conspiracy charge. He
was given a suspended prison sentence, placed on two years
probation and fined $10,000.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the convictions
last year, ruling that the presiding trial judge erred in telling
jurors about involuntary servitude.
   The judge said it ``may include situations in which ... coercive
acts or words cause persons in employment to believe they cannot
freely leave employment if the acts are done or the words are
spoken with the intent to cause this result.''
   The 6th Circuit court said the judge's instructions could be
interpreted to mean that ``purely psychological coercion'' could
amount to involuntary servitude _ too broad a legal definition.
   The appeals court said involuntary servitude must feature
physical or legal coercion, or fraud and deceit used against a
victim who is a minor, an immigrant or a mental incompetent.
   The appeals court sent the Kozminskis' case back for a new trial
so a jury could decide whether the retarded men were victimized by
fraud and deceit in an effort to retain their services.
   Reagan administration lawyers, while not challenging the need
for a new trial, argued that the 6th Circuit court's ruling defined
involuntary servitude too narrowly.
   Today, the Supreme Court sent the Kozminskis' case back for a
new trial, stating the judge's instructions ``may have caused the
Kozminskis to be convicted for conduct that does not violate
(federal law).''
   But O'Connor's opinion said the record in the farm family's case
``contains sufficient evidence of physical or legal coercion to
enable a jury to convict the Kozminskis even under the stricter
standard of involuntary servitude that we announce today.''
   The case is U.S. vs. Kozminski, 86-2000.

   With 12 days remaining of the First New York
International Festival of the Arts, the festival's chairman gave it
a glowing interim review on Wednesday.
   ``I would say it (attendance) is in excess of 75 percent of the
total number of seats,'' Martin E. Segal, the festival chairman,
told a news conference.
   However, Segal said he disliked speaking in terms of attendance
percentages, since the sizes of halls vary.
   ``The judgment of the success of the festival we believe should
be around its artistic merit,'' he said.
   To a question whether too much is going on _ one night lists 68
events _ Segal said, ``We don't know the answer. We wound up with
140 composers of over 1,000 composers that are known in this
century. We wanted to be sure we were representing the scope of the
wonders of the art form of this century.''
   The festival began June 11 and will end July 11.
   Paul Libin, producer of ``Juno and the Paycock,'' said lines of
people hoping for cancellations are longer than lines outside ``The
Phantom of the Opera.'' The play, presented by the Gate Theater of
Dublin, is appearing for two weeks.
   Jacques d'Amboise, who heads the National Dance Institute, which
teaches dance in schools, said the institute's concert sold out for
two nights instead of one for the first time in 12 years.
   Robert Jones, a producer of the JVC Festival, which also is
regularly in New York in June and this year is part of the
International Festival, said, ``We have experienced what we feel is
an almost 12 percent increase in our overall business.''
   On Sunday afternoon, Segal said he attended the New Stockholm
Orchestra's U.S. debut. ``We learned about a new orchestra. They
should come back. We're presenting a number of artists for the
first time.''
   The festival will bring the city $400 million in spending, Segal
said, adding, ``Many theaters are closed at this time of year. The
festival has created a situation where events are going on.
   ``We believe the city is going to become increasingly a
12-month-a-year place for entertainment and the performing arts,
which is consequential for the city economically and for artists.''
   The festival will end July 11 with superstar opera tenor Placido
Domingo singing a free concert in Central Park. Gloria Estefan will
sing a solo and a duet with him and Linda Ronstadt will join him
for Mexican songs. The festival will then end with a fireworks
display.

   Mr. T wasn't satisfied with the work on
his mansion, so ``The A-Team'' star took the contractor to court,
and that brought out the fans.
   In the steady stream of people hoping to see the tough-guy actor
known for his bulk and his gold jewelry was the 10-year-old son of
Lake County Circuit Judge Stephen E. Walter. The boy managed to get
a photograph signed by Mr. T.
   Mr. T is suing Kenneth J. Tomkins, owner of Kenlor Development,
who he claims overcharged him for remodeling his mansion in Lake
Forest, north of Chicago on Lake Michigan. The trial was in its
fourth day Wednesday.
   The suit stems from the remodeling in 1986 and 1987 at Mr. T's
estate and included work on bathrooms, interior painting, and
security gates.
   Tomkins contends winter slowed his progress, and is countersuing
over the $168,000 project. Tomkins claims he is owed nearly
$18,000, including the cost of a company sign.
   The sign insulted him, Mr. T said. ``I was really hot, so I
grabbed the sign and tore it down.''

   Singer Wayne Newton bought, without
ever seeing, an antebellum mansion in this coastal city.
   The landmark home and nine acres of land, known as Bay Side,
were bought by telephone at auction Saturday for $250,000, said a
real estate agent whose firm handled the deal for Newton.
   ``I'm told he's interested in historical things,'' said Bruce A.
Damm of R.G. Moore Building Corp., a Virginia Beach, Va.,
development firm. ``He's going to use it for a retreat.''
   The mansion was built in 1856 on a plantation owned by the
Hollowell family of Elizabeth City, said Abby Hollowell Manning,
who grew up in the house and now lives next door. Ms. Manning's
father, Frank W. Hollowell Jr., decided to sell Bay Side after her
mother died last year.
   City council member Wendell Spivey said Newton already was the
talk of local coffee shops. ``Maybe we'll put up a billboard,'' he
said.

   Construction should start in the fall
on a library for the private papers of President Reagan.
   The proposed 153,000-square-foot library is to be built on 100
acres of land donated by a Los Angeles development company about 70
miles southeast of Reagan's ranch in Santa Barbara County.
   Some officials had proposed ground breaking as early as July 4,
but that proved to be too optimistic, C. Ronald Kimberling,
executive director of the Library Foundation, said this week.
   The application for a permit for the library is being reviewed
by Ventura County officials and is expected to go to the Ventura
County Planning Commission in September, with construction soon to
follow, he said.
   With a Spanish-style design, the library would include
underground storage, a museum and research materials depicting the
administration and historical events during the Reagan
aAdministration.
   Efforts to place the library at Stanford University in Palo Alto
fell through in April 1987 because of opposition from faculty and
city landowners.

   A Rose by any other name probably would still
have gotten the parking ticket.
   But for Pete Rose, manager of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team,
it was an especially tough day. He was already under fire for the
club's poor play and a costly lineup card mistake, when he got
tagged on the street named for him.
   ``I stopped today to get a salad on Pete Rose Way, and I got a
ticket,'' Rose said Tuesday. ``How bad can it get?''
   Rose said the traffic officer recognized him, but didn't back
off writing a $29 ticket, even when Rose offered him four tickets
to a Reds game.
   ``He said, `Are you trying to bribe me?' I said, yep,'' Rose
said. ``He said it's not going to work. I said, `I'll give you the
four tickets for being a nice guy.'
   ``He said, `OK, thanks, here's the (parking) ticket.''
   Rose took out the wrong lineup card Monday night, costing the
Reds a batter and an out in the first inning, ending a rally. The

   South African musician Johnny
Clegg, recently returned from a successful tour of Europe, is
headed to the United States next week where he will appear with
rock star Steve Winwood.
   Clegg and Savuka, a band made up of two other whites and three
blacks, will hold three shows of their own plus 22 backing up
Winwood, Clegg said.
   Savuka is known for its mixture of Western rock and black
African rhythms. Clegg, often called the ``white Zulu,'' has built
a strong following among whites and blacks in South Africa. He
speaks Zulu and spent years learning Zulu dances and music.
   The group has made several successful trips to Europe and
returned last week from a nine-country tour. Savuka's album,
``Third World Child,'' and several of the group's singles have
topped the charts in France.
   Clegg is an outspoken critic of apartheid, and one of his
biggest hits, ``Asimbonanga,'' is banned from the state-run South
African Broadcasting Corp. channels because of its sympathetic
references to jailed African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela and to activists who died in detention.

   Patrick Sherrill, who shot and killed 14
fellow postal workers two years ago, slipped through a lax
screening system for new employees, congressional investigators
said Wednesday.
   And although the Postal officials rushed help to the families of
victims immediately after the Aug. 20, 1986, Edmond, Okla.,
tragedy, the agency then dropped the ball, the General Accounting
Office reported.
   A study of 15 post offices, released by Rep. Glenn English,
D-Okla., indicated that out of 1,289 newly hired employees, 816
were hired without checking their job histories with former
employers, and police checks were not done for 748, GAO reported.
   Assistant Postmaster General John S. Trosch responded that 10
states have established policies of not providing criminal history
information for employment purposes, and many employers are
reluctant to release details about former workers out of fear they
will be sued as the source of prejudicial information or for
invasion of privacy. But the agency is working to tighten its
hiring and screening practices, he said.
   A separate GAO report on the Edmond slayings said that, while
the Postal Service provided noteworthy immediate assistance to the
families of victims, it then turned the matter over to the Oklahoma
City division, which offered further help only in response to
direct appeals from the survivors.
   The families were not contacted to see if they needed help
``because it was believed that such contacts would infringe on the
families' privacy during a time of grief. Subsequent criticism of
the handling of the tragedy can be traced to this decision,'' the
GAO said.
   The study recommended that the Postal Service initiate
contingency planning, including crisis management, in order to be
prepared to deal with the traumatic effects of any future disasters.
   In a response attached to the study, Postmaster General Anthony
Frank said he accepts the findings and recommendations and will
include the principles of crisis management in contingency plans.
   Sherrill, a letter carrier, killed 14 workers and wounded six
others before killing himself.

<HEAD>AMA Wants New Direction in War on Drugs
^Eds: UPDATES throughout with approval of Medicaid proposal,
recommendation to limit product liability awards, edit to conform.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The American Medical Association today approved a
report calling for expanded treatment of drug abusers and other
major changes in the nation's war against drugs.
   Also today, the nation's largest organization of doctors called
for reform of the nation's Medicaid health insurance system for the
poor to establish uniform nationwide eligibility standards and
uniform payments for medical care.
   The AMA's House of Delegates, its policymaking body, voted to
lobby the government to expand Medicaid to cover an additional 27
million poor people at an estimated cost of $24 billion at 1988
spending levels.
   On the drug issue, delegates called for shifting the main point
of attack from trying to catch drug traffickers to working to
reduce demand for their illegal products by expanding treatment of
abusers.
   ``We are saying this nation does have the will to overcome the
drug problem, but it simply has the wrong game plan,'' said Dr.
Lonnie Bristow, an AMA trustee from Berkeley, Calif.
   The delegates today also approved a recommendation intended to
encourage biomedical companies that may be hesitant about
developing new products for fear of lawsuits.
   It urged that state and federal governments reform the nation's
court system to limit the amount of money awarded in product
liability lawsuits.
   Worry about being sued by patients and having to pay
multimillion-dollar awards is leading the companies to hold off on
developing new vaccines, drugs and other ``potentially life-saving
technologies,'' according to a report presented to the group.
   On Tuesday, the House of Delegates rejected a ban on publishing
articles about euthanasia, but held firm against mercy killing.
   It also called for bans on toy guns that can be mistaken for the
real thing and on real, non-metallic firearms that can slip through
metal detectors and other screening devices.
   The policy-making arm of the 295,000-member group voted to urge
the federal government to end price supports for tobacco and help
tobacco farmers begin growing other crops, but postponed action on
a proposal for doubling the federal tobacco tax.
   The 420 delegates were to vote later today on a proposal calling
for creation of a new class of hospital worker.
   The drug policy approved today recommends that the federal
government expand drug abuse treatment programs, ease regulations
to permit private doctors to treat opiate addicts with methadone
and strengthen drug education programs aimed at adolescents.
   The policy also calls on the president to appoint ``a
high-ranking official of the Executive Branch to coordinate federal
drug policy'' to reduce rivalry among different agencies and keep
them from working at cross purposes.
   The policy stresses the AMA's opposition to widespread random
drug testing and to the legalization of outlawed drugs.
   The delegates reiterated their opposition to mercy killing in
the wake of an uproar over the Journal of the American Medical
Association's publication earlier this year of an article by a
doctor describing how he ended a cancer patient's life at her
request.
   The article, ``It's Over Debbie,'' touched off widespread
criticism of the journal for not publishing the author's name and
for not including a clear statement of the AMA's opposition to
mercy killing.
   However, the delegates rejected a proposal from the Nebraska
delegation to require the AMA to ``refrain from publishing articles
which involve the taking of human life without'' also printing the
association's stand against mercy killing.
   The debate over euthanasia ``will be with society for the
foreseeable future,'' said Dr. Alan Nelson, chairman of the AMA
board of trustees. ``The position of the AMA has been consistent
and it was restated today so there won't be any confusion.
Euthanasia is wrong ... and the medical profession will continue to
deplore it.''
   The delegates also are considering a proposal to organize a new
class of hospital bedside worker, called a ``registered care
technologist,'' in an effort to offset the nursing shortage.
   As envisioned in the doctors' proposal, these workers would
receive from two months to 18 months of training and would handle
such chores as bathing patients, taking vital signs and changing
bandages.
   The plan is opposed by the American Nurses' Association, which
says the answer to the shortage is increased salaries and better
working conditions.

   Firefighters today battled a blaze in Wyoming's Shosone National
Forest while a 60,000-acre timber and grass fire was brought under
control along the Montana-South Dakota border and an Indiana peat
fire smoldered for a fifth day.
   A stubborn fire that destroyed four homes and more than a dozen
farmbuildings kept firefighters busy today in rural Sonoma County,
north of San Francisco, where a wind-whipped blaze nearby destroyed
most of the historic community of Preston on Tuesday.
   A 200-acre wildfire in southern California's San Luis Obispo
County that forced the evacuation of a campground and closed a
highway was contained today, while brush fires in Riverside County
east of Los Angeles were nearly contained.
   The Montana-South Dakota and Wyoming fires were contained
Tuesday, and the border fire was delared under control early today.
   In Montana, information officer Sandi Sacher said some of the
1,034 firefighters were preparing to return home. The fire burned
over about 58,300 acres in southeastern Montana and northwestern
South Dakota, including parts of the Custer National Forest.
   ``They have delayed demobilization from what they normally do
because of the severe weather conditions and severe dryness just to
make sure sparks of the fire are well out and, if the winds pick
up, none of them will flare up,'' Sacher said.
   The fire, which began June 20 during a lightning storm, was
fought in temperatures sometimes exceeding 100 degrees. The fire
cost upwards of $2 million to battle and caused an estimated $4
million damage, officials said.
   About 22 ranchers had permits to graze cattle in the Custer
National Forest, and the fire forced them to seek other grazing
land for their herds.
   Benny and Dorothy Padden, who ranch about 7,000 acres in the
Long Pines area, had about 550 head of cattle on forest land. So
far, nine head have been found dead and nearly half of those who
survived were burned.
   ``The drought was bad enough without the fire,'' said Padden.
``There's too many adversities at one time. We're infested with
grasshoppers, also. They didn't leave any out this year.''
   In Wyoming, the 390 firefighters battling the 1,150-acre fire in
the Shoshone National Forest completed a fire line around the blaze
Tuesday.
   The fire, discovered Friday, was burning inside the Wolf Creek
Timber Sale and had threatened critical grizzly bear and bald eagle
habitats.
   Forest spokesman Tom Portice said firefighters were able to
protect bald eagle nesting sites. The fire should not severely
affect the grizzly bear habitat, he said.
   In northern California's Sonoma County, dry, hilly terrain and
gusty winds hampered firefighters who battled a stubborn fire that
burned four houses and a dozen outbuildings Tuesday. The fire raged
for hours several miles south of Sebastopol and scorched between
200 and 300 acres before firefighters contained it, said Bob
Gloeckner, a director of the Hessel Fire Protection District.
   ``The wind kept picking up hot embers and spotting them ahead of
the fire itself, a quarter mile, half a mile ahead, and starting
additional fires,'' Gloeckner said.
   Earlier in the day, gusts fanned a fire from a downed power line
into an inferno that destroyed a 17-room mansion built 112 years
and an art colony in Preston, a hamlet two miles north of
Cloverdale on the border between Sonoma and Mendocino counties.
   After the flames were quenched, only chimneys and bathtubs
remained of the mansion. The fire also destroyed the textile
artworks of Christina Buffalo Larkin and the paintings of artist
Robert Thomas, album designer for the Grateful Dead.
   Also lost in the fire was Thomas' 30-year collection of antique
and unusual folk music instruments.
   ``This has been a double tragedy,'' said Lisa Ellis, wife of a
ranch manager. ``Not only have we lost the historic buildings, but
the artists colony has been wiped out, an incalculable loss.''
   In southern California, three brush fires broke out in the
afternoon as arid regions sweltered under temperatures that topped
the 100-degree mark. All burned in steep, brushy terrain and were
fanned by winds.
   In San Luis Obispo County, 175 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles, a 200-acre brush fire forced the evacuation of Cerro Alto
Campground and closed Highway 41 between Atascadero and Morro Bay,
said Kim John with the California Department of Forestry. She did
not know how many people had to flee.
   In the desert country near Cabazon, 95 miles east of downtown
Los Angeles, a 125-acre fire burned in Millard Canyon near the
Morongo Indian Reservation. Another blaze, south of Interstate 10
near Cabazon Peak, burned 600 acres and was nearly contained today.
   Firefighters said flames charred about 400 acres of grass and
brush in northwestern Calaveras County and an unknown number of
acres just north of Lakeport in Lake County.
   The Calaveras County blaze for a time threatened the small
community of Paloma, according to the Tuolumne-Calaveras Ranger
Unit. But no buildings were lost, and no injuries were reported.
   In South Bend, Ind., a fire in a wooded area reached a level of
peat moss running from 12 feet to 15 feet deep.
   ``You can't put it out. All you can do is contain it,'' said
state police Sgt. Tom Rubesha. ``This peat is buried. Peat fires
have been known to burn for years.''
   The blaze discovered Saturday had spread to 40 to 60 acres by
Tuesday, authorities said.

<HEAD>Court Rules Government May Finance Religious Groups' Chastity
Programs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 4th graf pvs, Chief Justice, to elaborate on how
religious group receiving federal money could violate Constitution</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ruled the federal
government may give money to religious groups to promote chastity
among America's teen-agers.
   The 5-4 ruling said a 1981 federal law that funnels taxpayer
money to private groups to counsel adolescents against premarital
sex is not unconstitutional on its face.
   But the justices ordered further lower court hearings to
determine whether the statute, as it is being applied, ever may
violate the constitutionally required separation of church and
state.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
if there is evidence that some recipients of federal funds are
violating the Constitution by teaching religious doctrine the
remedy is to ban them from getting further money. The solution is
not to kill the law, Rehnquist said.
   Rehnquist said the so-called teen chastity law has a valid
secular purpose in seeking to eliminate or reduce economic problems
caused by pre-marital sex among young people.
   He said the statute also does not have the primary purpose of
advancing religion and does not create an excessive entanglement
between church and state.
   ``We note, as is proper given the traditional presumption in
favor of the constitutionality of statutes enacted by Congress,
that our conclusion that the statute does not violate the
establishment clause (requiring separation of church and state) is
consistent with the conclusion Congress reached in the course of
its deliberations,'' Rehnquist said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said, ``As
the record developed thus far in this litigation makes all too
clear, federal tax dollars appropriated (under the law) have been
used with government approval to support religious teaching.''
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and John Paul Stevens.
   The law, officially the Adolescent Family Life Act, was passed
by Congress soon after President Reagan took office.
   Former Sen. Jeremiah Denton, R-Ala., sponsored the law; it was
ushered through Congress by fellow conservatives. The act provided
millions of dollars for care, prevention and research.
   Care services include pregnancy testing, maternity counseling,
and adoption and referral help.
   Prevention services are those aimed at discouraging adolescent
sexual relations and include programs offering counseling and
family planning.
   Opponents of the law said religious groups were using the money
to promote Christianity. For example, they said some groups advised
young girls to practice sexual abstinence by pretending that
``Jesus is their date.''
   Supporters of the law said it is in line with federal aid to
religious organizations that sponsor other worthy social services
such as hospital care, drug abuse programs, orphanages and
emergency shelters.
   In seeking funds, applicants are required to describe how they
will ``involve religious and charitable organizations, voluntary
associations and other groups in the private sector.''
   U.S. District Judge Charles Richey in Washington struck down key
provisions of the law in April 1987. Richey said the law had a
primary effect of advancing religion and fostered an excessive
entanglement between government and religion.
   The judge left intact provisions of the law that did not involve
giving money to religious groups.
   The administration said the law is needed to combat teen
pregancy. More than one million teen-age girls become pregnant each
year and about 500,000 have abortions.
   The law was challenged by a group of taxpayers, clery members
and the American Jewish Congress. They were represented by the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   Planned Parenthood, the American Psychological Association, the
National Organization for Women and the National Abortion Rights
Action League were among the groups that attacked the law.
   Supporters of the statute include the U.S. Catholic Conference,
the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights and United
Families of America.
   The case is Bowen vs. Kendrick, 87-253.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
subpoenaed records from at least six brokerages and is seeking
Swiss cooperation in a probe of alleged insider trading by a rookie
securities analyst and a wealthy Hong Kong businessman, the SEC
said today.
   ``We've sent subpoenas to a number of firms,'' Thomas Newkirk,
the commission's chief litigation counsel, said from Washington.
``The reason we'e doing this is to check the defendants' trading
records. We're not investigating the firms themselves.''
   Newkirk said he did not know the number of firm records
subpoenaed. But SEC officials familiar with the investigation, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said that besides Morgan Stanley &
Co., subpoenas were sent to Goldman Sachs & Co., First Boston Co.,
Merrill Lynch & Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Charles Schwab
& Co.
   The SEC has accused Morgan Stanley securities analyst Stephen
Wang Jr., 24, of leaking inside information about at least 25
corporate takeovers in which Morgan Stanley played a role to Fred
C. Lee. Lee, 38, a wealthy Hong Kong-based investor who had
numerous trading accounts on Wall Street, also has a home in the
Washington suburb of McLean, Va.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder told a Senate subcommittee today
that his agency has asked Swiss authorities to provide information
on trades emanating from that country that the SEC believes
involved Lee.
   Ruder, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee's
securities subcommittee, said the SEC also is involved in ``active
negotiations to possibly freeze assets in Switzerland'' controlled
by Lee.
   Ruder would not discuss how much money the trades involved or
the value of the assets.
   At the same hearing, SEC enforcement chief Gary Lynch said the
agency has 40 to 50 investigations under way involving foreign
trading, including one that ``involves very large dollar amounts.''
   The commission claims Lee made at least $19 million by trading
on that information and shared $200,000 with Wang. It has demanded
the two repay the money plus triple damages for a total of $76
million, the second-biggest insider tradin case after the $100
million Ivan F. Boesky scandal.
   In a complaint filed Monday in Manhattan federal court, the SEC
also obtained an order freezing the assets of both men.
   Wang's attorney, Ira L. Sorkin, has declined to comment on the
accusations other than to say he's studying them. Lee's attorney
Michael Perlis was quoted in today's New York Times as saying his
client intends to resist the accusations.
   ``They want to make him out to be another Ivan Boesky, but he's
far from that,'' Perlis told the newspaper.
   Perlis also said, ``We told the SEC that we would be willing to
sign a consent decree on reasonable terms.'' Under a consent
decree, a defendant generally may settle charges, sometimes paying
a penalty, without admitting or denying guilt.
   The Wang-Lee case has raised major questions about Wall Street's
self-policing efforts in the aftermath of the insider-trading
uproar created by Boesky, formerly one of the securities industry's
best-known speculators.
   Boesky settled insider trading charges in November 1986 by
returning $50 million in illicit profits and paying $50 million in
penalties. In addition, he was banished from securities trading for
life and was sentenced to a three-year prison term for conspiring
to lie to the SEC.

   James E. Davis, the new president of the nation's
largest doctors' organization, on Wednesday called for a renewed
emphasis on the service ethic in medicine.
   Davis, a surgeon from Durham, N.C., was to be sworn in Wednesday
as president of the American Medical Association during the group's
annual policy-making convention.
   In a speech prepared for delivery at his inauguration, Davis
proposed that county and state doctors' associations organize and
staff _ free of charge _ medical ombudsman offices to serve the
public.
   ``They will receive the public's questions, concerns,
suggestions and recommendations about health matters and follow
through on consumer complaints,'' he said.
   ``We must get a handle on the high cost of health care,'' Davis
said. ``We must find solutions to the drug crisis and other
frightening conditions that plague so many American adolescents. We
must develop ways to reach out and care for the medically
indigent.''
   Davis is a history buff, fascinated by the Civil War. He became
involved in the leadership of organized medicine partly through his
interest in parliamentary procedure.
   After serving as president and speaker of the House of Delegates
of the North Carolina Medical Society, he was elected vice speaker
and then speaker of the AMA's House of Delegates.
   In his spare time, he is writing a brief reference manual on
parliamentary procedure for presiding officers.
   Davis succeeds Dr. William Hotchkiss of Chesapeake, Va., as
president of the AMA.

   A Czech dissident author was denied
permission to attend an international disarmament conference that
opened Wednesday in Sweden, according to a news report.
   Vaclav Havel said in a letter to the organizers that his latest
application for a passport was ``rejected on the grounds that my
traveling abroad was not in the state's interest,'' the TT Swedish
news agency said.
   It said Havel wrote that he has not been issued a passport for
19 years.
   About 900 peace activists and academics are in the southern city
of Lund for the four-day conference, organized by the European
Nuclear Disarmament movement.
   Last week, the leader of a banned Polish peace group also was
denied a passport to attend the conference. Allowed to attend the
meeting, however, was Jacek Kuron, an adviser to the outlawed
Solidarity trade union.

   The government on Wednesday lifted a
ban on fishing in Lake Lugano, the last health measure still in
force after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.
   Recent tests showed radioactivity in fish in the southern lake
had dropped to a safe level, the Swiss Interior Ministry said.
   Fishing, banned since September 1986, will be allowed starting
July 9.
   Levels of radioactive cesium in the fish were nearly 100 times
the current level after the disaster at the nuclear plant in the
Soviet Union, the ministry said.
   About 70 professional fishers on Lake Lugano will receive
government compensation for income lost during the ban.
   The Chernobyl accident showered Western Europe with a
radioactive cloud, prompting health measures in many countries.

   Each morning, Israel Zamora reports to
the job exchange hoping a farmer needs him and his family to hoe
weeds competing with the lucrative sugar beet crop.
   Migrant laborers are in demand in the Red River Valley between
Minnesota and North Dakota, even more so this year as farmers try
to salvage a cash crop that could determine if they survive or fail.
   ``It's too hot. There's not enough rain. A lot of the fields are
too dry, so it's dirty,'' said Zamora, 40, of Weslaco, Texas,
showing his calloused, nicked-up hands.
   ``But we're poor. This is how we make our living. We never know
what's going to happen the next day.''
   Zamora was given the name of a farmer and directions to his
place. Then he headed off with his family in a tattered white Ford
van that survived the three-day journey from Texas. For the next 12
hours, they hoed weeds for $30 an acre.
   Hundreds more migrants than usual, almost all of them from the
parched lands of Texas, made the 1,500-mile trip in pickups and
vans to find seasonal work in Minnesota. Thanks to unusual weather,
they found more work than normal.
   ``Everybody's working, and I have 50 farmers waiting for more
laborers. Weeds don't know there's a drought,'' said Armando
Cuellar, counselor for the state's Job Service Division in
Crookston.
   ``I've never had this much labor available, but this is the year
I'm shortest on labor. I'm hearing from growers who never used
migrant laborers,'' Cuellar said.
   The worst drought in 50 years is only one problem facing the
beets, which ripen into tannish-white bulbs that produce sugar. A
May 13 frost killed much of the first planting, so farmers had to
try again. High winds hampered the second seeding, and survivors
are enduring the drought and an onslaught of weeds.
   Farmers spray chemicals to control weeds, which suck up moisture
from the ground and keep it from the beets. But the herbicides
don't work unless it rains. If it rains now, the weeds grow twice
as fast as the beets.
   ``If the chemicals don't kill the weeds, the laborers will.
They're like insurance to an automobile owner,'' said Pablo
Guajardo of the Job Service Division in Moorhead.
   The Red River flows north into Canada through a lush
200-mile-long valley that was once the bed of a glacial lake. The
heavy, rich soil is among the most fertile in the world.
   Sugar beets are a $1 billion industry in the valley, which
produces about 20 percent of the sugar made in the United States.
About 12 percent of the U.S. total comes from an 1,800-member
cooperative called the American Sugar Crystal Co., which expects
the yield to be down substantially this year because of the drought.
   Crop projections are 16 tons per acre on 366,000 acres, down
from last year's yield of 19 tons per acre, according to Ron Hayes,
president of American Crystal.
   But the beets have fared better than wheat, barley and other
light grains on the parched prairie, so growers are concentrating
on them.
   ``You can't dare abandon the sugar beets at this point,'' said
Evert Schumacher, Polk County executive of the state's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service. ``That's all the hope these
farmers got.''
   About 4,400 migrants are in Moorhead, including 1,400 who are
laborers. They arrived in April and May but had no work early
because of the weather.
   However, with the late start and and the drought, they'll
probably have work into August.
   The migrants normally get paid $22 an acre, or a minimum of $5
an hour. Because of the increased demand, some are getting $30 to
$35 an acre, and a good hoer can work two acres per day, seven days
a week.
   At the job exchange, men with folded arms sat in chairs against
a wall at a former high school, looking like anxious students
waiting to see the principal. They waited for word on work and
talked about the weather. Barefoot children scurried about or drew
pictures on papers.
   ``It's a pretty bad year. Too many weeds,'' said Rodolfo
Gonzalez, 46, wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap. ``One
good thing about the drought, though. No mosquitoes.''
   Bennie Hernandez had just driven 14 hours from Wyoming because
he heard there were jobs here. After this job, he'll go to Iowa to
hack weeds with a machete in the soybean fields.
   ``You don't know from one day to the next. We just move and hope
to find work,'' Hernandez said.
   The work is exhausting. Workers chop at knee-high weeds along
straight rows of beets, stopping occasionally for water. The lunch
break lasts 30 minutes.
   The migrants took a chance on the drought-stricken north because
job opportunities are scarcer in Texas.
   ``At least up here they have hope. The economy in Texas is not
the best. There's nothing down there to begin with,'' said Guajardo.
   The migrants don't harvest the beets. That's done by machine in
October, when the crop is cut into slices like french fries and
mixed with water to remove the sugar.
   Farmers who have given up on their grain crops are keeping their
fingers crossed on sugar beets.
   Gerald Olsonawski of Kittson County, who plowed under 1,400
acres of failed wheat. He has 321 acres of beets. ``That's my last
hope. That's all I got to go on.''

   An evangelical pastor was sentenced to
three years in prison for killing a 17-year-old girl while trying
to drive an evil spirit out of her body, the Daily Nation reported
Wednesday.
   John Kimutai Korir, leader of a sect called the Church of God,
denied he tried to murder Jane Chepkemoi, who had escaped from a
mental institution and was the daughter of a church member, the
newspaper said.
   At Korir's trial in the western town of Nakuru, state counsel
Horace Okumu described the exorcism rite:
   ``The churchman asked for a panga (machete knife), cut open
(her) chest and removed the lungs. Korir then placed the lungs in
Jane's mouth, on pretext that he was chasing away the demons.''
   The pastor and his followers then left the girl and continued to
pray for her nearby. When they returned, she was dead.

<HEAD>New Jersey Governor To Give Keynote Speech At GOP Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New Jersey's popular Gov. Thomas Kean, known
for his call to bring women and minorities into the GOP mainstream,
said today he will deliver the keynote speech at the Republican
National Convention.
   ``The Republican Party, if it's going to be successful, has to
appeal to everybody,'' Kean said. ``That's the message'' he said he
will present to GOP delegates Aug. 15 in New Orleans.
   Kean, 53, one of the party's rising stars, was picked to give
the high-profile speech by Vice President George Bush, the expected
Republican presidential nominee, sources told The Associated Press.
   The Democrats, whose convention is next month in Atlanta,
announced the selection of their keynote speaker, Texas State
Treasurer Ann Richards, on Monday.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush
decided on Kean in large measure due to the governor's
party-expanding philosophy, outlined in Kean's recent book, ``The
Politics of Inclusion.'' In the book, Kean talks about ways to
reach beyond the GOP's traditional wealthy, white-collar base.
   Kean, one of New Jersey's most popular governors, was
resoundingly re-elected in 1985 with an unprecedented 60 percent of
the black vote. Four years earlier, he had squeaked into the
governor's job by the slimmest margin ever.
   The re-election victory in an otherwise dull political year cast
Kean into his party's limelight and put him in demand around the
country as a speaker. In 1986, Republican governors chose Kean to
head their national association.
   The sources said Kean clinched the sought-after speaking role at
a meeting with Bush in Ohio last week, when the governor delivered
a talk outlining strategy against Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the expected Democratic nominee.
   Bush and Kean have met privately several times to discuss
strategy in recent months.
   Kean's spokesman, Carl Golden, declined Tuesday to comment on
the selection of the governor as keynote speaker.
   New Jersey's state Assembly Speaker Charles Hardwick, a
Republican, called Kean's selection ``great news for New Jersey and
the Republican Party.
   ``The governor's message is one that will be well received
around the country,'' said Hardwick, who also serves as
vice-chairman for the GOP convention's platform-writing committee.
   Kean has also been mentioned as a potential running mate for
Bush. But Kean, on a unrelated trip here Tuesday, said, ``I'm doing
everything I can to make sure he doesn't come to me.''
   A Kean-Bush ticket would match two millionaires, both with Ivy
League educations, and both from the Northeast. Kean has said,
however, he would be hard pressed to decline a place on the ticket
if asked.

<HEAD>Resurgent Iraq Believes War With Iran Nearing End</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A series of morale-boosting victories has
given Iraq the edge in its war with Iran and convinced Iraqis the
8-year-old conflict has entered its final phase.
   ``The situation has improved a lot from an Iraqi standpoint,''
said Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoun. ``Time is not on Iran's
side, which was the perception before.
   ``We think we are in the last phase of the war, a phase where
the Iranians have begun a significant deterioration in their
internal affairs _ caused by their military defeats.''
   The string of successful Iraqi military operations began in
April, when Iraq recaptured the important southern oil terminal at
Faw in a 36-hour battle.
   That was followed by victories in the southern Shalamcheh area
in May _ which took only nine hours _ and another nine-hour battle
Saturday that recovered the oil-rich Majnoon islands near the
southern city of Basra.
   Also in June, Iraq announced it had driven Iranian forces from
several strategic mountaintops in its northern Kurdistan province.
That left only a handful of Iranian positions in Iraqi territory.
   Military experts in Baghdad who visited some of the recaptured
areas were astonished at the speed of the Iraqi offensives and what
appeared to be the lack of stiff Iranian resistance.
   ``Shalamcheh should have taken days, if not weeks, to retake,''
said one Western military man in the Iraqi capital.
   ``The bubble has burst for the Iranians,'' said a diplomat.
``For five or six years they have been on the verge of winning. Now
every Iranian knows there have been major battlefield reverses. It
has had a great impact on Iranian morale.''
   The victories have sparked new optimism here.
   President Saddam Hussein told his troops after the victory at
Majnoon that they had won the most difficult of battles needed to
end the war.
   Official slogans suggest the Iraqis feel the end of the fight
against Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's forces is near.
   ``The official announcement of victory will be soon, God
willing,'' said one sign near the front at Majnoon.
   ``We are convinced that the outcome of the war will be decided
in the coming days, weeks or months,'' Deputy Premier Taha Yassin
Ramadhan was quoted as saying last week.
   ``Khomeini and Khomeinism cannot survive for long,'' said
Hamdoun. ``Its defeats at the front are a key to its overall
defeat. Without Iraq (as an enemy), Khomeini cannot survive.''
   It was not clear if Baghdad's battlefield successes resulted
from a new-found military prowess or a crumbling Iranian will to
fight. There have been growing signs of disarray in Iran.
   Western military analysts have noted increasing desertions in
the military and Tehran's difficulty recruiting soldiers. The issue
of new identity cards in Iran is seen largely as an effort to crack
down on draft dodgers.
   The conduct of the war also has come under critical scrutiny in
the press and political infighting continues.
   On June 2, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani was appointed
commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces to end bickering and
reorganize the military.
   The National Liberation Army of Iran, an Iraqi-backed rebel
force, say many of the more than 2,000 prisoners they hold
surrendered easily after only brief resistance.
   Some observers speculate that once Baghdad has recovered the few
pockets of Iraqi territory still in Iranian hands, mostly in the
mountainous north, the war will come to a de facto end, the
pre-1980 borders having been re-established.
   The Iraqis concede there is no movement at all on the diplomatic
front, but cling to U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 as the
only solution to the conflict.
   That resolution, accepted by Iraq after its passage in July, has
been neither accepted nor rejected by Iran. It calls for a
cease-fire, withdrawal to original borders, exchange of prisoners
and determination of who was responsible for starting the war.
   Had Iran accepted the resolution and begun negotiations, it may
have been able to extract concessions from Iraq in return for the
captured territory. Now it has lost the territory and has nothing
concrete to show for it.
   ``Iraq cannot accept just a cease-fire,'' Hamdoun said. ``We
think that after eight years of war, you either continue or settle
the war once and for all. You can't have a no-peace situation and
maintain the necessary manpower.''
   Iraq has little faith in the United Nations' ability to mediate
peace, pointing to 20 years of failure in the Arab-Israeli
conflict, and has even less faith in outside mediators.
   Conventional wisdom has been that Iran, with its larger
population and greater resources, could outlast Iraq in a war of
attrition. That has not been the case.
   ``Iraq has shown it has the staying power,'' said a Western
diplomat. ``It's lived through the worst and shown it can tough it
out.''

   Making a contribution to society is far
more important than earning a hefty salary, a poll of U.S. high
school student leaders has found.
   Delegates to the National Association of Student Councils
conference in Albuquerque were asked Tuesday what would be most
important to them at age 40.
   Fifty-two percent selected ``having made a contribution to
society;'' 20 percent chose ``a successful first marriage;'' 18
percent picked ``being a better parent than the generation that
raised me;'' and 10 percent reported ``making a lot of money.''
   The conference's sponsors say the findings show a definite shift
in values among America's youth.
   ``During the past three years students have been moving away
from money as a measure of success and focusing upon societal
contributions as their prime measure of achievement as an adult,''
said Dale Hawley, director of student activities for the National
Association of Secondary School Principals, the conference sponsor.
   ``When we asked this question at a similar conference four years
ago, students indicated making money was their primary measure of
success,'' Hawley said.
   The 1,500 delegates from across the county also cited alcohol
overwhelmingly as the most frequently used drug by their peers.
Eighty-nine percent chose alcohol, 9 percent chose cigarettes, 2
percent chose marijuana, and less than 1 percent cited hard drugs
like cocaine. Figures were rounded off so they totaled more than
100 percent.
   Delegates reported they see considerable cheating in school.
Sixty-six percent said they see cheating frequently, 33 percent
said infrequently and 1 percent said they never saw any cheating.

<HEAD>House Bill Bans Road Funds for Shopping Center Near Civil War Site</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday approved a measure
prohibiting federal involvement in road projects for a disputed
shopping center scheduled to be built next to a Civil War
battlefield in northern Virginia.
   The provision, included in a $10.8 billion transportation bill
approved by the House, prevents federal money from being used for
the planning, design or construction of bypasses or access roads
associated with the William Center development just west of
Washington in Prince William County, Va.
   The development is being opposed by local groups who say it
would be detrimental to the adjacent Manassas National Battlefield
Park.
   ``This is designed to indicate Congress' interest in this piece
of land,'' said Tad Boggs, an aide to Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y.,
who sponsored the provision. ``This is a shot across the
developer's bow, and is intended to buy us time until we come up
with a plan to purchase the land.''
   The bill is the first piece of legislation passed by the House
that attempts to stop the 542-acre development, which historians
claim would violate the sanctity of the 4,600-acre park where two
major Civil War battles were fought.
   The project's developers have offered to help pay for road
construction, but federal funds usually are needed for a project of
this size to be completed. Mrazek's provision prohibits federal
involvement in road bypasses or alterations associated with
Interstate 66, which runs adjacent to the park, and U.S. 29 and
state route 234, which run through the battle site.
   The project, proposed by the Hazel-Peterson Cos., would feature
a 1.2 million-square-foot shopping center, 1.7 million-square-feet
of office space and 560 homes. John T. Hazel, president of the
development group, first proposed a much smaller office park for
the space, but upgraded his plans once county officials relaxed
zoning requirements for the tract.
   Mrazek is a co-sponsor of another House bill that would take
control of the development tract and add it to the boundaries of
the park. That measure is scheduled to be voted on by a House
Interior and Insular Affairs panel Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The largest display ever of the
magical creations of filmmaker George Lucas opens Thursday just a
few miles from the movie studio where his fantasies come alive.
   Visitors can see Han Solo, frozen into a block of carbon like a
coffin figure from ``The Empire Strikes Back,'' Luke Skywalker's
Landspeeder from ``Star Wars,'' the Ark of the Covenant from
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and a half-size Jabba the Hutt from
``Return of the Jedi.''
   The five-day show at Marin County's annual fair is free except
for fair admission.
   It has the look of an exhibit of pop culture as much as a
showing of Lucas' galaxy of special effects.
   Explanations are written on cards at each display, but most are
surely recognizable to even the least avid movie-goer. There is
Wicket on his Ewok hang glider, Darth Vader and his Imperial
Shuttle Craft, a stooped Yoda and the Star Wars storm troopers.
   ``We're putting out for the first time on this kind of scale the
very things which dreams and wishes are made of,'' said Judy Niles,
spokeswoman for Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic, the
special-effects division of his movie-making empire.
   There also are mockups of Solo's clunker spaceship and Vader's
super-star destroyer; the Imperial At-At, or All Terrain Attack
Transport; the TaunTaun snow lizard; and the Imperial Scout
anti-grav Speeder Bike.
   In one corner of the 15,000-square-foot round auditorium, Vader
stands next to the Deathstar Battle Station.
   Nearby, where they will pose for pictures with guests, stand
C3PO and R2D2, Skywalker's mechanical sidekicks.
   ``This is a collection of giant flashes of imagination, all
inspired by Lucas,'' said Steve Gawley, model shop project
supervisor at Industrial Light and Magic in San Rafael, 15 miles
north of San Francisco.
   ``I think people will come here to try and see how their heroes
were created,'' said Gawley, who has worked for Lucas 13 years.
   Besides Lucas' creations, Industrial Light and Magic also has
created special effects for scores of other hit movies. The Klingon
Bird of Prey from ``Star Trek III'' is displayed, along with a
model of the DeLorean Time Machine from ``Back to the Future.''
   All the movie props were taken from a giant warehouse employees
call The Archive.
   Many were falling apart, and had to be repaired.
   ``These models die a little bit every time you move them,'' said
Niles. ``I doubt that we'll ever again be able to put on a show
this large. Certainly not one that's more than just a few miles
from our studio.''
   The same crew that handles lighting, makeup and costuming for
ILM arranged the display, which includes a star backdrop and videos
showing how the various items appeared on the big screen.
   Models of the spacecraft are startling in detail, not all of it
done in the utmost seriousness.
   Look in the cockpit of one, for example, and you'll see a
miniature Playboy poster, in another a NASA emblem. One has a sea
anchor on the outside of a space destroyer.

   Two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter
jets crashed in the air today and exploded, an air force
spokeswoman said. The accident occurred less than two hours after
another F-16 crashed into the Black Forest.
   West German police said one pilot was killed in the in-flight
crash.
   The Air Force spokeswoman, Capt. Gail Hayes, said the aircraft
were on a training mission when they crashed near Bodenheim, about
six miles south of Mainz.
   She said the aircraft, assigned to the 50th Tactical Fighter
Wing at Hahn Air Base, crashed at 1:30 p.m.
   ``There was one person aboard each aircraft. The condition of
those on board is unknown,'' Ms. Hayes told The Associated Press in
a telephone interview from U.S. Air Force European headquarters at
Ramstein Air Base.
   West German police spokesman Hugo Lenxweiler told the AP in a
telephone interview that one of the pilots was killed in the
accident.
   ``The other pilot was able to eject safely,'' Lenxweiler said.
   Lenxweiler said he did not know if the pilot who ejected
suffered any injuries. Identities of the pilots were not
immediately released. He said the planes crashed within several
hundred yards of a populated area but that no one on the ground was
hurt.
   He said preliminary information indicated that one of the F-16s
rammed the other from behind. Both planes exploded on impact, he
said.
   The other crash occurred about 90 miles away.
   Air Force Spokesman 1st Lt. Al Sattler said the pilot in the
Black Forest crash ejected safely before the crash and was taken to
Ramstein Air Base to be examined.
   Police in Karlsruhe said the crash occurred at noon (6 a.m. EDT)
near the village of Marxzell-Burbach.
   Sattler said the aircraft was from the 52nd Tactical Fighter
Wing, stationed at Spangdahlen Air Base.
   The aircraft was taking part in a NATO military tactical air
exercise being conducted from the Canadian air force base in
Baden-Soellingen, Sattler said.
   West German police and U.S. military personnel secured the area
of the crashes, and teams of experts were sent to the accident
sites to determine the cause of the crashes.

   Mothers have the greatest influence in getting
children to wear auto safety belts, while fathers often set a bad
example, according to a survey of the nation's school children.
   The survey, released Wednesday, showed 79 percent of those
interviewed believe seat belts save lives, and more children wear
seat belts than the parents who accompany them.
   Of the 1,118 children interviewed by Louis Harris and Associates
for the American Coalition of Traffic Safety, 58 percent said they
wear seat belts all or most of the time, while 57 percent said
their mothers regularly wear seat belts and only 38 percent said
their fathers buckle up.
   ACTS, which has a $1.5 million annual budget, was set up by the
U.S. auto industry in 1986 to support safety belt use.
   Among the youngsters surveyed, 30 percent said they use seat
belts all of the time, 28 percent ``most of the time'' and 33
percent sometimes, with 9 percent saying they never wear them.
   Pollsters interviewed children in grades 5-7 across the country
in late April and May. Pollsters, who talked to children in their
schools, claimed a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.
   ``I can't believe I got out of that car alive,'' said 9-year-old
Nicole Rabello of Whiting, N.J., an accident victim who was one of
37 children presented at a news conference announcing the survey
results. All the children were saved because of seat belts,
according to ACTS officials.
   Blown-up photographs of smashed cars, including the
Mercedes-Benz in which Nicole was riding, provided a backdrop.
   Eleven-year-old Frederick D. Thompson of Washington, D.C., said
that he has only forgotten to put on his seat belt once since his
crash, and his father quickly reminded him.
   ``If I was not wearing my safety belt, my head would have gone
through the window of the car,'' Frederick said.
   Susan Akin, Miss America for 1986, accompanied the children, and
recounted that a seat belt saved her life in a 1987 Mississippi
crash involving her car and an 18-wheel truck.
   ``One rainy day I was in a hospital with blood running down my
face,'' said Miss Akin. She said family cried when they saw her
covered with blood, but ``thank goodness they were not tears
looking down on me dead.''
   Miss Akin said since the crash, which left only a small scar on
her nose, she has volunteered her time to promote the use of seat
belts.
   Phil Haseltine, ACTS executive director, said the survey showed
that parents are a greater influence on safety belt use than
entertainers, sports figures or police officers involved in safety
campaigns.
   ``But fathers don't look too good here,'' said Haseltine.
   The survey said 48 percent of those surveyed wished their
parents would use seat belts more often, while 68 percent worry
about their parents being killed in an auto accident. Only 38
percent said they worry about dying in a car crash themselves.
   The survey said 83 percent of the children interviewed correctly
identified whether their states are among the 32 with mandatory
seat belt laws. The District of Columbia also has such a law.
   The survey said safety belt use is signficantly higher among
children in states with laws than in states without them _ 64
percent versus 37 percent.

<HEAD>Old Drug Appears First Effective Treatment for Cirrhosis</HEAD>

   A medicine widely used for gout appears to
dramatically slow the lethal destruction of cirrhosis, but doctors
disagree over whether it should become routine treatment for this
major killer.
   In a report published Thursday, a team of Mexican researchers
said they found ``a striking, consistent, statistically significant
benefit'' of the drug colchicine. After 10 years, more than half of
those who got the medicine were alive, compared with less than a
quarter of the people in an untreated comparison group.
   Earlier versions of the 14-year study have been published and
presented at medical meetings over the years, and many U.S. experts
are familiar with the work. Despite the impressive results,
however, opinion is divided.
   Some believe colchicine should be used for cirrhosis, despite
flaws in the Mexican research, because the drug is clearly safe and
inexpensive. Others contend that more research is necessary to
prove that it works.
   Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver that usually results from
alcohol abuse or chronic viral infections. It is the ninth leading
cause of death among U.S. adults, killing about 20,000 people
annually.
   According to the World Health Organization, it accounts for 13
deaths for each 100,000 people annually in the United States, and
as high as 32 in Italy and 42 in Hungary.
   Until now, doctors treating cirrhosis have been able to do
little except encourage patients to stop drinking.
   ``We are the first ones to show that you can really do something
for the cirrhosis patient,'' said Dr. Marcos Rojkind, who directed
the latest study at the Salvador Zubiran National Institute for
Nutrition in Mexico City.
   He concluded that colchicine stops the progression of cirrhosis
and in some cases even seems to reverse the disease. Colchicine is
widely used to treat gout, a hereditary form of arthritis caused by
excess uric acid in the blood and it attacks joints in the hands
and feet.
   Rojkind, who is now at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in
New York, said he believes colchicine works by reducing
inflammation in the liver and preventing the release of a growth
factor that promotes the formation of connective tissue.
   In an editorial published with the study in the New England
Journal of Medicine, Drs. James L. Boyer and David F. Ransohoff of
Yale Medical School pointed out shortcomings in the study. Among
other things, they noted that those who received the drug were not
as sick as those in the comparison group.
   ``These questions about chance, bias and biologic factors tend
to weaken an endorsement of what is otherwise the most impressive
outcome yet described for any treatment of patients with
cirrhosis,'' they wrote.
   They said more research is needed. Dr. Jay Hoffnagle of the
National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases
agreed.
   ``It's the type of work that needs to be repeated to show that
it's a reproducible finding,'' he said.
   Hoffnagle said the drug should not be routinely used for
cirrhosis, and he said he believes that many U.S. experts are
skeptical of the findings.
   However, Dr. Thomas Lamont of Boston University Medical Center
said he thinks colchicine should be offered now to victims of the
disease.
   ``While it's a flawed study,'' he said, ``we have no other
simple medical therapy for this disease. Coupled with abstinence
from alcohol, which we firmly believe in, this therapy is certainly
worth further consideration.''
   Dr. Marhsall Kaplan of New England Medical Center has
successfully used the drug to treat a rare form of the disease
called primary biliary cirrhosis, and he agreed that colchicine
should be used for cirrhosis resulting from alcoholism and other
causes.
   ``If a drug seems to have a benefit and doesn't have any risk
and is inexpensive _ and with colchicine all of these things are
true _ it's probably reasonable to try it,'' he said.
   In the study, 54 patients were randomly assigned to take
colchicine, while 46 got placebo pills. After five years, 75
percent of the colchicine patients were alive, compared with 34
percent of the placebo group. After 10 years, the survival rate in
the two groups was 56 percent and 20 percent.
   Biopsies seemed to show improvement in nine of those who got
colchicine. In two of them, their livers had returned to normal,
while in seven others there was minimal scarring.
   The two major side effects of the treatment were diarrhea and
gastritis, or inflammation of the stomach.

<HEAD>WHO Panel: Companies Shouldn't Screen Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of health and employment experts concluded
Wednesday that most workers do not risk getting AIDS at work, and
it advised companies against screening current or prospective
employees for AIDS or the HIV virus.
   The 36-member panel, meeting under the auspices of the World
Health Organization and the International Labor Organization, also
recommended that workers suffering from AIDS or those infected with
the AIDS virus be given the same access to health benefits as other
workers.
   It said employees should feel ``no obligation'' to inform their
employers whether they have acquired immune deficiency syndrome or
are infected with HIV, which causes the deadly disease.
   The panel, representing 18 countries, also said HIV infection
was not a reason to fire an employee. It recommended that
``reasonable alternative working arrangements should be made'' if a
worker's ability to do his job is impaired by AIDS.
   The panel approved the guidelines for governments, employers and
employees during a three-day meeting. It recommended that companies
and national governments should develop ``consistent policies and
procedures'' as soon as possible.
   The document says that ``in the vast majority of occupations and
occupational settings, work does not involve a risk of acquiring or
transmitting HIV between workers, from worker to client, or from
client to worker.''
   It reiterated that the three known ways the HIV virus can be
transmitted are through sexual intercourse, through blood and from
infected mothers to their infants.
   Jonathan Mann, head of the WHO's AIDS program, told a press
conference that the guidelines did not apply to workers where AIDS
transmission might be a risk, such as in health care, among
emergency medical personnel, and in some cases police and
firefighters. He said a meeting on such occupations would be held
later this year.
   Mann said about 90 percent of the estimated 5 million to 10
million HIV-infected people worldwide are of working age. ``It is
in everybody's interest that HIV-infected people work,'' he said.
   The panel also concluded:
   _ Screening prospective employees for HIV or AIDS to determine
whether they are fit to work is unnecessary and should not be
required. Pre-employment screening for insurance or other purposes
``raises serious concerns about discrimination and merits close and
further scrutiny.''
   _ Screening employees or asking questions about tests already
taken should not be required.
   _ Workers who are infected, ``or perceived to be ... must be
protected from stigmatization and discrimination by co-workers,
unions, employers or clients.'' This is best done through education
programs, it said.

<HEAD>Dance Theater of Harlem Premieres New Arthur Mitchell Work</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After captivating audiences in the Soviet Union
with its magical retelling of the ``Firebird'' and other ballets,
the Dance Theater of Harlem has returned home as part of the First
New York International Festival of the Arts.
   The 20-year-old company opened Tuesday night at City Center
Theater with the world premiere of Arthur Mitchell's ``John
Henry.'' Using various versions of the American folk tune by the
same name, and traditional gospel hymns and spirituals, the dance
retells the legend of the ``steel-drivin' man'' and the times in
which he lived.
   As artistic director and co-founder of the youthful dance
company, Mitchell has staged an energetic dance that utilizes
modern ballet moves and steps with a folk flavor _ there's even a
Texas two-step thrown in.
   Eddie J. Shellman, whose barrel turns and leaps have made him a
stand-out in the company, portrays John Henry. He is a strong
dancer, whose forcefulness does not obliterate his grace. He is
partnered well with Yvonne Hall, who dances the part of John
Henry's perky girlfriend.
   Theara Ward, a young dancer who has a wonderful technical
astuteness in neoclassical ballets, stretches her style as John
Henry's mother. Her moves, though sustained, are nevertheless in
the folk tradition. Lowell Smith is the father.
   Mitchell has placed his musicians, singer and conductor on
stage, which is just fine and supports the folkiness of the piece.
However, when he adds youngsters who gather around to hear Leon
Bibbs sing the legend of John Henry, the stage becomes somewhat
cluttered and some of the dancers and moves are hidden.
   The Dance Theater of Harlem prides itself on preserving American
dance repertory, and does an excellent job of presenting works that
otherwise would disappear because they are not performed. The
company also is good at demonstrating a variety of styles and moods
from the classical ``Swan Lake'' to the neoclassical ``Serenade''
to the contemporary and ethnic ``Dougla.''
   ``John Henry'' is a good addition to the company's repertory,
but it is not necessarily one of its strongest works.
   ``John Henry'' was commissioned by the arts festival, and
Mitchell said it was a tribute to actor-singer-writer Paul Robeson,
``who was a kind of American folk hero, and to John Henry who is an
Amercan folk hero.''
   The company also performed Eugene Loring's ``Billy the Kid,''
with music by Aaron Copland, and the very lyrical ``Serenade,'' a
work choreographed by the late George Ballanchine in 1934 to
Tchaikovsky's ``Serenade for Strings.'' It was the first work
created by the great ballet master in America.
   Mitchell was a principal dancer with Balanchine's New York City
Ballet.
   The company last appeared at City Center in 1984 and made its
Metropolitan Opera House debut in 1985. It toured in Moscow,
Leningrad and Tbilisi, the home of Ballanchine's brother, Andrei
Balanchivadze, in May and June.
   The Dance Theater of Harlem performs at City Center through July
3. The second program includes Michel Fokine's ``Polovetsian Dances
From `Prince Igor,''' originally created for the second act of
Borodin's opera; Valerie Beattis' ``Streetcar Named Desire''; and
John Taras' stunning ``Firebird,'' set to the original Igor
Stravinsky score.

<HEAD>Terrorist Group Vows to Kill More Americans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Terrorists who claimed responsibility for
a the car-bomb assassination of a U.S. military attache said
Wednesday they will continue killing Americans until the Pentagon
abandons its bases in Greece.
   Police said they had no leads in the death of Navy Capt. William
E. Nordeen, 51. He was killed Tuesday when a vehicle laden with
explosives exploded as his armor-plated car passed it 100 yards
from his home in the Kifissia suburb north of Athens.
   Deputy Premier Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas said Greek police need
better equipment and anti-terrorism training to combat the leftist
group November 17, which has taken responsibility for 11 unsolved
political killings in Greece over 13 years.
   The explosion tore the top off Nordeen's car and hurled his
decapitated body into the front yard of an unoccupied home on
Deliyanni Street, where several Western embassy personnel live. He
and his wife, Patricia, had been scheduled to leave Greece next
month after a three-year tour.
   ``We are at a standstill in the investigation. We have no leads
at this time,'' said a senior police officer in Athens, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   November 17 claimed responsibility in a statement published
Wednesday in the left-wing daily Ethnos, which did not say how it
obtained the document. A red star was stenciled on each of the five
typewritten pages.
   ``We decided to execute one of the higher officers of the
military forces of American imperialism in our country'' and will
continue making targets of Americans ``until the last Turkish
soldier leaves Cyprus and the last American soldier leaves our
country,'' the statement said.
   Many Greeks feel the United States could have stopped Turkey
from invading Cyprus in July 1974 after a short-lived coup led by
Greek officers. Turkey has about 30,000 soldiers in the northern
third of the eastern Mediterranean island, where ethnic Turkish
Cypriots have declared a separate state.
   In its statement, November 17 described U.S. military forces in
Greece as ``an occupation force'' and demanded ``the immediate
closure of the American bases and removal of our country from
NATO.'' Both Greece and Turkey are members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   About 3,500 American military personnel are stationed at four
U.S. bases in Greece, two near Athens and two on the island of
Crete, and a new bases agreement is being negotiated.
   The group calling itself November 17 became known with the
assassination in 1975 of Richard Welch, the CIA station chief in
Athens, and also claimed responsibility for the killing of George
Tsantes, a U.S. Navy captain, in 1983. Police have never arrested
any of its members.
   It name comes from Nov. 17, 1973, when troops and tanks crushed
a student rebellion against the military dictatorship that
controlled Greece from 1967 to 1974.
   Koutsogiorgas, the deputy premier, told reporters Greece plans
tough measures against terrorism, but ``we are behind in matters of
technology. The criminals follow new methods ... and are ahead of
our police in technological know-how.''
   A few Greek policemen have attended anti-terrorism courses run
by British and American experts, but newspapers frequently
criticize the force for inefficiency and old-fashioned methods.
   Nordeen, a native of Minnesota and former Navy pilot, was
assistant naval inspector in Washington before his posting to
Athens. He previously served in the Pacific and at the Jacksonville
Naval Air Base in Florida.

<TEXT>
   Clashes between government troops and
communist guerrillas across the Philippines in the past four days
have killed 13 people, the military reported Wednesday.
   Lt. Col. Anthony Elias, spokesman for the military's Southern
Command, said the bloodiest incident occurred Monday in the town of
Tukuran in Zamboanga del Sur province, about 500 miles south of
Manila on strife-torn Mindanao island.
   Elias said an encounter between soldiers and about 50
heavily-armed communist New People's Army rebels touched off a
two-hour gunbattle that left five soldiers and two government
militiamen dead. There were no casualties on the rebel side.
   In nearby Zamboanga del Norte province, a soldier gunned down
three farmers Sunday after they failed to produce identification
cards at a military checkpoint in the town of Sibutad, according to
the Task Force Detainees, a human rights group.
   Myrna Patangan, spokeswoman for the group, told reporters that
Constabulary Sgt. Leoncio Descalliar stopped five farmers at a
checkpoint and asked them for their residence certificates. When
they failed to produce the ID cards, a soldier with Descalliar
accused them of being members of the New People's Army and began
beating them up. He then opened fire, killing three farmers,
Patangan said. The other two escaped, she added.
   But a police report on the incident said five men, armed with an
M-14 rifle, a .38-caliber revolver and machete knives, were looking
for another soldier at the checkpoint. When confronted, they
attempted to grab Descalliar's gun, prompting his aide to shoot.
   The report said the soldier who shot the farmers turned himself
in to police authorities pending investigation.
   On Zamboanga Peninsula, government troops killed two rebels in
two days of heavy fighting since Sunday, a military report said.
   Lt. Col. Manuel Alajas, an army regional commander, said some 50
heavily armed rebels ambushed an army patrol on the outskirts of
the town of Mutia, about 20 miles southeast of Dipolog, wounding
four soldiers. The guerrillas withdrew, but pursuing troops caught
up with them and killed two rebels. Two more soldiers were wounded,
Alajas said.
   On Panay Island, about 300 miles south of Manila, soldiers shot
and killed a captured rebel Monday, who allegedly was trying to
escape from a military camp in the town of Miag-ao.

<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday approved a $10.8
billion transportation appropriations bill for fiscal 1989 that
boosts spending for the Coast Guard and aviation, and seeks to
shield a Civil War battlefield from development.
   The measure, sent to the Senate on a 371-40 vote, has been
threatened with a veto by administration officials who say it is
too expensive. The bill would pour $2 billion more into
transportation programs for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 than
President Reagan has proposed.
   Besides $10.8 billion in new spending, the legislation would
allow the government to spend up to another $15.4 billion next year
from special funds set aside for aviation, highway and mass transit
projects.
   Overall, the measure would give the Coast Guard a budget of $3.1
billion, of which $492 million would have to be spent on anti-drug
programs. The Federal Aviation Administration would receive $6.6
billion. Both agencies' coffers would be boosted by about 16
percent over 1988 levels.
   The legislation also would make it harder for a developer to
build a proposed shopping mall on a Manassas, Va., site where the
Second Battle of Bull Run was fought in 1862. The provision would
forbid the federal government from allowing highway interchanges to
be built to serve the area.
   The measure also provides $3.3 billion for mass transit
programs, $13.8 billion for highway projects and $590 million for
Amtrak, the passenger railroad. Reagan has repeatedly proposed
ending federal subsidies for Amtrak, and slashing mass transit
assistance virtually in half.
   The legislation, as always, also contains some money for road
construction and other projects that benefit the districts of
particular lawmakers.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $10.6 billion
version of the bill last Friday. The two chambers will have to work
out their differences before the legislation is sent to the White
House.

   A grandfather clock that belonged to
a man believed to have helped organize the Boston Tea Party 215
years ago has been sold for $440,000.
   The silver-dial clock was originally owned by Nathaniel Bradlee,
believed to be one of the 58 organizers of the Dec. 16, 1773, tax
revolt. He had kept at what is now Tremont Street in Boston, where
the tea party was planned.
   The clock was sold by Kennebunkport auctioneer Richard W. Oliver.
   ``It's called the Boston Tea Party clock,'' Oliver said. ``How
much more historical can you get?''
   The successful bidder, Emile Dumont of Hampton Falls, N.H.,
plans to build a wing in his Heritage Inn in Chelmsford, Mass., for
the clock, Oliver said.
   The clock had belonged to a 78-year-old retired stockbroker from
Wiscasset, who said he decided to sell it at Saturday's auction
because he had difficulty insuring it.
   Brewster D. Doggett inherited the clock from his father in 1939.

   No one in this smokestack suburb of
Chicago ever clamored for a poet laureate, so when a rhymster who's
never worked or lived here assumed the title, it ticked off a few
locals.
   They don't want James Underdown and they're not too fond of his
poetry either.
   ``It's kind of cruddy, if you ask me,'' says Mayor Robert
Stefaniak.
   ``For someone to be a poet laureate of a community he should at
least be a resident of the community,'' city librarian Vickie Novak
said Wednesday. ``I've been a lifelong Calumet City resident, and I
don't think he knows the city very well.''
   But Underdown, who recites what he calls Calumet City-inspired
poetry at an off-beat Chicago nightclub, disagreed with Ms. Novak's
assessment.
   ``I've just introduced a new perspective to it (Calumet City)
and she may be blind to what she's been living in her whole life,''
said Underdown, who wears a tuxedo and a black ``Andy Capp'' hat
and smokes a fat ``Black Jack'' cigar while he performs.
   Underdown, who grew up in the affluent suburb of Wheaton, said
only one of his poems is written about Calumet City itself, but
he's written 30 ``from a Calumet City Perspective.''
   He said his favorite line is:
   ``They've said in the past we ain't got no class and we watch TV
all day to see Vanna. But we know it's worse in the back of a
hearse or anywhere in Indiana.''

   It may be a trashy way to win $500 or more, but
Seattle's faithful recyclers probably won't complain.
   The city is launching a ``garbage lottery'' contest to reward
those who turn in bottles, cans, newspapers and other recyclable
goods.
   Lottery applications will be distributed in community
newspapers, grocery stores and other outlets, and once a month city
employees will draw two applications, one each from Seattle's north
and south ends.
   When a name is drawn, utility workers will check the person's
garbage to see if it contains any bottles, cans, newspapers or
other recyclable goods. If none is found, the person gets $500.
Otherwise, the money is added to the next month's garbage jackpot.
   ``It's just like the real lottery,'' said Tim Croll of the
city's Solid Waste Utility. The program should start by early
August.

   Vietnam has approved plans by five ex-Marines to
return to that country to search for U.S. mines that are killing
unsuspecting civilians 20 years after they were planted, an
organizer says.
   ``Innocent people are being killed who weren't even born when
the war was going on,'' said Gene Spanos, now a police lieutenant
in Rosemont. ``We want to go back and show them we have good will.''
   Spanos, 39, said retired Lt. Col. Robert Dalton of Davidsville,
Md., visited Hanoi last week and was told the trip had been
approved by Vietnam's Foreign Ministry.
   Duong Vanh Ngoc and Tranh Dung, members of Vietnam's United
Nations delegation, said they also have learned of Hanoi's approval
but have not received official notice.
   The trip already has received an OK from the U.S. State
Department, said Spanos, who disclosed plans for the visit in
February.
   Spanos said an East Coast businessman, whom he would not
identify, has agreed to finance the mission, estimated to cost
about $30,000. Armed with Marine maps of minefields, the veterans
plan to leave Jan. 8.
   In 1968, Spanos supervised mine-laying as an 18-year-old squad
leader with the 11th Engineers Battalion in the zone between what
was then South Vietnam and North Vietnam.
   In September, while at a reunion of those he served with, Spanos
learned that thousands of Vietnamese have been killed by wandering
into live mines over the past several years.
   ``Four guys were wounded just planting the mines. One kid lost a
foot right in front of me. That's the kind of thing that stays with
you,'' Spanos said Tuesday.
   Joe Bangert, a national director of the Vietnam Veterans of
America, said 56,000 Vietnamese have been killed by exploding
munitions since the war ended in 1975.
   Besides Dalton and Spanos, others going on the trip are: Frank
Noe of Stroughton, Mass.; James Packer of Jamaica Plains, Mass.;
and Nate Genna of Roxbury, Mass.
   Spanos said his group plans to stay in Vietnam for 10 days. They
also hope to visit Hanoi, more than 200 miles north, he said.

   The telephone poll, conducted by The Denver Post and KCNC-TV,
shows Dukakis with the support of 45 percent of the 553 people
randomly surveyed across the state. Bush, the all-but-certain GOP
choice, has the backing of 36 percent of the voters while 19
percent remain uncommitted.
   If the poll results hold up in the general election in November,
it would be an historic state first _ Colorado voters have not
supported a Democratic candidate in 24 years.
   The poll indicates that Colorado's leaning toward the Democratic
candidate comes from a voter desire to change the political party
in power. The poll shows that Dukakis would be favored by about the
same margin even if the Republicans nominated Kansas Sen. Bob Dole,
who is popular among Colorado residents.
   The poll was conducted June 5-7 by Talmey Research & Strategy of
Boulder. It has a margin of error of 4.2 percent.

<HEAD>Canadian Embassy Can Look to Americans for Advice on Spy Flap</HEAD>

   The Canadian Embassy doesn't have to look far for
advice on how to cope with the loss of most of its Soviet employees
in a tit-for-tat spy war: they can ask the Americans across town.
   On Wednesday, Kremlin officials handed the Canadians a list of
25 Soviet employees no longer be allowed to work at the embassy,
said the mission's spokesman, Paul Drager. The Soviets had actually
stopped working Monday.
   American diplomats stationed a few blocks away in downtown
Moscow know the feeling: they lost all 260 of their Soviet support
staff in October 1986.
   The latest pullout comes at a particularly hard time for the
Canadians _ while they are trying to follow developments in the
first Soviet Communist Party conference in 47 years, and just
before Friday's celebration of the Canada Day holiday.
   By tradition, Canada's ambassador is given time on Soviet
television to address the Soviet people on the holiday. It is not
clear whether the spy dispute will affect this tradition.
   The problems began June 22, when Canada announced it was
expelling eight Soviet diplomats and officials for alleged
espionage. Nine other Soviets previously assigned to Canada were
barred from returning. The Soviets retaliated the next day,
expelling two Canadian diplomats and saying three others cannot
come back.
   Canada shot back by kicking out the senior military attache at
the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa and barring a former second secretary
from returning. On Saturday, the Soviets ordered Canada's military
attache to leave Moscow, told seven former diplomats they cannot
return and pulled out the 25 Soviet workers.
   The withdrawal leaves the Canadian Embassy with just 14 Soviet
employees. The hardest-hit section is the one that issues visas for
Soviets traveling to Canada, Drager said. Two of the three Soviets
who worked in the visa section have left, meaning Soviets citizens
will have to wait longer to get permission to visit Canada, Drager
said. The blow comes at a time when Soviets' travel to Canada is
soaring because of new more liberal Soviet regulations, he said.
   The withdrawn employees include carpenters, painters, drivers,
mechanics, translators and maintenance workers. The Canadian
Embassy is trying to replace those workers with spouses and
children of diplomats and of other Canadians living in Moscow, such
as businessmen and journalists.
   The problem is a familiar one for the U.S. Embassy. After the
Soviet Union withdrew its employees, U.S. diplomats had to take
over much of the cooking, cleaning, driving and telephone
answering. They also lost valuable Soviet translators. Eventually,
an American company was hired to send in support staff.
   Like the Americans, the Canadians, who number 42, are adopting a
positive attitude.
   ``We can function and we will function,'' Drager quoted Canadian
Ambassador Vernon Turner as saying.
   Drager, however, said a long-term solution to the staff shortage
has yet to be found. ``It's much too early to say,'' he said.
   The Canadians are hoping the Kremlin will allow some of the
withdrawn Soviets to return or be replaced. On Monday, Canadian
Foreign Minister Joe Clark told reporters in Ottawa after meeting
with Soviet Ambassador Alexei Rodionov that Soviet workers coming
to Montreal to rebuild the fire-damaged Soviet consulate may not
get visas unless the Kremlin reverses its withdrawal of the 25
Soviets.
   Managers of Canadian Embassy programs have given Turner lists of
jobs to be done according to priority, Drager said. Asked if job
assignments of diplomats had been changed because of the staff
shortage, he responded: ``We're doing a lot of different things.
We're certainly coping.''
   Drager refused to say if the diplomats were working longer hours
and declined to say whether the Canadian Embassy had asked the
Americans for advice on how to cope. U.S. Embassy Marguerite Squire
also declined comment.

<TEXT>
   Nine people have been sentenced to life in prison
and 33 people received terms of 10 years or more since China began
a crackdown on panda poachers in August, it was reported Wednesday.
   The state-run People's Daily said authorities in Sichuan, where
most of China's pandas live, handled more than 52 cases of panda
killing, trafficking and smuggling of panda skins since August.
   The report said 133 poachers were arrested in that period, but
did not say how many pandas were killed.
   The giant panda is native only to China, where just under 1,000
live in Sichuan province, in southwestern China, or in neighboring
Tibet.
   The Chinese government has forbidden hunting of the endangered
species, and the courts have repeatedly called for harsh
punishments of people caught killing or selling the animals.
   Previous reports said Hu Fuyin was caught trying to sell the fur
of a baby panda he killed in December 1985 and was sentenced in
December to life in prison.
   Three poachers from Sichuan's Pingwu county were given life
sentences in May for hunting and selling 21 pandas during the past
five years.
   China's panda population has been further threatened by a
shortage in the past five years of the wild bamboo that is its main
food.

<DATELINE>CATAK, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue teams on Wednesday pulled 39 bodies
from the muddy ruins of a coffeehouse that was hit by a landslide
in this mountain village.
   Rescue workers, police officers and soldiers wept openly as the
mud-covered bodies were pulled out and identified one by one over
loudspeakers. Relatives of the victims wailed in mourning.
   Officials said nine of the bodies were not on the list of the
missing. That brought the official death toll from the June 23
disaster to 64.
   Two of the bodies were identified as Birgit Hastenteufel, 25, a
social worker from Bamberg, West Germany, and Andreass Borghard,
28, a pharmacist, also from Bamberg. Another West German tourist
was registered as missing.
   Turkey's two state-run television channels canceled
entertainment programs Wednesday night as a sign of national
mourning for the disaster.
   Grieving villagers watched from a distance as the bodies were
taken from the debris to be transported to the Numune hospital in
Trabzon, about 20 miles away, for identification.
   The landslide dumped half a million tons of dirt and rocks on
the main highway from the Black Sea port of Trabzon to eastern
Turkey and Iran. It also dammed a mountain river flowing through
Catak, causing a flood that covered the debris of the coffeehouse.
   The officials said the three-story building was pushed 30 yards
by the force of the landslide. When the landslide hit, the
coffeehouse was packed with travelers and several villagers
stranded by an earlier rockfall on the highway.
   Rescue operations were slowed by the threat of a new landslide
while 20-foot floodwaters were being drained.

   The nation's drought-plagued upper Midwest
faces warmer than normal temperatures and normal to below-normal
rainfall during July, the National Weather Service reported
Wednesday.
   The 30-day forecast calls for above-normal temperatures
throughout the Midwest as far west as Montana, Colorado and
Wyoming, south through Arkansas and east to the Appalachian
Mountains.
   Below-normal temperatures are expected in the Pacific Northwest
with the remainder of the country expected to be near-normal.
   July rainfall is expected to be below-average for Michigan,
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and most of California.
Above-normal rainfall is expected in portions of Arizona, New
Mexico and in the Puget Sound region. The rest of the country is
likely to have about normal rain for the month.
   The National Weather Service Long Range Predictions Group also
released a 90-day outlook for July, August and September.
   That projection calls for below-normal rainfall in California
and along the Atlantic coast from Washington, D.C., to northern
Florida. Above-normal rainfall is likely in some of the currently
drought-plagued areas, including Montana, Wyoming, southern South
Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico and the western portions of
Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas.
   The rest of the country did not fall into either the above- or
below-normal categories.
   The 90-day temperature outlook is for above-normal readings east
of Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana, with the highest
likelihood of hot weather in the Tennessee Valley and the southern
Appalachians.
   The mountain states were expected to have below-normal readings
during the 90-day period while the rest of the country and New
England could go either way.
   The agency issued a short-range, 6-to-10-day forecast calling
for above-normal temperatures in most of the country except the
southern Atlantic coast and the Puget Sound area. Below-normal
rainfall is expected in the Great Lakes region, Chesapeake Bay
area, Texas and from the mountain states westward to the Pacific.

<HEAD>Intellectuals Question Tito Legacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident intellectuals blame the
late President Tito for most of Yugoslavia's current troubles and
are demanding an end to official veneration of the man who
personified the nation for 35 years.
   The 19-member Committee In Defense of Intellectual Freedoms said
in a statement dated Monday and addressed to the Yugoslav
leadership that Tito built an undemocratic, repressive political
system that ``has thwarted the progressive development of society.''
   A copy was received Wednesday by The Associated Press. It is
believed to be the strongest statement to date for what is called a
``critical reappraisal'' of Tito, the undisputed leader of this
Communist nation from the partisan days of World War II until his
death in 1980 at age 87.
   Tito is still revered by Yugoslav authorities and criticizing
his policies is a criminal offense. The intellectuals described
many instances of public veneration as ``primitive rituals.''
   The group making the statement is led by Dobrica Cosic,
Yugoslavia's most popular author, who was dismissed from the
Communist Party Central Committee in the late 1960s for criticizing
Tito's policies. Its members include university professors,
artists, authors and scientists.
   ``Tito's role in making crucial political decisions and his
absolute power in shaping Yugoslav policies were so great that the
present-day position of the country _ and particularly its current
deep social crisis _ cannot be understood or explained without a
comprehensive and objective scientific and critical reappraisal of
his historical responsibility,'' the statement said.
   ``There can be no way out of the present economic, political and
moral crisis affecting Yugoslav society without a thorough critical
evaluation of past Yugoslav policies.''
   Yugoslavia has a $21 billion foreign debt and an annual
inflation rate of about 170 percent. Growing labor unrest is
threatening the Communist Party's leadership.
   In their statement, the intellectuals traced the crisis to
Tito's last decade in power, when the foreign debt rose from $2
billion to $20 billion.
   They also said he ``intentionally invented political opponents
in order to nurture the ghost of permanent civil war, thus
preventing the meaningful democratization of society.''
   Although Yugoslavia, which left the Soviet bloc in 1948, was
considered the most liberal communist country, Tito was intolerant
of opposition.
   The statement was issued one day before the 40th anniversary of
the day Yugoslavia was formally kicked out of the Soviet bloc after
Tito broke with Josef Stalin. On June 28, 1948, the Informbureau, a
Soviet-dominated grouping of all Communist nations and parties,
voted unanimously to expel Yugoslavia for ``deserting the
principles of Marxism-Leninism.''
   Moscow and its allies, which accounted for more than 80 percent
of Yugoslavia's foreign trade, immediately imposed a trade boycott
and Tito turned to the West.
   According to the intellectuals, a ``dispassionate'' assessment
is needed of Tito's role in measures against dissidents,
particularly those sent to ``one of modern Europe's most sinister
prison camps _ Goli Otok.''
   Goli Otok, or Bare Island, is a rocky island off the central
Adriatic coast that was an internment camp for 13,000 alleged
opponents of the regime after Tito's break with Stalin.
   Several thousand are said to have died because of maltreatment
by prison authorities.
   The intellectuals said Tito's foreign policy ``isolated our
country from its natural cultural, historical, economic and
political surroundings'' in Europe. He was a founder three decades
ago of the organization of nations professing non-alignment.
   That focused his foreign policy on Africa and Asia, the
statement said, instead of on political and economic integration
into Western Europe.
   It also criticized Tito's lavish lifestyle, demanding to know
``the real costs of his rule.''
   Tito's salary was never disclosed, but the statement said the
lengthy court battle over his estate indicated his personal wealth
was substantial.
   His widow, Jovanka, sued the state for title to several
mansions, vineyards, limousines and boats she claimed were his
personal property.

   Patrick Graham wanted to break down the
traditional British reserve and get to know his neighbors a bit
better. So he hung up a sign outside his door.
   ``Unofficial Community Cafe,'' it said. ``Open and Free to All
Local Residents as Long as the Sign is Up.''
   He got more than visitors. He won an award for helping make the
world a better place.
   ``I think you have to be slightly brave to put up a sign saying
`Knock on My Door,' but it could catch on,'' said Nicholas Albery,
founder of an organization called the Institute for Social
Inventions.
   Graham was among 12 people singled out this year by the
institute, a London-based group that annually awards cash prizes to
creative people who think of new ways to improve the quality of
life.
   Graham, a television soundman, hung up his sign when he moved
into his new row house in Cardiff, Wales, last winter. The first
day alone, 13 people dropped by for coffee or tea.
   ``I have a humanist bent and I say all people are worth
something, even the most boring of them. But you have to be ready
to do a lot of listening,'' he said in a telephone interview
Wednesday.
   A young mother up the road even borrowed the sign to host the
homespun cafe for awhile.
   The institute divides its $1,700 cash prize among the winners,
who will be feted at a ceremony on July 12.
   Launched in 1985, the institute publishes a Social Inventions
quarterly for about 400 subscribers, said Albery, 39, a
psychotherapist.
   ``I think there are plenty of ideas that are worthy but dull,
and should be worthy but imaginative,'' he said.
   Similar institutes have formed in Sweden, Denmark and the Soviet
Union, and one is planned for the United States among interested
parties in Philadelphia, San Francisco and Oregon, Albery said.
   He said the Soviet Foundation for Social Inventions has been
swamped with 15,000 ideas from the public since it was set up last
fall by geophysicist Gennady Alferenko.
   Other award winners this year include 65-year-old Ilya
Nikolayevich Savin of the Soviet Union, who proposed a network of
regional and school botanical gardens grown from her own 30-year
stock of fruit and berry plant seeds.
   Also among this year's winners is Margie McGregor, whose
Friendship Trust in Oxfordshire encourages adults to help problem
teen-agers take up hobbies.
   British Biochemist John Hart is cited for a proposal to deal
with juvenile delinquents by postponing their age of majority to
21, thus denying them driving licenses or credit cards.
   The Best Third World Social Invention award went to Dr. Thomas
Lovejoy of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.
   In 1984, he suggested that Western conservation groups could
offer to redeem part of a Third World country's debt in return for
that country providing funds to protect a conservation area, such
as a tropical forest.
   Debt-for-nature swaps have already been arranged in Bolivia,
Ecuador and Costa Rica.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill that would provide grants to states
which enact tough drunken-driving laws won the backing Wednesday of
state highway officials, but was criticized by the Reagan
administration as too inflexible.
   The measure, introduced by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., would
provide grants to states that adopt laws allowing a police officer
to take away a drunken driver's license on the spot and issue a
notice of license suspension or revocation. A judge would make the
final determination.
   ``If we can save 2,000 lives by spending $10 million or $20
million in seed money, is it too much?'' Lautenberg asked. ``What
we're really asking is _ are we willing to invest federal dollars
to help save lives?''
   His bill would tap Highway Trust Fund money for grants to states
to set up alcohol abuse programs. It was endorsed by several state
highway officials during a hearing by the Senate Committee on
Environment and Public Works.
   The panel also is considering a second drunken-driving bill,
introduced by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., that authorizes the
Transportation secretary to actually withhold routine federal
highway funds from states that do not enact the license suspension
and revocation procedures.
   Lautenberg is a co-sponsor of the Reid bill but said at
Wednesday's hearing that he would prefer ``using the carrot first,
then the stick.''
   ``If the incentives aren't enough, let's impose sanctions,'' he
said. ``One way or the other, we want to get to the same goal, and
that is to save lives by getting the drunken driver off the road.''
   But nearly all the witnesses argued that sanctions do not always
work and that they preferred the grant program.
   ``Sanctions, very frankly are counterproductive,'' said Ronald
Fiedler of the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials. ``They decrease funds for other highway
safety programs. We support the incentive approach.''
   George Reagle, associate administrator for traffic safety
programs for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
spoke out against both drunken-driving bills, contending that many
of the provisions in the Lautenberg bill duplicate existing law and
are less flexible.
   Specifically, Reagle complained that the Lautenberg measure
gives states too little time to get the accused drunken drivers to
court. He said that the Reagan administration believes 45 days is a
reasonable requirement, while the Lautenberg bill requires the case
go to a judge within 15 days.
   ``We strongly encourage the states to adopt administrative
systems for license suspensions,'' Reagle told the committee. ``It
is our view, however, that the bill may accomplish little that has
not already been accomplished.''
   By contrast, Norma Phillips, president of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, said her group supports both pieces of legislation.
``Administrative revocation of driver's licenses,'' she said, ``is
MADD's number one legislative priority.''

   Canada's tough new disclosure law on the toxic
contents and health hazards of smoking could set a precedent for a
crackdown on tobacco products in the United States, the nation's
leading anti-smoking campaigner said Wednesday.
   ``What was unthinkable five years ago is now going to be the
subject of serious public debate in the United States,'' said
Garfield Mahood, director of the Toronto-based Non-Smokers' Rights
Association.
   Mahood was jubilant after Parliament gave final approval Tuesday
night to two rigorous anti-smoking bills, despite a major lobbying
effort from the $5.4 billion Canadian tobacco industry.
   ``David has slain Goliath,'' said federal Health Minister Jake
Epp, praising citizens' groups like Mahood's that took on and
defeated the tobacco lobby. ``They were outgunned, they were
outmuscled, and quite frankly they were outfinessed,'' Epp said.
   One bill, introduced by opposition New Democratic Party member
Lynn McDonald, requires the government to provide a smoke-free
environment in all buildings under federal jurisdiction, including
banks. It also must guarantee smoke-free travel on planes, ships,
trains and buses.
   Mindful that 7 million Canadians are smokers _ one adult in
three _ the bill also says employers may set up separately
ventilated smoking areas at their discretion.
   The other bill came from the government and was described by
Mahood as ``the toughest in the world.'' It bans tobacco
advertising in print as of Jan. 1; phases out billboard ads by 1991
and promotion signs by 1993; restricts sponsorship of sports and
cultural events, and prohibits free samples.
   The bill further requires manufacturers to publicly identify all
additives in their products _ Mahood claims these include
turpentine, propane, ammonia and volcanic ash _ and to disclose the
toxic contents of cigarette smoke.
   A leaflet detailing all known health risks from smoking with
replace the general warning now required on cigarette packets.
   ``You might reasonably expect a document the size of the New
York telephone directory,'' Mahood said. He said cigarette smoking
has been linked to 17 terminal diseases causing 35,000 deaths a
year in Canada and 300,000 in the United States.
   ``Americans have always had a strong appreciation for the value
of informed consent,'' said Mahood. ``It will be difficult for (the
tobacco industry) to argue that Americans aren't also entitled to
this information.''
   From the tobacco farms of Ontario to the boardrooms of Imperial
Tobacco, RJR-Macdonald and Rothmans in Toronto and Montreal,
industry leaders huddled in meetings Wednesday to discuss how to
protect their livelihood. The volume of cigarette sales in Canada
has slumped 22 percent in the past five years.
   Spokesmen said the legislation may be challenged in court on the
grounds that the advertising ban violates a constitutional
guarantee of free speech. They complained that while tobacco
remains a legal product, it will soon be illegal to talk about it
commercially.
   ``Whether the challenge comes from a magazine editor, an outdoor
advertising firm, a retail chain, a manufacturer or all the above
is hard to say right now,'' said Jacques Lariviere, spokesman for
the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council. The industry employs
60,000 Canadians.
   Lariviere said the disclosure of cigarette additives involves
proprietary rights ``like the recipe for Coca-Cola,'' and he
worried that the new laws ``could provide impetus to those south of
the border who wish to remove the tobacco industry from the face of
the earth.''
   Michel Bedard, president of the industry-supported Smokers'
Freedom Society, guessed that smokers will ignore the new
health-hazard warnings.
   ``You get the list of contents on a box of corn flakes but
nobody really pays attention to it,'' said Bedard.
   As for the ad ban, he noted that 140 million times a day someone
in Canada lights a cigarette, ``and that's an advertisement in
itself.''
   The ban could actually hurt the public if a safer filter is
developed but manufacturers are unable to tell anyone about it, he
said.

<TEXT>
   The partially deaf boy whose
identity puzzled authorities for months until his mother arrived to
claim him was just one of hundreds of waifs who fill the streets of
this border city.
   And more and more of these young beggars are finding their way
across the Rio Grande into El Paso, Texas, where law enforcement
officials discussed the issue at Tuesday's City Council meeting.
   Sometimes authorities in Juarez take the street urchins to the
Integrated Family Development center, the federal child-welfare
agency, for medical care and education.
   That's what happened to Jose de Jesus Garcia Aguilera, who was
known as Sabath before he was reunited Tuesday with his mother
after eight months apart.
   But hundreds of other Mexican children remain abused or
abandoned, and little can be done because there is not enough money
in the financially strapped country, said Olivia Espinosa Bermudez,
director of the Integrated Family Development office in Juarez.
   The agency, known by its Spanish acronym as DIF, can take care
of about 80 children at its shelter in central Juarez, Mrs.
Bermudez said Wednesday. It's filled nearly to capacity.
   ``I know there are more, but we cannot afford to pay the
necessary attention to them,'' she said. ``We just cannot handle
more than that.''
   DIF tries to find children's parents, and in cases where they
are unfit, it tries to find foster parents. It also runs a school,
provides medical care, and encourages the older children to enroll
in technical school.
   Downtown Juarez and the international bridges are full of young
panhandlers, some barely old enough to walk. Older children
sometimes play in pathetic makeshift brass bands to attract donors'
attention; teen-agers with squeegees wash windshields for pocket
change.
   Some adult beggars rent children for $1 a day to elicit more
sympathy from passers-by, deputy Border Patrol chief Gus de la Vina
told the El Paso council meeting.
   El Paso Police Chief John Scagno told the council that his
officers rounded up 27 beggars on Saturday. He said all of them
were from Mexico and all were back on El Paso's streets the next
day.
   Mrs. Bermudez said some of the youngsters picked up are runaways
who don't want to go home.
   That's apparently not the case with 9-yar-old Jesus, whose
mother, Micaela Aguilera de Garcia of the Gulf Coast port of
Tampico, arrived Tuesday in Juarez to claim her boy. Jesus,
nicknamed Chuy, seemed eager to go home.
   Chuy ran away last October and was picked up Nov. 7 near
downtown Juarez. For months, authorities on both sides of the
border tried to find out the boy's identity and origins. The task
was frustrating because Chuy can speak only a few words and
communicates mostly through gestures and pictures.
   No one knows why Chuy chose to run away to Juarez, but many
people emigrate to the city of 1.1 million because of the relative
wealth of northern Mexico and the lure of jobs in the United
States, Mrs. Bermudez said.
   She said DIF and the Texas Department of Human Services signed a
pact last February in which each side pledged to help the other in
cases where parents and children become separated across the border.
   DIF officials plan to visit the home of Ms. Aguilera, where she
lives in a one-room house with her mother and four other children,
Mrs. Bermudez said. Then they will report about the conditions to
their superiors in Ciudad Victoria, capital of Tamaulipas state.
Chuy might attend a DIF-run school in Victoria, where he could
learn to speak and use sign language, she said.

   The Transportation Department broadened its
proposed drug testing requirements Wednesday to include more than
350,000 workers in the mass transit, merchant marine and pipeline
industries.
   The action follows earlier announcements of proposed regulations
that would require a variety of drug tests for workers in
safety-related jobs in aviation, interstate bus and trucking, and
the railroads.
   None of the regulations has been put into effect, and some
already are under court challenge.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said the testing
requirements for mass transit workers, merchant seamen and
employees of companies that transport natural gas or hazardous
liquids through pipelines comports with his goal of discouraging
drug abuse in all sectors.
   ``It is crucial that we send a `zero tolerance' message to all
segments of our population regarding drug abuse _ the
transportation industry included,'' Burnley said in a statement.
   The new proposed regulation, as the previous ones involving
aviation, trucking and the railroads, calls for a variety of drug
tests, including random tests for employees involved in
safety-related jobs.
   The Transportation Department estimates about 108,000 workers,
including vehicle operators and maintenance workers, would be
subject to the requirements covering mass transit systems such as
city bus and subway lines.
   Another 132,000 seamen on commercial vessels and an estimated
116,500 employees of companies that operate pipeline facilities for
natural gas and hazardous liquids would be covered by the
regulation, the department said.
   Under the proposed rule, the U.S. Coast Guard would require the
owners of commercial ships to conduct the testing program. If the
tests are not required, the Coast Guard could lift the marine
operator's license, the department said.
   Pipeline operators, who also could lose their license, also
would be responsible for testing their employees under the
regulation.
   Local transit officials could lose federal transit subsidies
under the regulation unless they conduct the required testing
programs.

<HEAD>Dukakis Wins First Formal Union Endorsement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democractic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis got his first formal union endorsement on Wednesday from a
group that represents mostly federal Internal Revenue Service and
Customs Service workers.
   The 59,000-member National Treasury Employees Union said its
endorsement of the certain Democratic nominee was based on his
commitment to beef up support for the Customs Service's drug
interdiction programs and revenue agencies such as the IRS as a way
to reduce the federal deficit.
   ``The Reagan administration has been long on empty words and
false perceptions but very, very short on good deeds,'' said the
union's president, Robert Tobias.
   ``It proposed reductions of funds to support Customs Service
drug interdiction by 23 percent and whacked drug education
expenditures by 36 percent,'' Tobia said.
   ``The Reagan-Bush romance with Noriega was the capper,'' he
said, referring to Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, who was
indicted by a federal grand jury in Florida on drug smuggling
charges.
   Tobias also praised what he called Dukakis' commitment to
collective bargaining as evidenced by his relations with
Massachusetts state employees over the past decade.
   The only other union to formally endorse a presidential
candidate so far is the 23,000-member, black-dominated National
Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees. It endorsed civil
rights leader Jesse Jackson early in the primary campaign.
   The Treasury Employees and Hospital Employees unions are not
affiliated with the 14-million member AFL-CIO, which has put off a
formal endorsement until after the Republican National Convention
in August.

<TEXT>
   A six-block area in a middle-class
neighborhood is off limits after 10 p.m. to children under 16 as
the city tries to keep young people away from drug dealers and
other criminals.
   Police Chief Tommy Moffett said the area is ``a No. 1 hangout
for drug users and peddlers of stolen property. We have seen some
gang activity. And juveniles are being recruited by drug pushers.
   ``We need to separate the youths from that element,'' he said.
   Officials said the emergency 10 p.m. curfew, approved
unanimously by City Council on Tuesday, will continue until Sept.
30. For the rest of Biloxi, a southern Missippi city of 49,000
people on the Gulf of Mexico, the curfew for those under 16 is 1
a.m. to 5 a.m.
   The curfew area is a well-kept neighborhood of modest homes with
several nightclubs and a park. Officials said street corners, open
lots and parking lots have become gathering places for criminals
who hide in the crowds of young people at night.
   The police chief said young people idolize the criminals and
drug pushers in the area, and they have helped criminals escape
from police. Officers are less aggressive because of the presence
of young people, he said.
   Officials said it will be easier for police to fight the city's
drug and crime problems with the youths off the street.
   City Councilman William Stallworth said he proposed the curfew
after pleas from residents. Without juvenile ``shields,'' criminals
will be forced out of the neighborhood, he said.
   ``If you can break up the hub, then everything disperses,'' he
said. ``The situation has become critical.''
   Over the last 18 months in the curfew area, officials said there
have been four homicides, 10 shootings and 246 assaults, including
three assaults on police officers. More than a third of the city's
juvenile problems were reported from that area during the same
period.

   The Supreme Court decision upholding the
validity of independent counsels clears the way for the sentencing
of former White House aide Michael K. Deaver for lying under oath
about his lobbying business.
   The trial judge in Deaver's case had stayed further proceedings
in the case after a federal appellate court in Washington struck
down the constitutionality of the independent counsel law last
January.
   But the Supreme Court's decision Wednesday removes an important
element of Deaver's challenge to his prosecution, though his
lawyers say they have other issues to raise when they appeal the
conviction.
   The decision also means that former White House political
director Lyn Nofziger will have to rely on other issues to appeal
his conviction and 90-day sentence for illegally lobbying former
Reagan administration colleagues.
   And the decision dispels any doubt about the legal authority of
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to prosecute former White
House aide Oliver L. North and other defendants on charges stemming
from the Iran-Contra arms and money affair.
   ``The independent counsel statute provides a workable solution
to a difficult problem,'' Walsh, who had accepted a back-up
appointment, said in a statement. ``We are gratified that the
Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of that statute.''
   The prosecutor in Deaver's case, independent counsel Whitney
North Seymour, said in a brief statement Wednesday that he would
ask U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to reschedule the
sentencing ``at an early date, so the Deaver case can then move on
through the appeal to its final conclusion.''
   Seymour, who declined to accept a parallel appointment from the
Justice Department to blunt the effect of contitutional challenges
to the statute, called the high court's decision ``a major victory
for the public interest.''
   Deaver could receive a five-year sentence for each of three
felony convictions of lying to a grand jury and the House Energy
and Commerce investigations subcommittee about the lobbying
business he formed after leaving President Reagan's staff in 1985.
   Deaver was found guilty of lying when he denied or said he
couldn't recall lobbying former administration colleagues on behalf
of private clients.
   When questions about the propriety of his lobbying business were
raised in 1986, Deaver requested the appointment of an independent
counsel to investigate the allegations in the hopes of clearing his
name.
   His lawyers later tried to stop his indictment on the perjury
charges by challenging Seymour's constitutional and legal authority
to prosecute the case.
   Randall J. Turk, one of Deaver's lawyers, said the conviction
could have been overturned had the law been struck down. But he
said the defense still had other avenues to pursue.
   ``We have a number of issues still pending before the trial
court and if we don't prevail there, we plan to pursue an appeal,''
Turk said.
   Deaver's lawyers have asked Jackson to set aside the verdict on
the ground that the judge made improper rulings and gave erroneous
jury instructions.
   E. Lawrence Barcella, who defended Nofziger, also contended that
the independent counsel decision is not a big setback for his
client.
   ``While we don't agree with the opinion, it doesn't
significantly affect our challenge to the charges that were lodged
against Mr. Nofziger,'' Barcella said.
   ``Our challenge has always been focused on the post-employement
sections of the Ethics in Government Act, the vagueness of that
statute and the application of the facts to that statute,''
Barcella said.
   Nofziger was convicted earlier this year of three counts of
violating the law by lobbying former Reagan administration
colleagues, including then-White House counselor Edwin Meese III,
within a year of leaving the president's staff.
   He has been allowed to remain free pending appeal to the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, which is scheduled to hear
arguments in November.
   Had the high court struck down the statute, however, Nofziger's
conviction might have been put in jeopardy. Some of the evidence
independent counsel James C. McKay used to convict Nofziger was
obtained before McKay accepted a dual appointment from the Justice
Department last year.
   McKay, meanwhile, is investigating Meese to determine whether he
used his government office for financial gain.
   The high court's ruling also revives the long dormant
investigation of independent counsel Alexia Morrison to investigate
allegations that former Assistant Attorney General Theodore B.
Olson obstructed a congressional investigation of the ``Superfund''
scandal at the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Olson and two other former high-ranking Justice Department
officials had challenged Morrison's power to subpoena them. Their
efforts to resist the subpoenas led to the Supreme Court ruling
Wednesday.
   ``Obviously we are very pleased with the opinion and
particularly at the fact that it was reached nearly unanimously by
the court,'' Morrison said.

   Delegates to a national Communist Party conference
split openly Wednesday over the pace of economic change and the
media's new independence under Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   They also ordered an investigation into a report that some of
the delegates in attendance have taken bribes.
   Gorbachev broke in at one point to denounce attempts by any
``one group of people'' to monopolize the nation's press, as other
delegates lashed out at publications including Ogonyok magazine,
which has been one of the most daring advocates of the Kremlin's
campaign for ``glasnost,'' or openness.
   The 5,000 delegates to the party's first national conference in
47 years watched a rare spectacle in this long-closed society:
speakers at an official gathering daring to disagree.
   Although closed to all but the official media, Soviet television
viewers and newspaper readers got a taste of the proceedings from
various published and broadcast reports on the second day of the
open-ended forum.
   Gorbachev opened the conference in the Kremlin on Tuesday
proposing to revamp the Soviet political system by indirect
election of a more powerful president, convening of a full-time
legislature, and shifting authority from local Communist Party
bureaucracies to local government councils. He also pressed for a
quick return to family farming to spur food production and end
chronic shortages.
   Delegates themselves and published or broadcast reports
Wednesday indicated the conference's second day was marked by
contradictory assessments of the fruits of Gorbachev's drive for
``perestroika'' or social and economic restructuring.
   ``I can't really make a resume yet about what's for real and
what's not,'' said Daniel Granin, a Soviet author and conference
delegate from Leningrad. ``So far, it's a real muddle ... it's a
complete mess.''
   The press became a target, with critics suggesting there has
been too much openness.
   Gorbachev, who was sitting on the dais in the Kremlin hall,
interrupted Mikhail Ulyanov to add his thoughts to those of the
head of the Russian federation's theater workers union, who
observed the Soviet media are no longer servile, but a force to be
reckoned with.
   In the past, Gorbachev said, ``there was a monopoly on the mass
media by one group of people, and we know what this has brought
about. Now we see another group, acting very gradually, wants to
use the press as a national rostrum. We want the pluralism of views
.... therefore, it is necessary to create conditions for the
expression of various viewpoints.''
   His comments drew stormy applause in the giant hall, and Yuri A.
Sklyarov of the party's Central Committee Propaganda Department
said other delegates had criticized Ogonyok and its editor,
conference delegate Vitaly Korotich, as well as other contemorary
Soviet journals exploring the frontiers of glasnost.
   F.V. Popov, party chief in the Siberian Altai region, called his
fellow delegates' attention to the latest issue of Ogonyok, which
accused some Uzbek delegates of involvement in corruption.
   In an article detailing an investigation of widespread
corruption in the Asian republic, Ogonyok said several
``bribetakers'' had been elected to represent Uzbekhistan at the
conference.
   ``There's nothing about it in the report of the credentials
committee, but it's in Korotich's Ogonyok,'' Popov said of the
corruption reports. The credentials committee certified all the
delegates elected to the conference.
   Popov's remarks were televised during the evening news program
``Vremya.''
   Popov demanded an investigation into the accusation, and
Korotich said Gorbachev directed that a inquiry begin Thursday.
Uzbek party boss Rafik N. Nishanov, who spoke at a news conference,
said a decision from the credentials commission was expected by
Thursday.
   Vladimir Karpov, head of the Writers Union, complained that some
writers are depicting Soviet history ``totally in black,'' an
apparent reference to recent publication of a barrage of exposes
criticizing the late dictator Josef Stalin and other former Soviet
leaders.
   Karpov's deputy, Yuri Bondarev, charged that nihilistic
criticism was becoming a commanding force in the press.
   ``The immorality of the press cannot teach morality,'' he said.
   Delegate Grigory Baklanov, chief editor of the literary magazine
Znamya, told a late evening news conference he regarded the
comments by the two Writers Union leaders a disgrace.
   ``I felt shame for them as a writer,'' Baklanov said. ``I don't
think their speeches were proper. It was a disgrace, and if I'm
given the floor, I'll certainly say what I think.''
   On Tuesday, Leonid Abalkin, head of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences' Economics Institute and a top adviser to Gorbachev, told
the conference the Soviet economy is not making headway because it
still measures its progress by the number of items it produces
rather than their quality.
   But Georgy Arbatov, head of the Institute of the U.S.A. and
Canada and a member of the policy-making Central Committee, said he
``totally disagreed'' with Abalkin and that the Soviet Union had
made great progress in ``creating the political, spiritual and
moral preconditions for the economic reform.''
   Y.A. Smirnov, the manager of a chemical factory in the Ural
Mountain city of Nizhnitagilsk, complained that he so far had heard
nothing that would help him improve the work of his factory.
   Addressing Abalkin in an interview on Soviet TV, Smirnov said:
``You are the economic institute, you should map this strategy.
Abalkin said it's necessary, but did say how to do it.''
   On Tuesday, delegates adopted a rule making speakers hew to the
conference's agenda after an official from the Moscow party, V.
Belyaninov, was hounded from the stage by delegates' derisive
clapping. The news agency Tass said the rule prevents delegates
from wasting time by reporting on their own activities or
congratulating the chamber for its conduct of the debate.

<HEAD>Takeshita Puts His Job On Line For Tax Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has decided to push
for tax reform, putting his 8-month-old job on the line on an issue
that his two predecessors were unable to tackle.
   The plan already has drawn substantial opposition. In an unusual
display of protest, some Japanese motorists have pasted bumper
stickers on their cars that say ``We oppose the value-added tax.''
   An editorial in the nationwide newspaper Asahi Shimbun urged
Takeshita to submit the plan to a national referendum and ``should
such efforts fail, then the obvious step would be to dissolve the
Lower House and call a general election.''
   Previous attempts at tax reform have met with little success.
The late Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira unsuccessfully tried to
introduce a general excise tax in 1979 and failed.
   Takeshita's predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone, tried to push a 5
percent sales tax through the legislature last year and suffered an
embarrassing setback when he had to withdraw it.
   Later, in local elections, Nakasone's governing Liberal
Democratic Party suffered severe losses over the sales tax issue.
   The general feeling is that Takeshita's political career is
riding on the outcome of his tax plan.
   ``Prime Minister Takeshita said ... that he will put his
political life on this,'' said a Foreign Ministry spokesman who
demanded anonymity. ``This could be rather dangerous.''
   The Diet, or Japanese parliament, has agreed to return from its
summer recess to take up the issue in an extraordinary 120-day
session beginning July 11.
   In a statement to the nation, Takeshita said Tuesday that ``the
current tax system relies too heavily on direct taxes, especially
taxes derived from salary increases. As a result, as you already
know, there has been a growing sentiment among salaried workers
that the tax system is too heavy and unfair.''
   Some Japanese oppose the current system because it relies almost
entirely on direct taxes and provides substantial tax breaks for
certain groups, such as politicians and doctors.
   As Japanese incomes have risen, so has their tax burden, to the
point where many Japanese have resorted to tax evasion.
   The National Tax Agency reported on June 23 that tax evasion had
reached a record high. The agency said it uncovered unreported
revenues totaling $518 million in fiscal 1987, up $29 million over
the previous record set in 1985.
   However, critics say Takeshita's plan is flawed, and leaves too
many loopholes without providing enough relief to middle-income
families.
   According to a study by the Shimouma Consumers' Cooperative
Association, a Tokyo consumers group, the new tax plan means that a
typical four-member household with an annual income of $50,750
would save less than $775 a year under the Liberal Democratic
Party's tax reform.
   The association said the typical family would pay $1,250 less in
income and property taxes, but a new 3 percent sales tax would cost
an additional $475.
   Small businesses oppose the plan, saying there is no guarantee
they can pass on increased costs to consumers. Consumers have
objected, saying there is no guarantee prices won't rise
substantially.
   Takeshita's plan calls for reducing the current 12 tax brackets,
with tax rates ranging from 10.5 percent to 60 percent, to five
brackets with rates ranging from 10 to 50 percent. Property taxes
also would be reduced.
   Although tax revenues would drop at first, they are expected to
rise as the economy continues to expand, boosted in part by
Takeshita's pledge to turn Japan away from its export-driven
economy and increase domestic demand.

   Activists on the left and the right vied for
the pre-convention spotlight Wednesday, warning the Democrats and
likely Republican presidential nominee George Bush not to take them
for granted.
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell contended Bush's advisers are pressing
him to refrain from mentioning controversial issues such as
reproductive rights and homosexuality.
   At the other end of the political spectrum, representatives from
the National Organization for Women and the Fund for a Feminist
Majority said the Democrats should not assume the ``gender gap''
frees them of responsibility in promoting women's causes and female
candidates.
   Falwell called homosexuality a ``perverted lifestyle,'' and when
asked if he would urge Bush to make the same statement, he said,
``I would recommend that everyone tell the truth, and that's what
it is; it's a perverted lifestyle.''
   The TV evangelist joined other conservatives in announcing
``Family Forum 88'' to be held before both the Democratic and
Republican national conventions this summer.
   Meanwhile, feminists and People for the American Way announced
opposing convention plans to highlight liberal views.
   Falwell, himself a strong Bush supporter, said, ``It is
important for George Bush to pick up the mantle'' of support for
conservative social issues that endeared President Reagan to the
right. But he said a vanguard of experts and advisers is ``trying
to keep George Bush from doing what he needs to do.''
   He said the Bush campaign cannot rest assured that the religious
right ``will have nowhere else to go'' other than the Republican
ticket.
   ``We can go fishing,'' he told a news conference. ``If they're
not enthusiastic, they don't vote,'' he said of religious
conservatives.
   Falwell said he is confident Bush is committed to the agenda of
conservative family issues that helped elect Reagan but added,``He
needs to be saying that openly and often.''
   Falwell said that in talking to evangelical leaders he has
sensed ``a deep and unanimous concern that the Republican Party
this time is offering little more than the Democratic Party.''
   Eleanor Smeal of the Fund for a Feminist Majority and NOW
president Molly Yard saved most of their fire for the Republicans,
whose platform hearings Smeal will address this week.
   Smeal said the gender gap, in which polls show women voting more
Democratic in the Reagan years and providing the margin of victory
in some congressional races, is becoming ``a gender gulf.''
   Still, despite the GOP's comparative ``backwardness'' in issues
such as comparable worth, Equal Rights Amendment, reproductive
choice, employment equity and party decision-making, said Yard,
``It's perfectly possible for the Democrats ... to throw away their
advantage. We will do our bst to make both parties realize that the
gender gap is there to be used.''
   Meanwhile, People for the American Way, a liberal lobby group
founded by TV producer Norman Lear, plans to be on hand at both the
Republican and Democratic conventions this summer to counter the
efforts of the right to influence the parties, said the group's
president, Arthur Kropp.
   He said Falwell and the other Family Forum sponsors, including
Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America and Paul Weyrich of
the Free Congress Foundation, were using a family-issues screen to
promote their real positions against civil rights, women's rights,
and gay rights and for such foreign policy items as the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   Weyrich said both political parties were reluctant to publicly
support the conservative social agenda, saying, ``The party leaders
hate controversial issues.''

   A court Wednesday sentenced six students
convicted in the slaying of a classmate that triggered campus
riots, a newspaper reported. One of the students was sentenced to
death.
   On June 1, a group of students attacked several of their Beijing
University classmates outside an off-campus food store and killed
Chai Qingfeng, 22. Chai, who was shot in the head with BB gun
pellets and beaten with a shovel, died the following day.
   The court ordered the death penalty for Wang Jian, 26,
identified as the gang leader who shot Chai. Wang, unemployed and
with a record of theft, was convicted of deliberate manslaughter
and hooliganism, the Beijing Evening News said.
   In China, executions usually are carried out with a gunshot to
the back of the head.
   Ha Enming, 18, also unemployed and with a theft record, was
convicted of deliberate manslaughter and given a suspended death
sentence, which is to be reevaluated at the end of two years of
reform labor. The official Xinhua News Agency reported that Ha had
started the brawl and hit Chai with an iron shovel.
   Wang Jianming, 21, and Wang Yonglian, 19, who injured two other
students, were convicted of hooliganism and sentenced to 15 and
seven years in prison, respectively.
   Wang Li, 22, was convicted of sheltering a criminal and
hooliganism, and sentenced to three years in prison. The agency
reported she encouraged her friends to beat the students, gave
false testimony to police, and helped the other five flee by giving
them money.
   The agency reported that Liu Bin, 22, was not punished because
he had tried to stop his classmates from attacking their fellow
students.
   The reports did not say if any of the sentenced students named
Wang _ a common name in China _ are related.
   On the night of Chai's death, nearly 1,000 fellow students
marched from the campus to central Beijing's Tiananmen Square to
demonstrate their sorrow and demand tighter security for students.
   Within the next week, hundreds of posters were posted at the
university, denouncing government corruption and demanding
democracy and more funds for education. The unrest subsided after
police sealed off Tiananmen Square.
   In an effort to calm the students, police arrested the six
suspects within 48 hours of Chai's death. The trial of the six
began June 18 and was closed to the foreign media. No official
reports were available on the testimony.
   Chai was the second university student murdered in Beijing in
the past year. A student at the University of Foreign Economic
Relations was killed in December in a fight with two local youths.
They also were arrested and tried, and one was executed.

<HEAD>House Passes Final Appropriations Bill Earlier Than Usual</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed the last of its 13 annual
appropriations bills on Wednesday, the earliest that feat has been
accomplished in 28 years.
   ``Hell has indeed frozen over,'' quipped Rep. Silvio Conte of
Massachusetts, senior Republican on the House Appropriations
Committee.
   After the House overwhelmingly approved its last two money bills
_ covering transportation and interior programs _ House Speaker Jim
Wright halted deliberations to hail ``a historically significant
occasion.''
   The last time the House approved all of its spending bills
before June 30 was in 1960, when the new fiscal year began July 1.
This year's bills are for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   This year's process has been immensely easier than in recent
years because of last fall's deficit-reduction agreement between
President Reagan and congressional leaders. That pact decided in
advance next year's overall spending levels for military, foreign
aid, and domestic agency programs.
   ``We have kept the total of appropriations bills below the
president's requests, although we made rearrangements of priorities
of the various bills to continue essential domestic programs,''
said Rep. Jamie L. Whitten, D-Miss., the chairman of the
Appropriations Committee who received a round of applause.
   Because of the House's changes in spending plans, some of which
the White House contends are too costly, there are veto threats
hanging over several of the bills.
   But even if just one of the regular spending bills is eventually
signed by the president, the record will be better than in the last
two years.
   For last year and the current fiscal year, all of the
government's spending authority has been wrapped into huge,
catchall money bills. The president has promised never again to
sign one of those omnibus measures, and many in Congress vowed
never to vote for one again.
   The Senate has approved its version of four spending bills. The
House and Senate have reached agreement on one of those, and it
could be sent to the White House in the next few days.

   Scores of amateur baseball players flocked to a
city park Wednesday to try out for a major league team that will
compete only on the silver screen.
   But some of the men who showed up wearing baseball caps and
lugging bats and gloves hoped that, even if they didn't catch the
eye of the casting director, they might be noticed by the
professional scouts who were on hand.
   ``If there's some major league prospects out there, you can bet
your pants I'll be there to sign them,'' said scout Emil Belich, of
the Major League Baseball Scouting Bureau. ``You never know.''
   The movie, titled ``Major League,'' will be filmed in Milwaukee
later this summer.
   ``It's been a dream of mine to be in the movies and to play
ball. I get on this (cast) and it's a dream come true,'' said Dan
Steffan of Milwaukee, one of the nearly 200 men who turned up at
the daylong tryouts at Washington Park.
   ``I can hit, I can pitch and I can do anything they want to....
It just depends on what they're looking for,'' added William Pucci,
24, of suburban Brookfield, who plays semi-professional baseball in
the Milwaukee area.
   Dan Barrett, a Marquette University student from Cincinnati,
said he would be willing to sacrifice his college soccer season to
make the movie.
   ``I'd love to make a summer of it. I'd maybe even bypass the
soccer season if it help me'' get on the squad, Barrett said.
   The movie, produced by Major League Productions, will focus on a
professional team from Cleveland that sheds its losing ways during
a championship season, said Lisa Beasly, head of the casting crew.
   The filming of ``Major League'' comes on the heels of the
release this summer of a baseball romance story, ``Bull Durham''
about a minor league catcher. ``Major League'' is expected to be
released next spring.
   Most of the movies will be filmed between the end of July and
mid-September at Milwaukee's County Stadium, home of the Milwaukee
Brewers professional baseball team.
   ``It's a great city and everybody's wonderful and they've got
that wonderful ball park,'' Beasly said.
   Other scenes will be shot in Tucson, Ariz., and Mexico, Beasly
said.
   Beasly and her assistants said about 50 men will be selected to
play on the teams featured in the movie. Five will travel with the
regular cast, which includes Charlie Sheen as the team's star
pitcher and Tom Berenger as a catcher.
   ``They have to look like major league ball players,'' Beasly
said. ``If nothing else, they get to wear the major league uniforms
of their dreams.''
   To help with the tryouts, Beasly asked former Cleveland Indians
great Ken Keltner to come to the field. Keltner's diving catch at
third base helped snap Hall of Famer Joe Dimaggio's 56-game hitting
streak in 1941.
   ``That's my alma mater (Cleveland) and this is my home town,
Milwaukee, so I guess I had to be here,'' he said.

   Patrick J. Kennedy, the 20-year-old son
of Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, said Wednesday he will run
for office, challenging a long-time legislator in Rhode Island,
where he attends college.
   Kennedy will face five-term state Rep. John M. Skeffington Jr.
in the Sept. 14 primary. The winner is virtually assured of
election in the heavily Democratic district.
   ``I think I offer new ideas and especially important, the energy
to put those ideas to work,'' Kennedy said, appearing slightly
nervous before the television cameras as he filed his candidacy
papers.
   Skeffington said he was surprised that a Kennedy would decide to
begin his political career by challenging a member of his own party.
   ``I did not think they would come in running against an
incumbent Democrat holding office,'' Skeffington said. ``I don't
think they've ever done that before, with the exception of (Patrick
Kennedy's) father running for president.''
   Skeffington, in an interview, stressed his family's ties to the
working- to middle-class Mount Pleasant neighborhood where his
grandfather established the family funeral home 75 years ago.
   ``I'm 50 years old. My roots are here. I'm not going anywhere,''
he said. Under Rhode Island law, anyone who is 18 and has lived in
the state for 30 days may run for the General Assembly.
   Kennedy, who will be a junior at Providence College this fall,
said he plans to make the state his home after graduation. ``My
community is Mount Pleasant and my future is Rhode Island,'' he
said.
   In 1986, Skeffington won renomination by just 165 votes over
Brian Reddy, a political newcomer.
   Kennedy's name has appeared on a Rhode Island ballot once
before. In the March presidential primary he spent $12,000 and won
more votes than any other delegate for Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis in the state's 2nd Congressional District except for
Providence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr.
   ``Because of the money he can put into this race, it will be an
interesting contest,'' Skeffington said. ``I've never hired a
polling association before, but I've been forced to this year.''
   Kennedy said he had not drawn up a budget yet, but does not plan
to spend any more than ``you would spend in any hotly contested
legislative race.''
   Kennedy is the youngest of Edward Kennedy's three children. Two
of his cousins, both children of the late Robert F. Kennedy, have
also run for office. Joseph P. Kennedy II was elected to Congress
from Massachusetts and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend lost a
congressional race in Maryland.

<HEAD>Government Annouces Proposals to Liberalize Secrecy Laws</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Raises 6th graf to 3rd graf to raise reference to opposition

   The government announced proposals Wednesday to
liberalize Britain's sweeping secrecy laws by decriminalizing
trivial leaks and giving journalists more legal protection.
   Another key clause would confine secrecy mainly to defense,
intelligence and foreign affairs.
   The opposition Labor Party denounced the proposals as
``draconian and unacceptable.'' They also were criticized by
proponents of freedom of information, and by at least one Tory
legislator.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said the Conservative government,
long accused of being obsessed with secrecy, aimed to ``clip the
wings of any possible abuse of the criminal law by the Executive.''
   ``This should dispel any notion that the criminal law is being
used to protect information simply because its disclosure would
embarrass the government,'' Hurd told the House of Commons.
   However, the reforms would reinforce the lifetime gag on
intelligence agents and make them automatically liable for criminal
prosecution for any disclosure.
   Hurd said the move was the most radical plan yet to reform the
Official Secrets Act, which makes it a criminal offense to reveal
any official information, however trivial, without formal
authorization.
   The act, passed hastily during a 1911 German spy scare, has
helped give Britain a reputation as the most secretive of the
Western democracies.
   The new proposals restricted secrecy to six categories: defense;
security and intelligence; international relations; information
obtained in confidence from other governments; information useful
to criminals; and information about bugging, telephone surveilance
and the reading of mail.
   However, officials would face internal disciplinary measures for
disclosing confidential material such as Cabinet documents.
   ``From a freedom of information point of view, this is dismal,''
said Des Wilson, chairman of the Campaign for Freedom of
Information pressure group.
   ``This gives no greater access to information. It simply narrows
the number of categories in which disclosure is a criminal
offense.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has ruled out a U.S.-style
Freedom of Information Act.
   The proposals, outlined in a policy document presented to
Parliament, followed a series of secrecy-related controversies.
   These included a 1986 police raid on British Broadcasting Corp.
studios to seize tapes of a documentary about a spy satellite, and
the government's losing two-year court battle to ban publication of
``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of retired intelligence officer Peter
Wright.
   Under the new proposals, Wright, who lives in Australia, could
be pursued with the same vigor and be charged if he returned to
Britain.
   The proposals also stipulated that people charged under the
Official Secrets Act cannot plead in their defense that the leak
was in the public interest, commonly known as whistle-blowing, or
that the material had been already published elsewhere.
   In 1985, a jury acquitted Clive Ponting, a former senior civil
servant, on grounds that his exposure of a goverment cover-up of
facts surrounding the sinking of an Argentine cruiser in the 1982
Falkland Islands war was in the public interest.
   ``I would probably have been found guilty under these new
proposals,'' Ponting commented Wednesday.
   However, the proposals offer journalists a new protection by
shifting to the prosecution the onus of proving that a disclosure
gravely harmed national interests.
   Courts alone, and not government ministers, would be able to
rule on what is secret.
   Richard Shepherd, a Tory legislator whose more liberal reform
bill was defeated last January on Mrs. Thatcher's instructions,
called the government proposals ``repressive.''
   But analysts said a parliamentary revolt by Tory dissidents who
backed the Shepherd bill appeared to have helped liberalize the
government proposals.
   Two major previous attempts at reform, in 1971 and 1979,
foundered largely on criticisms they did not go far enough.
   Newspaper editors said the new proposals were less restrictive
than anticipated, but complained that publication of secret
material in the public interest or because it had already been
published elsewhere should be legitimate defenses.
   ``We believe they (the defenses) would have helped avert
nonsenses such as we have recently had to endure in the guise of
protecting official secrets,'' said James Bishop, chairman of the
Association of British Editors.
   Several prestigious national newspapers are fighting
prosecutions for publishing material from or about ``Spycatcher.''
Wright's book, banned from sale in Britain, has been a best-seller
worldwide.

<HEAD>California Lawmaker Undergoes Heart Surgery, Doing Well</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Glenn Anderson, chairman of the House
Public Works and Transportation Committee, had multiple bypass
heart surgery Wednesday and was doing well, his office said.
   Surgery was performed on the 75-year-old California Democrat at
Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, Anderson spokesman David
Smallen said. The congressman was expected to return home to San
Pedro, Calif., by July 4, Smallen said.
   Anderson succeeded Rep. James Howard, D-N.J., as chairman of the
public works committee after Howard died last March 25 following a
heart attack.
   Smallen said the surgery on Anderson, who had no history of
heart problems, was ``elective'' and ``routine.'' He said the
lawmaker had planned to have the procedure performed during the
congressional recess in August, but moved up the date after
learning that his surgeon would be taking a long vacation beginning
later this week.
   Anderson probably will miss the Democratic national convention
in Atlanta next month, Smallen said, which he was scheduled to
attend as a delegate for the likely candidate, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis. He is expected to return to Washington after the
convention.
   Anderson has been in Congress for 20 years. Known as a quiet
legislator who is happy to sidestep controversy, he was lieutenant
governor of California from 1959 to 1967, and a member of the state
Assembly from 1943 to 1951. He began his political career when he
became mayor of Hawthorne, Calif., in 1941.

<HEAD>State Attorney Defends Use Of Bogus Lab Reports To Obtain
Confession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities used phony lab reports to
help get a confession from a man in the rape and murder of his
5-year-old niece, and the man's lawyer is seeking a special
investigation.
   The prosecutor defended the action.
   ``I would not encourage these unusual investigative tactics
except in very rare circumstances,'' Lee County State Attorney
Joseph D'Allesando said Tuesday. ``We believe it was better to use
whatever tactic was legal than to see this atrocious crime go
unavenged.''
   ``Here they're manufacturing evidence that isn't true. We're
talking about fundamental fairness,'' said the man's attorney,
Deputy Public Defender Robert Jacobs.
   Jacobs has asked Gov. Bob Martinez to appoint a special
prosecutor to find out if the prosecutors used the fake memos _ or
Paul David Cayward's alleged confession _ when arguing their case
before the grand jury. If so, Jacobs said, he will ask that the
charges be dismissed. A hearing on the request is set for Friday.
   Paris Massey was found dead in her bed on Dec. 19, 1987. Her
uncle, of Fort Myers, allegedly confessed in April after he was
shown fake lab reports linking him to the crime.
   On May 3, a grand jury indicted Cayward on charges of
first-degree murder and sexual battery of a child, both capital
crimes. He has pleaded innocent and is being held in the Lee County
Jail awaiting trial Sept. 12.
   D'Alessandro said at a news conference that his investigators
drafted one fake lab report, while Cape Coral police drafted
another.
   The state attorney's fake report used the letterhead and logo of
Lifecodes Corp., a New York lab hired to analyze DNA evidence in
the case.
   The April 7 report said a DNA ``print'' taken from blood and
semen found in the child's underwear matched a genetic print found
in a hair sample taken from Cayward. It said the probability that
the genetic match was incorrect was one in 12 million.
   The actual Lifecodes report, dated April 12, concluded that
investigators didn't send them enough physical evidence to make a
DNA print. Ronald Dorazio, a Lifecodes vice president, said the
company did not authorize the fake letter.
   ``If the idea of using a bogus report is acceptable, they ought
to make up a fictitious company,'' he said. ``They shouldn't use
our logo.''
   Cape Coral police drafted their fake report under the letterhead
of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement without authorization.
It said said a hair sample taken from Cayward matched one found in
the girl's underwear.
   FDLE's actual reports did not find any hair samples that matched.
   Lt. Al Caiata, a spokesman for Cape Coral police, refused to
answer questions Tuesday. ``I can't give you any information. We're
referring everything to the State Attorney's office. I can't say
anything.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the U.S.
government does not have legal authority to close the Palestine
Liberation Organization's observer mission to the United Nations.
   The Justice Department maintained that last year's
Anti-Terrorism Act, which branded the PLO a terrorist group,
empowered the government to close the PLO's U.N. mission.
   But U.S. District Judge Edmund Palmieri found that the act does
not supersede U.S. obligations to the 1947 agreement that brought
U.N. headquarters to New York.
   In a 37-page opinion, Palmieri wrote that the language of the
U.S-U.N. Headquarters Agreement, as well as longstanding practice,
``leave no doubt that it places an obligation upon the United
States to refrain from impairing the function of the PLO observer
mission.''
   Palmieri dismissed the government's lawsuit with prejudice _
meaning it cannot be brought again _ although his ruling could be
appealed to a higher court.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who argued the government's case
before Palmieri earlier this month, said he and the Justice
Department were studying the ruling ``and we will make a decision,
as to further proceedings as soon as possible.''
   The head of the PLO mission in New York hailed the decision as a
victory for international law.
   ``The United Nations now has no fear that the host country, or
any host country, can violate its legal obligations and get out
scot-free,'' Zehdi Labib Terzi, permanent observer of the PLO, told
The Associated Press.
   Lawyers for the PLO, including former U.S. Attorney General
Ramsey Clark, had argued that closing the mission would violate
international law because the Headquarters Agreement called for
arbitration of disputes between the United States and the United
Nations.
   They maintained that Palmieri lacked jurisdiction and should
defer to an advisory opinion from the International Court of
Justice, which said the United States was bound to submit to
arbitration.
   But Palmieri rejected those arguments for two reasons. First, he
said, U.S. courts are not empowered to order the executive branch
of government to submit to international arbitration on a question
of foreign policy, and secondly, only U.S. courts are empowered to
interpret U.S. laws.
   However, the judge noted that the language and legislative
history of the Anti-Terrorism Act, which branded the PLO a
terrorist group, do not indicate Congress meant to abandon the
country's obligations under the Headquarters Agreement.
   ``We are therefore constrained to interpret the ATA as failing
to supersede the Headquarters Agreement and inapplicable to the
mission,'' wrote Palmieri.
   The Justice Department had filed suit in March seeking to close
the PLO mission, citing the Anti-Terrorism Act passed by Congress
and reluctantly signed by President Reagan last year.
   The law, which took effect March 21, labeled the PLO and its
affiliates ``a terrorist organization and a threat to interests of
the United States.''
   The law barred the PLO from operating its U.N. Mission or any
other office in the United States and also barred the PLO from
funding any activities in this country to further its aims.

<TEXT>
   The Woman's National Democratic Club, born in
1922 of the suffrage movement, voted Wednesday to grant its male
members the right to vote.
   Outgoing club President Jean R. Jensen said it was ironic that
men now seek full membership in clubs founded to give women a say
in what once was the male world of politics.
   ``Perhaps it is a measure of our success that women's clubs are
being asked to include men,'' she said.
   Club members agreed by voice vote and without dissent to give
men full membership status. The organization has nearly 2,000
members, of whom 85 are men who, as associate members, could
participate in all ways except that they could not head committees,
become officers or vote.
   Ms. Jensen said that while the men have enjoyed the ``business
and networking opportunities'' that come with socializing and
participating in activities at the club's stately mansion, they
have been slow to volunteer to work on projects and committees.
   ``We'll have to work on the men to get them more involved,'' she
said.
   The club's decision to grant men full membership status comes on
the heels of votes by Washington's exclusive Metropolitan and
Cosmos clubs to end their men-only policies.
   In addition, the Supreme Court this month upheld a New York City
law that bars discimination against women and minorities by large,
private clubs where business deals often are arranged.
   Ms. Jensen said the decision of the woman's club to admit men
was unrelated, and had been approved by the organization's
governing board in April as part of a year-long project to revise
the club's bylaws.
   John F. Banzhaf III, a law professor at George Washington
University who had filed discrimination complaints against the
Cosmos, Metropolitan and Democratic Woman's clubs, welcomed the
latest vote, saying ``they're falling like 10-pins.''
   He said that while he was less concerned about the potential
discriminatory impact of women-only clubs than about men-only
organizations, ``you've got to have sauce for the goose and sauce
for the gander.''
   The woman's club's activities include sponsoring trips,
seminars, conferences, speaker luncheons and dinners, providing
volunteers for various Democratic campaigns and developing position
papers on issues.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government weather forecasters offered scant
cheer to drought-plagued areas Wednesday, issuing a series of
forecasts that call for more of the same, at least for the next
month.
   ``It's likely to get worse before it gets better,'' said Dr.
Michael Hudlow, director of hydrology for the National Weather
Service.
   The overall outlook calls for little change in the weather for
the next week or two. Hot, dry weather will continue but shift its
emphasis eastward and southward over the next one to three months,
said Dr. Donald L. Gilman, head of the agency's Long Range
Predictions Group.
   The lone bit of good news, if it comes in time, was a chance of
above-normal moisture in some western sections of the Great Plains
sometime in the next 90 days.
   ``Unfortunately, reliable predictions of the drought's end, its
geographic spread or changes in severity cannot be made today,''
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cautioned in a
statement issued at a news briefing.
   High-altitude jet stream winds that normally sweep across the
northern tier of states have split to the north and south, Gilman
said, holding the drought conditions in place between them.
   The 6-to-10-day outlook is ``very close to holding stationary
the pattern of the last few weeks,'' Gilman said.
   In that short time span, the outlook calls for much-above-normal
temperatures in Montana, Wyoming, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Wisconsin
and Iowa.
   In addition, above-normal readings are expected in much of the
rest of the nation except the Columbia River valley, West Texas and
along the Atlantic Coast from North Carolina through Georgia and
northern Florida.
   In the short range, the rain forecast is ``patchy,'' said
Gilman. He said no precipitation is likely in Oregon, California,
Nevada, southern Idaho, western Utah, western Arizona and Texas.
   There is a chance of some scattered moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico causing rain here and there in the Midwest. But only Kansas,
South Carolina and Georgia seem likely to have more rain than
normal for the period.
   Turning to the 30-day forecast for July, above-normal heat is
expected throughout most of the northern Plains and upper Midwest,
Gilman said, while the outlook for rain is ``very uncertain.''
   The greatest chance of hot weather is in Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, Gilman said. He gave that region a 65
percent chance of being hotter than normal for July, an unusually
high ranking for a summer forecast. Outlooks for 30 days normally
carry only a 55 percent probability.
   In addition, July has a chance of warmer-than-normal weather
from Pennsylvania west through the Great Lakes states to Montana,
south to Oklahoma and Arkansas and east to the Appalachian
Mountains.
   The rest of the country should expect near-normal readings in
July except the Puget Sound region, where is it expected to be
cooler than normal.
   The outlook for rain in July shows below-normal readings
expected for California, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and
Kentucky. Above-normal precipitation is expected only in Puget
Sound and along the Arizona-New Mexico border.
   Other regions are likely to be close to normal, Gilman said, but
the below-normal region could expand back into the Plains.
   Gilman said that if it were earlier in the year, he would have
predicted a larger dry area, but there may be breaks in the jet
stream which could allow some rain to move north from the Gulf of
Mexico.
   The Weather Service also issued a 90-day forecast for July,
August and September.
   That outlook anticipates above-normal temperatures along the
Pacific Coast, in southern Arizona and in Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, the Carolinas,
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida.
   Below-normal temperatures are expected in Idaho, Montana,
Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico, with near-normal readings
elsewhere.
   The three-month rain outlook is for below-normal amounts in
California, Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia and parts of
West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky.
   The lone bit of good news may be the chance of above-normal
precipitation for Montana, Wyoming, southern South Dakota,
Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, West Texas and western
Oklahoma over the 90 days.
   For the rest of the nation the chances are too close to call
over such a long period, Gilman said.

<HEAD>Family Takes Woman From Convent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old woman, taken from a New York
convent by her family, will be free to return after she hears her
family's concerns about the institution, a brother said.
   Mary Susan Greve, known as Sister Mary Cecelia, was walking with
two nuns on a street in a Catskill Mountains town Sunday when her
father and her three brothers pushed her into a car and took her
away.
   New York state police have said they would not press charges
unless the woman wants to file them.
   John Greve, 16, declined Tuesday to say where his sister and the
rest of the family were staying.
   The family, he said, opposed his sister's decision to become a
novice at St. Joseph Novitiate Convent in Roundtop, N.Y., after the
family broke with a traditionalist Catholic church in Sharonville,
a Cincinnati suburb.
   The Rev. Michael A. Farano, chancellor of the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Albany, N.Y., said the St. Joseph Novitiate Convent
calls itself a traditionalist Roman Catholic convent.
   However, he said, it is not recognized by the Catholic Church.
Its services are in Latin and it has rejected all of the teachings
of the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s, he added.
   ``The reason we did this was to give her the facts,'' John Greve
said, referring to the incident Sunday.
   If she wants to return to the convent after she hears her family
out, she is free to do so, he said. ``But we know that will be the
last time we will probably ever see her again,'' he said.
   Sunday was the second time the family has taken the woman from
the convent, John Greve said. His mother, he said, went to the
convent in April, tricked her daughter into getting into the car
and flew her back to Cincinnati, where a nun from the convent was
waiting for them. The nun succeeded in persuading the woman to
return to the convent.
   A sister-in-law, Gina Greve, said the convent's spiritual
adviser, the Rev. Clarence Kelly, has forbidden Mary Susan Greve
from seeing or talking to family members.
   ``He said they cannot let her go back to her family because we
would be an evil influence and jeopardize her vocation,'' she said.
   Kelly said Tuesday that his concern was for the young woman. ``I
hope the parents come to their senses, leave her be and let her
live her own life.''
   John Greve said he and two brothers, Dave and Mark, and his
parents, James and Susan Greve, participated in the most recent
incident. The father and the brothers took the sister from the
convent, while the mother waited in a motel, he said.

<TEXT>
   An underwater telephone cable was
accidentally cut Wednesday, interrupting service to much of the
Florida Keys, a spokeswoman for Southern Bell said.
   ``Apparently a barge came through and cut one of our cables at
Snake Creek Bridge,'' said company spokeswoman Paula Guerrein in
Miami.
   She said the company was inspecting the damage, and did not yet
know how many customers were affected or when the break would be
repaired.
   Only the 664 exchange in Islamorada was completely dead, she
said. Residents to the south can make local calls, but cannot make
long distance calls north of the break, and no one can call south
of Islamorada on land lines.
   ``We're working as hard as we can,'' she said.
   Ms. Guerrein said cable cuts along the narrow strip of Key
islands are not uncommon.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Spurted In May As Drought Set In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products in June
rose 3.7 percent from May, a drought-spurred jump that carried the
overall index up 6.9 percent from a year ago, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that higher prices for soybeans, corn and wheat
contributed most to the June increase. Lower prices for cattle and
peaches partly offset the rise in other commodities.
   ``Most grain prices moved up sharply in June, reflecting the
widespread drought,'' the report said. ``The average soybean price
was at the highest level since May of 1977 and the fifth highest on
record. Corn and wheat also moved up sharply to the highest levels
since August of 1985 and May of 1984, respectively.''
   According to the preliminary June figures, based mostly on
mid-month averages, the index for crop prices was up 10 percent
from May and averaged 18 percent more than a year ago.
   The livestock price index dropped 2.6 percent from May and
averaged 1.3 percent below the year-ago level.
   As a commodity group, prices of feed grains and hay _ in great
demand for livestock in the stricken drought areas _ rose 20
percent from May to June, averaging 40 percent above a year ago.
   Prices of food grains, mostly wheat but also including rice,
rose 14 percent during the month and averaged 14 percent higher
than in May. The June index was up 49 percent from June 1987. All
of the May-June rise was due to higher wheat prices, while rice
prices declined during the month.
   The index of prices for oil-bearing crops, which mostly involves
soybeans, jumped 19 percent from its May average and was 48 percent
more than in June 1987. Preliminary figures showed soybean prices
averaged $8.56 per bushel, up $1.57 from May.
   Lower prices for cattle and calves were mostly responsible for
the June decline in the livestock price index. Prices of beef
cattle, generally, fell to an average of $65.20 per hundredweight
in June from $69.30 in May. Calf prices dropped $6.70 to $86.70 in
June.
   Many farmers and ranchers have been forced by drought to send
cattle to slaughter or to feedlots as pastures and and ranges
continue to burn up. That has put extra animals on the market and
depressed prices.
   The price index for poultry and eggs, collectively, rose 7.5
percent from May to June and averaged 11 percent more than a year
ago.
   Besides the decline in livestock prices, the fruit index dropped
6.7 percent from May and averaged 7.1 percent lower than in June
1987. ``Prices for peaches, grapefruit, oranges and strawberries
were lower than the previous month,'' the report said.
   Although the projections are subject to review as more is known
about 1988 crop and livestock production, USDA economists say now
that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $53 billion
to $59 billion this year, down from the record level of $56 billion
in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash
expenses during the calendar year.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
Before the drought took hold, USDA was predicting a 1988 food price
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent. No forecast has been made by the
department for 1989.
   No new figures for farm production costs were included in the
report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages because of
budget cutbacks.
   In April, however, farm expenses were up 1.8 percent from
January and averaged 3.7 percent above a year earlier. The April
figures were carried forward into June, with the next revision
scheduled in July.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $65.20 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, down from $69.30 in May but up from $62.50 reported for
June 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $47.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $46.30 in
May and $59.20 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.43 a bushel, was up from $1.95 in May and the
average of $1.69 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.50 per bushel, compared with $2.99 in May and $2.44 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.31 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.71 in May
and $3.62 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $8.56 per bushel, compared with $6.99 in May and
$5.36 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 60.4 cents per pound, compared
with 58.9 in May and 66.2 cents in June 1987.
   _Eggs were 45.7 cents per dozen, compared with 43.1 cents in May
and 50 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $11.30 per 100 pounds, compared with $11.40 in May and
$11.90 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 36.7 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
33.5 cents in May and 27.6 cents a year ago.

<HEAD>Court Ruling Could Set 16 as Minimum Age for Capital Punishment</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court, in a decision that may
signal an end to capital punishment for young killers, overturned
an Oklahoma man's death sentence Wednesday.
   Four of the eight justices who voted in the case said the death
penalty for convicted murderers who committed their crimes before
reaching age 16 always amounts to unlawfully ``cruel and unusual
punishment.''
   Three justices said the Constitution imposes no such age
limitation on imposing capital punishment.
   In her controlling vote, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor voiced
serious doubts whether states may execute people for crimes
committed when only 15.
   ``Although I believe that a national consensus forbidding the
execution of any person for a crime committed before the age of 16
very likely does exist, I am reluctant to adopt this conclusion as
a matter of constitutional law without better evidence than we now
possess,''' O'Connor said.
   But she supplied a fifth vote to overturn Oklahoma death row
inmate's William Wayne Thompson's death sentence, ruling that the
state's death penalty law could not be applied to him because the
law has no minimum age.
   ``There is a considerable risk that the Oklahoma Legislature
either did not realize that its actions would have the effect of
rendering 15-year-old defendants death-eligible or did not give the
question serious consideration,'' O'Connor said.
   She added that Thompson and others who committed their crimes
before age 16 ``may not be executed under the authority of a
capital punishment statute that specifies no minimum age at which
the commission of a capital crime can lead to the offender's
execution.''
   But Wednesday's ruling left unclear whether O'Connor would vote
to strike down a death penalty law that explicitly made 15-year-old
murderers eligible for execution.
   The decision also left unclear whether the court would find
fault with death penalty laws in which convicted killers who were
16 or 17 when they committed their crimes are eligible for
execution.
   ``As a practical matter, 15 year olds wil not be executed in
this country,'' predicted Paul L. Hoffman, a Los Angeles lawyer who
represented Amnesty International in urging the justices to abolish
capital punishment for juveniles.
   ``Justice O'Connor walked right up to the edge of saying that,''
Hoffman said.
   In Oklahoma, Assistant Attorney General David Lee said, ``The
line has been drawn, in my opinion. Our reading of the opinion is
that (the court) used 16 as the line.''
   If Hoffman and Lee are correct, the decision will affect only
about 30 of the some 2,100 death row inmates nationwide.
   Of the 100 men and women executed in U.S. prisons since the
Supreme Court in 1976 allowed states to resume capital punishment,
three died for murders committed when they were 17.
   Charles Rumbaugh was executed in Texas in 1985; James Terry
Roach in South Carolina in 1986; and Jay Pinkerton in Texas in 1986.
   Since 1948, no one has been executed in this country for a crime
committed when he or she was younger than 17.
   Of the 37 states with death penalty laws, 19 of them do not
specify a minimum age. Of the 18 state laws that do impose a
minimum age, none of them allows execution of killers younger than
16 when they committed their crimes.
   Thirteen states and the District of Columbia do not allow
capital punishment.
   Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun voted to ban the death penalty for
any crime committed by someone not yet 16.
   Writing for the four, Stevens said imposing death to such
criminals ``is nothing more than the purposeless and needless
imposition of pain and suffering, and thus an unconstitutional
punishment.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Byron R. White voted to let Thompson die. Writing for the
three, Scalia said he found ``Thompson's age inadequate grounds for
reversal of his sentence.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court after
Thompson's case was argued, did not participate in the case.
   Thompson, now 20, was one of four people convicted in the Jan.
29, 1983, death in Grady County, Okla., of Charles Keene, his
former brother-in-law.
   All four, including Thompson's older brother, were sentenced to
death. Thompson was the only juvenile.
   Police said Keene was beaten, stabbed, shot and thrown into a
river.

   Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre ordained 16
priests Wednesday, the day before a consecration of four bishops
that will automatically expel the rebel traditionalist from the
Roman Catholic Church.
   He urged the new priests to fight the ``cancer of liberalism''
in the church, which the 82-year-old archbishop says has been
infiltrated by ``wolves and thieves.''
   Organizers estimated the ceremony attracted at least 7,000
people to a rolling meadow in front of Lefebvre's seminary in this
Swiss hamlet.
   Sympathizers came from all over Western Europe, many in buses.
More than 1,000 cars were parked around the huge tent, which also
will be the scene of Thursday's consecration.
   Lefebvre says bishops must be consecrated so his traditionalist
movement will continue after he dies. Church law provides automatic
excommunication of those involved if bishops are consecrated
without papal approval.
   Pope John Paul II said Tuesday he was ``very saddened'' by
Lefebvre's ``breaking the unity of the church (and) taking with him
a large number of followers into schism.''
   Vatican officials said a performance of Beethoven's Missa
Solemnis, scheduled for Thursday evening in the Paul VI Auditorium,
was canceled because of the ``deep pain'' felt by the church over
the Lefebvre affair.
   The last major schism, or split in the church, occurred when the
so-called Old Catholics broke with Rome in 1870 after the First
Vatican Council proclaimed the doctrine of papal infallibility.
   Repeated pleas by the pontiff have failed to impress the French
archbishop, who has said excommunication is ``without value'' and
ignored previous Vatican sanctions.
   Before Wednesday's ceremony, he had ordained more than 220
traditionalist priests since Pope Paul VI suspended him from
priestly functions in 1976. The Vatican considers all the
ordinations illegal.
   Most of the 16 new priests are French graduates of the seminary
of Lefebvre's St. Pius X Fraternity, which he founded 18 years ago
in Econe and named for the pope who condemned modernism in a 1907
encyclical.
   Also among the new priests were West German, Italian, Spanish,
Australian and British nationals and an American, James H. Doran,
25, son of an automotive designer in Detroit.
   Lefebvre's rebellion began with the Second Vatican Council of
1962-65, whose liberal reforms included modernizing the liturgy. He
continued celebrating Mass in Latin, using the 16th century
Tridentine rite, and dismissed the ``bastard rites'' in the
vernacular that took its place.
   He speaks of the ``satanic influence'' of liberalism in the
church, preaches against ``neo-modernist and neo-Protestant
tendencies'' and proclaims: ``Our future is the past.''
   In his homily Wednesday, Lefebvre did not refer directly to the
impending excommunication but repeated his argument that he is not
the one causing schism.
   ``He who breaks with tradition breaks with the church,''
Lefebvre told the new priests, and urged them to fight ``the cancer
of liberalism'' he says has been spreading since the Second Vatican
Council.
   They will suffer ``persecution,'' he added, but ``whatever you
may be told, you will remain Catholic.''
   Antonio de Castro Mayer of Campos, Brazil, who is 84 and the
only bishop to support Lefebvre publicly, assisted him at the
ceremony.
   Among the spectators were nuns in white, Dominican monks in
yellow robes and 50 supporters of Lefebvre from Gabon, dressed in
African garb and mingling with the crowd. Lefebvre was a missionary
in Gabon for 13 years and later was named archbishop of Dakar,
Senegal.
   About a dozen people questioned at random said the Vatican
warnings left them unshaken in their loyalty to Lefebvre view.
   ``History will prove that he is right,'' said Mark Simmons, a
29-year-old London accountiong clerk who was among about 200
British sympathizers.
   Some supporters said they expect an eventual settlement with the
Vatican.
   ``Sooner or later, Rome will recognize the fruits of Monsignor
Lefebvre's work,'' said Doran, the American ordained.
   Speculation about a new last-minute appeal from the pope stirred
when a priest arrived in the official car of the Vatican ambassador
to Switzerland but would not say why he had come.
   Edoardo Rovida, the ambassador, was reached by telephone at his
office in Bern and asked whether his aide brought a letter from the
pope. ``There are always letters to be brought,'' he replied, and
refused to elaborate.

<NOTE>EDs: ADDS 1 graf with Shultz not planning Middle East visit in

<TEXT>
   The United States and Israel agreed Wednesday
to work together on the development of a new tactical missile
designed to shoot down Arab ballistic rockets which could be fired
at Israeli population centers.
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin called the Arrow project
a response to ``push-button'' warfare in which Arab foes were
relying on Soviet and Chinese rockets to try pierce Israeli
defenses.
   He said the missile should be ready for testing in two to three
years, with a decision on production depending on the results.
   The agreement was signed at a Pentagon ceremony by Maj. Gen.
David Ivry, director general of the Israeli defense ministry, and
Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, who is in charge of the U.S. Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   Israel is collaborating with the United States in the search for
a space-based defense against Soviet ballistic missiles. The
program, known popularly as Star Wars, anticipates using kinetic
energy, lasers and other sophisticated technology to destroy the
rockets before they could reach their U.S. targets.
   Rabin stressed in a speech at the National Press Club that
Israel's objectives were much more limited. He said if the Arrow
proved effective in the tests the missile might be used as a
defensive weapon at short-range.
   The Israeli official said Israel had to find a way to cope with
the new missiles the Soviets had supplied to Syria and the Chinese
to Saudi Arabia. He said the Syrian missiles could reach almost
every target in Israel.
   For the Arabs, who have fought six major wars with Israel since
1948, the rockets offer a chance to accomplish what Arab armies and
air forces could not achieve, Rabin said.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, at a separate news
conference, said the Arrow ``would make a contribution to our SDI
program, and have application, as well, in other areas.''
   He said the joint project ``fits in very well with our concept
of deterrence based on defense.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who appeared with Carlucci
at the windup of separate talks with Australian officials, said
``if you happen to be sitting in Israel, with shorter-range
ballistic missiles around you that are very hard to defend against,
you feel very strongly the importance of learning how to defend
yoursevles against them.''
   A Pentagon statement said 80 percent of the cost would be borne
by the United States and 20 percent by Israel.
   The signing followed a statement of concern Tuesday by President
Reagan after a meeting at the White House with Rabin. The president
said he was troubled by ``ominous new military developments'' in
the area.
   Rabin, during two days of talks here, has stressed Soviet
deliveries of new missiles to Syria and Libya, and Chinese
shipments to Saudi Arabia.
   ``If the United States could not persuade China and Saudi
Arabia, I doubt Israel would be able to persuade the Soviet
Union,'' to refrain from the deliveries, Rabin said.
   Israel has had a series of diplomatic meetings recently with
Soviet officials that indicate a warming by Moscow to the Jewish
state, with which it broke relations in 1967.
   On another subject, Rabin criticized American television
networks and other media for giving much less coverage to missile
attacks by Iran and Iraq on each other's cities and other war
atrocitiies than to the beatings of Palestinian Arabs on the West
Bank.
   Rabin said he was used to having a ``double-standard'' applied
to Israel, but he believed the networks should have devoted more
than a few minutes to what he said was the slaying of 5,000 Kurds
by Iraq with chemical weapons.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said Shultz had no
plans to visit the Middle East in July. The possibility of such a
trip was raised when Michael H. Armacost, undersecretary of state
for political affairs, told reporters in Israel he discussed the
issue with Israeli leaders.

<TEXT>
   A test case has shown that a government
takeover can restore some democracy to a corrupt Teamsters local,
but the battle is far from over, the local's court-appointed
trustee said Wednesday.
   And labor observers stressed that the experience of Teamsters
Local 560 in Union City does not mean the Justice Department will
be able to meet the far more ambitious goal it announced Tuesday _
wresting control from the union's international leaders.
   The success of a government takeover could depend on how much
power a judge grants to a trustee, said Herman Benson, director of
the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Association for Union Democracy, a
non-partisan union rights group.
   To eliminate union corruption, ``you have to have massive
government interaction,'' said Benson.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in New York filed suit Tuesday
describing the Teamsters as dominated by the Mafia, seeking to have
a federal judge remove from office any union officials who violated
racketeering laws and appoint a trustee to supervise free elections.
   In 1984, U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman ruled that a
takeover of Local 560 was necessary because of a quarter-century of
brutal organized crime domination at the hands of the Provenzano
family. Ackerman appointed a trustee to clean up the local and
bring on free elections.
   It was the first time a union had been placed under government
control.
   Benson points to recent improvements in allowing the 8,500
members of Local 560 a voice in their union. He said the changes
have come under stewardship of Edwin Steir, a former federal
prosecutor on the job about a year.
   ``I see enormous change since I've gotten here,'' said Steir,
citing discussion of past corruption among the rank and file.
   ``People say things they've never said before,'' he said.
   However, ``there's still fear here and there's a lot of
uncertainty'' about how to assert dissenting views, he said.
   Attorney Harvey Weissbard, who represents Local 560's last
president, Michael Sciarra, said Giuliani's office is going to face
some ``high-powered (legal) talent'' and the prospect of lengthy
appeals, which could also bog down the process.
   Sciarra dismissed Tuesday's lawsuit as a politically motivated,
union-busting move that signaled a ``dark day for labor.'' Sciarra
has the support of a large and vocal group of Local 560 members.
About 2,000 people appeared at a recent rally for him.
   Two candidates have emerged to oppose Sciarra, who rose to power
under the deposed leadership.
   Weissbard said he plans to file a motion later this week to
overturn Ackerman's 1984 decision based on a recent Supreme Court
ruling. A group of 260 truckers who joined the union after 1984
have also sued to end the trusteeship.
   The trustee took over Local 560 in 1986, after an appeals courts
upheld Ackerman. But only in recent months have forces organized to
oppose the former allies of jailed ex-president Anthony ``Tony
Pro'' Provenzano, who authorities say is a captain in the Genovese
crime family.
   He has been linked to the unsolved disappearance of national
Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa in 1975.
   Steir says he has had trouble building democracy because of a
tradition of suppression of dissent that made fear and cynicism his
main enemies.
   Benson said the very size of the international union could be an
asset in allowing more open discussion among the rank and file.
``The international, at least, is not one monolithic block of
crooks,'' he said.
   On the other hand, said labor law expert Michael Goldberg, a
University of Pittsburgh law school associate professor, a trustee
of the international will have to contend with thousands of local
leaders who may not cooperate.
   New York University law professor James Jacobs pointed out that
the function of a local and the international are different, and it
is difficult to draw conclusions from Local 560's experience.
   ``There you're really running a union at the grass roots,'' he
said. In the international's case, ``you're talking about an
overarching management of the whole administration.''
   Whether Local 560 has been freed from the taint of organized
crime is still an open question.
   Federal prosecutors earlier this year questioned Sciarra and
former vice president Joseph Sheridan at a deposition where they
sought to find out whether reputed Genovese crime family captain
Matthew ``Matty the Horse'' Ianniello influenced union decisions.
   On a tape of a secretly recorded conversation in 1984, Ianniello
is heard saying to a Local 560 official, ``I think Mike Sciarra
should take over there.''

   Stephen Wang Jr., a young investment analyst
trainee charged in the second-biggest insider-trading scandal in
Wall Street history, was always a ``make-a-buck kind of person,''
recalled his high school sweetheart.
   ``He said he wanted to make his first million by (age) 30,''
said Gloria Lowry of north suburban Skokie, Ill. ``He was always
scheming _ coming up with ways to make money.''
   Ms. Lowry dated Wang, 24, as a teen-ager in Arlington Heights,
the northwest suburb in which both were raised.
   Other acquaintances remembered Wang as a bright, driven young
man who left the University of Illinois just two credits shy of an
undergraduate degree to pursue his ambitions with a major New York
investment firm.
   Wang, a junior investment analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co., was
accused Monday in a civil case of participating in an illegal
insider-trading scheme that allegedly netted $19 million. Wang
received at least $200,000, according to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   ``My wife and I said someday he'd be a millionaire, but this is
a shock,'' said Tom Walsh, 33, a neighbor of Wang's father, Stephen
Sr., a Taiwan-born engineer and stepmother, Pat, who still live in
the house where Wang, his brother and two sisters grew up.
   Wang's parents have an unlisted telephone number and could not
be reached Wednesday. But an account in The Wall Street Journal on
Wednesday quoted his father as saying his son remains hopeful he'll
be cleared of wrongdoing.
   The father also was quoted as saying his son denied breaking any
laws and was taken advantage of by the man alleged to be his
co-conspirator, Taiwan-born businessman Fred C. Lee, a Morgan
client.
   ``He might have let one or two things slip that (Lee) made money
on,'' the elder Wang was quoted as saying. ``But he didn't mean
to.''
   Wang was an active youth who mowed lawns and shoveled snow to
earn money and often organized other children to do chorse for him,
said Kathleen Paul, a neighbor who has known him for 20 years.
   ``Money was a very high priority for him when he was a child,''
she said.
   After graduating with good grades from Buffalo Grove High
School, where he played on the basketball and baseball teams, Wang
enrolled in 1982 at the University of Illinois. He first studied
political science but switched his major to finance and accounting,
according to school records.
   As a freshman, Wang developed and sold a coupon book called
``The Student Survival Kit.'' He persuaded retailers to place
coupons in the book, which he sold to students for $2.
   In a 1983 interview with the Illini Times, a weekly newspaper
distributed on campus, Wang said he had derived more satisfaction
from the experience of the coupon project than from the undisclosed
amount of money it made.
   ``We're put on this earth to achieve,'' Wang said. ``If you love
what you do, money comes along with it.''
   Wang left college in the spring of 1986 and was hired by Morgan
for a two-year internship. The firm usually recruits college
graduates for the program but made an exception for Wang.
   ``I can't tell you two years back what went into the decision
but we were well aware that when he came here, Mr. Wang didn't have
a degree,'' Morgan spokesman Lawrence Friedman said.
   Nevertheless, Wang circulated a resume on Wall Street last year
in which he claimed he had graduated magna cum laude with a finance
degree from the university, according to an account in The New York
Times.
   Wang, who was paid about $31,000 last year, would have finished
the two-year Morgan training program Friday, Friedman said. Wang
has been suspended pending an investigation of the SEC charges.

   A rare military cargo plane that was to be
exhibited at an Air Force museum crashed shortly after takeoff
Wednesday, slightly injuring the two men aboard, officials said.
   The three-engine YC-125 skidded to a halt at an intersection
northwest of Tulsa International Airport, ripping down power lines
and briefly knocking out power to the airport control tower.
   No one on the ground was hurt, officials said. Firefighters
doused a blaze that broke out around the left wing, which was
ripped off when it was punctured by a metal fence pole.
   Darryl George Greenamyer, 51, of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., and
Ascher Ward, 53, of Sepulveda, Calif., walked away from the crash
without serious injuries, officials said.
   The aircraft, one of only two of the type remaining, was
destined for the U.S. Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, said museum spokeswoman Linda Smith.
   She said 23 of the aircraft were manufactured beginning in 1948
and they were declared surplus in 1955. Ms. Smith said the only
other surviving plane that officials know of is at a Tucson, Ariz.,
museum.
   Ms. Smith and Gary Pester, a spokesman for Tulsa airport
operations, both said they did not know whether the plane was
making a test flight or was actually en route to Dayton.
   Ms. Smith said museum had been expecting the plane any day.
   John Mizell, area supervisor of the airport control tower, said
the tower switched to standby generators to operate until full
power could be restored. He said no commercial traffic was affected.
   Investigators were at the scene Wednesday but had not determined
why the plane went down, said Leon Hise, manager of the Federal
Aviation Administration flight service at the airport.

   Mexico will be able to buy $40 million worth

   The arrangement involved switching $40 million from an existing

beef, pork or poultry. Lyng said the deal will ``help offset the
price-depressing impact'' of livestock liquidation due to drought.
   It was the second action this week by Lyng to help bolster

   The U.S. government seems content with the
dollar's sharp rise, which could have the paradoxical effect of
shrinking the trade deficit in the months leading up to the
November elections.
   Even though the dollar's strength of a few years ago helped gut
American manufacturing, the Reagan administration seems to believe
that the recent rise in the dollar is no cause for alarm and could
even be helpful.
   In spite of its recent rise, the dollar remains far below its
peak of early 1985.
   For now, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III may have
concluded that although there are dangers from a stronger dollar,
they are less fearsome than the dangers of a weaker dollar.
   If the dollar weakened, the United States would have to raise
interest rates sharply to keep foreigners interested in owning
dollar securities. And a big rise in interest rates could squelch
the 6-year-old economic expansion.
   With the dollar strengthening, the United States has more
latitude to set policy, economists said.
   ``It gives them a bit more room of maneuvering,'' said Shafiqul
Islam, senior fellow for finance at the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York.
   As a side benefit, a currency rise might make the trade deficit
smaller over the next several months because it takes fewer dollars
to buy a given volume of imports. And a given volume of exports
brings in more dollars.
   Eventually a stronger dollar would worsen the deficit because
the lower dollar price of imports would cause Americans to buy more
of them, while foreigners would decide American products had become
too expensive and switch away from them.
   A strong dollar gives a new perspective to America's trading
partners, which have gotten used to thinking of the U.S. currency
as an invalid in recent years.
   The world economy is unusually healthy in spite of forecasts of
doom after last October's worldwide stock market crash. It is so
healthy that central bankers are concerned their economies may
overheat, and they have been slowly nudging interest rates higher.
   The strength of the dollar has made it easier for central banks
in Europe and Japan to raise their rates, which is a politically
difficult decision because it tends to suppress economic growth.
   In turn, the increase of interest rates overseas gives the U.S.
Federal Reserve some room to raise interest rates here modestly as
anti-inflation medicine.
   The United States cannot raise rates too much for fear of
causing the dollar to shoot too high, but it does not want to
increase rates much anyway because too-high rates could choke off
the economy's growth.
   ``The dollar's strength is coming at an opportune time,'' said
Lawrence Leuzzi, an economist for S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York.
   At the Treasury Department, Baker is a close ally of Vice
President George Bush, the all-but-certain Republican nominee for
president. Baker may believe a modest rise in the dollar could
dampen inflation without causing the monthly trade deficits to
balloon.
   ``If you can go into the election with a strong economy, a
falling deficit and a strong dollar, that's a good combination,''
Islam said.
   The Federal Reserve is politically independent of the Reagan
administration, but Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan also seems to have
concluded the dollar's rise is at least tolerable.
   The Fed and the Treasury have taken only small steps to control
the rise of the dollar, which has shot up since June 14, the day
the Commerce Department announced a big improvement in the trade
deficit.
   Eventually the Federal Reserve and other central banks will
decide the dollar's rise has gone far enough and take steps to
knock it back down.
   ``The U.S., of course, doesn't want to see the benefits of the
decline of the dollar against the major currencies given up, so I
would imagine there would come a point where you would see more
forceful intervention,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist of
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.

<HEAD>Defense Contractors Big Contributors Of Honoraria</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading defense contractors contributed more
than two-thirds of the honoraria received by members of the House
and Senate committees responsible for defense-related legislation,
a liberal lobby organization said Wednesday.
   Common Cause said its review of public finance statements showed
Northrop Corp. paid the most in honoraria for speeches by members
of Congress. Seventy-eight percent of the $64,902 paid by Northrop
went to members of the defense committees, it said.
   The top 50 defense contracters, as determined by 1986 Pentagon
contracts, gave a total of $521,310 to members of the House and
Senate Armed Services committees and Appropriations subcommittees
on defense, Common Cause said.
   In all, members of Congress got $737,744 from the top defense
contractors in 1987, the group reported.
   Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said the contractors
``have been paying substantial fees to key members of Congress who
control defense decisions to buy their influence, not their
oratory.''
   Common Cause has long been active in fighting special interest
money in politics, contending that honoraria and campaign
contributions allow for too much influence by such interests.
   An Associated Press review found that last year, 37 of the 101
members who serve on the four military committees received $137,100
from defense contractors that have been publicly linked to the
current investigation in the Pentagon procurement case.
   That was part of the millions of dollars that those defense
contractors poured into the pockets and campaign accounts of the
committee members over the past several years, the AP review found.
   Lawmakers are permitted to take honoraria for speaking
engagements, but senators are limited to a total of $35,800 a year
and House members to $26,850 a year.
   The defense-related committees do not award contracts _ that is
the Pentagon's purview _ but they are responsible for appropriating
money to build weapons systems.

<HEAD>Bill Would Require All Employers to Offer Medical Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All employers would be required to offer
medical insurance to their workers under a bill introduced
Wednesday by Rep. Fortney H. Stark, who said the measure would
``move us a long way'' toward universal health insurance.
   The Employee Health Benefit Act is similar to a minimum health
bill awaiting Senate floor action.
   There are about 37 million Americans without health care
coverage, and two-thirds of them have jobs or are dependents of
people with jobs. In 1985, hospitals provided $7.4 billion in
charity care.
   The bill from Stark, chairman of the House Ways and Means health
subcommittee, would require employers to offer coverage of the same
services as Medicare plus maternal and child health benefits. It
would set up state risk pools to keep costs reasonable and put a
cap on the cost of group insurance purchased by small employers.
   Its enactment ``would move us a long way towards the target of
assuring every American's basic right to high-quality health
services,'' Stark, D-Calif., said in a floor statement submitted
for the record.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee in February
approved a similar bill sponsored by its chairman, Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass. But it is unclear when or if the full Senate will
consider it during this Congress. The same bill is pending in the
House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Expanded health care coverage is expected to be a priority in
the next Congress starting in January.

<HEAD>Decision Called Example of Mexican Sovereignty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGIO CARRASCO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government remained silent about
Washington's anger over the release of a Puerto Rican separatist,
but local editorials Wednesday praised the decision as an example
of national sovereignty.
   ``The Mexican government denied the extradition of William
Morales, and that is a decision that merits all the support of the
citizenry because it strengthens national sovereignty against
external pressures,'' the leftist newspaper Uno Mas Uno, or One
plus One, wrote.
   Morales, 37, is wanted in the United States for terrorist
activities.
   The daily La Jornada, a competing leftist paper, wrote that the
United States tried ``to magnify a diplomatic-political matter
whose limits are clearly defined'' and ``has taken the case of the
patriot William Morales as a new pretext for confrontation with
Mexico.''
   The editorial said that course ``can be risky for both
countries, especially because of the time and space in which the
conflict is introduced.''
   Both newspapers have followed the Morales case closely. La
Jornada broke the story earlier in June that the Foreign Ministry
decided to grant political asylum to Morales, who was in a Mexican
prison at the time.
   Last Friday, Morales was released after serving five years of an
eight-year sentence for murder and allowed to fly to Cuba. The
Cuban government has not made any statement about his presence on
that Caribbean island.
   As a sign of its displeasure, Washington recalled Ambassador
Charles J. Pilliod Jr. from Mexico City for consultations.
   ``This decision is an inexplicable affront to otherwise
excellent U.S.-Mexican relations and a great blow to U.S. and
Mexican efforts to combat the scourge of international terrorism,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   Pilliod last week wrote to La Jornada objecting to its editorial
praise for the Foreign Ministry's decision and its description of
U.S. policy on Puerto Rico as ``colonialism.''
   ``Mr. William Morales was tried, found guilty and sentenced by
state and federal courts in New York on the charges of possession
of explosives (homemade bombs and dynamite),'' Pilliod wrote.
   ``It concerns us very much that an individual with his criminal
record and who is a convicted criminal in both countries might be
considered worthy of the status of a political refugee,'' he added.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Tuesday that Mexico waited five days before informing the
United States of Morales' release.
   The newspaper Excelsior, which generally reflects government
positions, said Washington's announcement that it was recalling
Pilliod was ``accompanied by the Reagan administration's typical
language, which doesn't bode well.''
   In a front-page column, Excelsior said the news produced ``a
silence in all the country's political circles'' and now ``the
inevitable response that this announcement provoked must be
awaited, above all in these times on the eve of presidential
elections.''
   General elections are scheduled for July 6, with unusually
strong competition facing the Institutional Revolutionary Party
that has governed Mexico since 1929.
   Morales was sentenced to more than 100 years in prison in New
York but escaped from U.S. custody in 1979. He fled to Mexico,
where in 1983 he was convicted in the killing of a police officer
and for entering the country illegally.
   Tensions about the Morales case come at a time when both
governments have been emphasizing cooperation. The most recent
meeting between Presidents Reagan and Miguel de la Madrid in
February in the Pacific coastal resort of Mazatlan even minimized
the longstanding disputes over drug trafficking.
   U.S. officials at the State Department are making no secret of
their dislike for Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda, whose
department issued the decision on Morales' political asylum.
   The resolution signed by Sepulveda granting asylum said Morales,
who was badly disfigured in an explosion at a clandestine bomb
factory in New York, ``did not arrive at producing harm to society
or any individuals in particular, escept those he inflicted upon
himself.''
   In one of Morales' last interviews before leaving Mexico, he
told The Associated Press by telephone from the Northern
Penitentiary in Mexico City that the government's decision was ``a
political recognition of our fight'' for independence.
   He said he would not return to Puerto Rico ``because political
persecution continues over there. But I can say that the Mexican
government's decision reflects a very Latin American position.''
   Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States whose
residents have American citizenship but cannot vote in U.S.
presidential elections. Some Puerto Rican nationalist groups
advocate independence for the island but are split over whether to
use violence to attain their goal.

<TEXT>
   A concern about spreading AIDS through donated
blood, along with an improvement in surgical techniques, has led a
National Institutes of Health panel to recommend to doctors that
blood transfusions ``be kept to a minimum'' and that traditional
uses of blood be reevaluated.
   The chances of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome
from donated blood is still considered ``miniscule,'' said Tibor
Greenwalt, a University of Cincinnati researcher and chairman of
the NIH committee, but he warned Wednesday that blood transfusions
do carry ``documented risks of infection and immune changes.''
   He and other committee members issued a report that recommended
doctors reevaluate their use of blood transfusions during surgery
and use their ``clinical judgment'' instead of a traditional
formula to decide when transfusions are needed.
   ``Blood transfusions were once believed to be relatively safe,
but more recently many physicians and patients have come to regard
them as potentially dangerous,'' the report said.
   ``The fear of AIDS has already caused a decreased usage of
blood,'' Greenwalt told reporters. ``In my community, it is down by
7 percent.''
   But he said the transfusion of donated blood, the so-called
``homologous transfusion'', remains a ``therapeutic mainstay'' that
continues to save thousands of lives, particularly during the
emergency treatment of wounds and other injuries.
   Despite a call for caution, the committee report said that the
chances contracting AIDS is only a ``remote hazard because of donor
selection and laboratory screening procedures. It is variously
estimated that the risk of ... (AIDS) transmission by transfusion
is 1 to 40,000, to 1 to 1 million.''
   But the report warned: ``That level of risk is unlikely to be
appreciably decreased in the foreseeable future even if additional
screening tests are added.''
   Patients receiving blood transfusions are more likely to
contract hepatitis, with the risks rated as low as 1 in 100 for
some types of this viral disease, the committee report said.
   Greenwalt said the risks of disease increase with each
additional unit of donated blood used by a patient, and, as a
result, the use of such blood should be kept to a minimum.
   The committee said doctors should re-examine a basic surgical
tenent, called the ``10@30 rule,'' that has been in use for decades.
   The rule applies to the findings of blood tests given routinely
to patients before surgery. The first number refers to the numbers
of hemoglobin, or red, oxygen-carrying cells, in the blood. The
second number is the hematocrit, a measure of the percentage of
cells in the blood. Low counts, such as 10@30, indicate anemia and
lead surgeons to give transfusions routinely before surgery.
   But the committee said ``the available evidence does not support
the necessity for the 10@30 rule.'' It recommended that doctors,
instead, make specific clinical evaluations of each patient and to
use as little transfusion blood as is appropriate.
   Improved surgical procedures, along with a better understanding
of anemia, the report said, shows that patients with lower
readings, if otherwise healthy, can do well in surgery without
transfusions.
   Greenwalt said the committee also recommended that, where
possible, patients should be given their own blood during surgery.
   This can be done in two ways: Prior to surgery, patients can
give blood that is stored and then reinfused when needed. Or blood
from a sterile surgical wound can be collected, processed and
returned to the patient using equipment now on the market.
   ``Your own blood ... is always the safest to get,'' Greenwalt
said.

   The pilot of an Airbus A320 jetliner
that crashed during an air show told investigators Wednesday the
jet's instrumentation indicated he was flying at a safe altitude,
despite claims he flew too low.
   Three people were killed and 50 people were injured in the crash
of the new model jet Sunday.
   State prosecutor Jean Volff said Michel Hasseline and his
co-pilot, Pierre Mazieres, told police investigators ``the
instruments on board the plane indicated an altitude of 100 feet
above the ground at the time of passing over the aerodrome.''
   Volff told reporters preliminary investigations indicated the
jet passed at ``30 feet altitude, which is completely outside the
technical norms when it is carrying passengers.''
   According to Volff, Hasseline told investigators he realized his
altitude when his ``attention was captured by a high-tension power
line over the forest.''
   The pilot also repeated Wednesday that the ``engines responded
late'' to emergency efforts to gain altitude, Volff said.
   At the time of the accident, Bernard Labalette, an amateur pilot
who was among the 1,000 spectators at the air show, told reporters
the A320 ``was about 65 feet above the ground'' just before it
clipped some trees and crashed in a forest at the end of the runway.
   Transport Ministry officials said the flight recorder on the jet
indicated that Hasseline, a veteran pilot, was flying at only 30
feet at the time of the crash. They said that was too low to be
safe.
   Hasseline was quoted in the French press Monday as telling a
rescuer he ``wanted to increase the power, but the aircraft did not
respond.''
   Volff said no criminal charges will be brought against the pilot
and co-pilot pending outcome of the investigation.
   Transport Ministry officials in Paris defended the reliability
of the new, sophisticated jet.
   Ministry officials told reporters Monday no evidence emerged
from the preliminary accident investigation to justify removing the
plane from service.
   British Airways and Air France, each of which has two of the
completely computerized new jets, suspended flying the A320s for
one day after the accident but resumed service following the
ministry statement.
   The aircraft leasing company GATX-CL air of the United States
announced Wednesday it had ordered 10 of the A320s from the
European consortium Airbus Industrie, which makes the plane.
   Airbus spent nearly $2 billion over four years developing its
new competitor in the lucrative international commercial air market.
   The order was the first to be announced since the crash.

   The top-ranking Soviet military officer to
visit U.S. defense installations since World War II will be
accorded plenty of America's ``flavor'' but won't learn any
secrets, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday.
   ``We put (the visit) together with secrecy in mind,'' said Adm.
William Crowe, the top-ranking officer in the U.S. military. Crowe
is to welcome Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, his counterpart as
Soviet chief of staff, for talks at the Pentagon on Monday and
escort him on a tour of military bases around the country.
   The talks will continue a dialogue between the military
establishments of the superpowers. It began when Akhromeyev visited
the Pentagon during the Washington summit last December, and
continued when Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci met his Soviet
counterpart, Gen. Dmitri Yazov, last March in Switzerland and again
in Moscow during the recent summit there.
   Carlucci is scheduled to travel again to Moscow in early August,
and Crowe is to make his first trip ever to Moscow at a time yet to
be determined.
   The talks are not designed to supplement arms control
negotiations being conducted by diplomats from the two countries,
said Crowe, although he did say that he would listen if Akhromeyev
offers data on Soviet conventional forces in Europe.
   The Soviets have been pushing for an exchange of data as the
first step toward bilateral talks to reduce conventional armies in
Europe, but the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization has
said such a discussion must involve all the nations of NATO and the
Warsaw Pact.
   Akhromeyev is due to arrive in Washington next Tuesday, and to
leave the United States the following Monday after a whirlwind tour
that will include a trip to the aircraft carrier USS Theodore
Roosevelt, a speech in New York City, a peek inside the U.S. B-1
bomber and visits to Camp Lejeune, N.C., Fort Hood, Texas, and
Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D.
   Akhromeyev will also visit Crowe's alma mater, the University of
Oklahoma, and watch a rodeo in that state, Crowe said.
   ``I hope that he will go away with some flavor of our country,''
said Crowe, anticipating his role as host with relish.
   The admiral, who has a collection of dozens of hats in his
Pentagon office, admitted he would not object if the Soviet officer
brought along a new specimen to adorn the shelves.
   Akhromeyev, for his part, was expected to collect at least two
hats on his visit, a Stetson cowboy hat in Texas an Indian
headdress in Oklahoma, said Crowe.

<TEXT>
   Two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters
on a training flight collided and crashed Wednesday near this
southwestern town less than two hours after another went down in
the Black Forest, officials said.
   Police said one pilot was killed in the collision.
   A Pentagon spokesman said it was the first time F-16s had
collided and that three of the single-engine jets had been lost in
one day.
   Identities of the pilots were not released.
   The collision near Bodenheim, a town of 6,000 about six miles
south of Mainz, occurred at 1:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. EDT), said Capt.
Gail Hayes, an Air Force spokeswoman. The planes were assigned to
the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn Air Base in West Germany.
   ``There was one person aboard each aircraft. The condition of
those on board is unknown,'' Ms. Hayes said in a telephone
interview from U.S. Air Force European headquarters at Ramstein Air
Base near Kaiserslautern, about 95 miles southwest of Frankfurt.
   Hugo Lenxweiler, a spokesman for West German police, said by
telephone that one pilot was killed.
   ``The other pilot was able to eject safely'' but it was not
known whether he was injured, Lenxweiler said from his office in
Bingen, about 30 miles west of Frankfurt. He said both planes
crashed several hundred yards from a populated area.
   Preliminary information indicated one F-16 rammed the other from
behind and exploded, the police spokesman said.
   The ZDF television network showed videotape of the wreckage
burning in a field just outside Bodenheim. Debris was scattered
over a wide area and the smoking tail of one jet sat upright in the
field.
   It also showed the intact ejection seat used by the surviving
pilot. Police said no one on the ground was hurt.
   In the first accident, an Air Force F-16 crashed in the Black
Forest south of Karlsruhe at about noon. The pilot ejected safely
and was taken to Ramstein Air Base for medical evaluation, Air
Force officials said.
   The identities of the pilots were not immediately released.
   Teams of military investigators would examine the wreckage and
determine the cause of both accidents, Capt. Hayes said.
   Capt. Matt Durham, an Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon, said:
``We've never had three go down in one day. There haven't been any
mid-air collisions with F-16s.''
   Durham reported 17 Class A accidents involving F-16s this year
compared with 12 in all of 1987. Those are accidents in which there
is either a fatality or damage to aircraft exceeding $500,000.
   Even with Wednesday's accidents, ``the F-16 is still the safest
single-engine aircraft in U.S. Air Force history,'' he said.
   Two other other Air Force F-16s have crashed in West Germany
this year.
   One went down April 18 near an ammunition depot and hospital
south of Trier near the Luxembourg border. The pilot was slightly
injured when he ejected.
   On March 31, an F-16 crashed into the town of Forst north of
Karlsruhe, killing the pilot and a resident.
   The F-16, nicknamed the Fighting Falcon, is made by General
Dynamics and can fly twice the speed of sound. The $13.5 million
aircraft became operational with the U.S. Air Force in 1979 and is
considered one of the most popular jet fighters in the world based
on exports,
   More than 940 are in service with the Air Force and it still
buys the plane.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization's
ambassador to the U.N. hailed as a victory for international law a
federal court ruling issued Wednesday that permits the PLO to keep
its mission in New York.
   ``The United Nations now has no fear that the host country, or
any host country, can violate its legal obligations and get out
scot-free,'' Zehdi Labib Terzi told The Associated Press.
   U.S. District Judge Edmund Palmieri ruled that the
Anti-Terrorism Act passed by Congress does not supersede U.S.
obligations under its 1947 Headquarters Agreement with the United
Nations.
   Palmieri also said the language and legislative history of the
Anti-Terrorism Act, which branded the PLO a terrorist group, do not
indicate Congress meant to abandon America's obligations under the
Headquarters Agreement with the United Nations.
   The U.S. Mission to the United Nations said it would have no
comment on the ruling.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he was
``gratified by this judgment, which demonstrates the respect of the
U.S. courts for the international obligations of the country.''
   Terzi said the ruling is ``a great relief, because to add insult
to injury by the United States and have those injuries coming from
the judiciary would be very damaging.
   ``But now that the judiciary ... has come out with an opinion
which is supportive of international legal minds, including the
International Court of Justice, we are satisfied.''
   In April, the International Court of Justice at The Hague,
commonly known as the World Court, decreed that the United States
is obligated under the 1947 Headquarters Agreement to submit the
dispute to arbitration.
   The court has no enforcement power over its rulings.
   Dr. Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League's permanent observer to the
United Nations, said: ``We welcome the decision of the judge. We
consider it to show the integrity of the judicial system.
   ``The judgment goes to show respect for the Headquarters
Agreement and we consider this to be a victory for the United
States (judicial system) over the recklessness of the Israeli lobby
and their unquestioning supporters,'' said Maksoud in a telephone
interview from Washington.
   ``We welcome this decision and believe that this will facilitate
the work of the U.N. (General) Assembly,'' he said. ``It shows
judicial respect for United States' treaty obligations and the
healthy independence of the judiciary.''

<NOTE>EDs: New grafs 3-5 with Dukakis response</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan plunged into the 1988 White House
campaign on Wednesday, attacking Michael Dukakis as a liberal bent
on ``worn-out policies'' of tax raises and runaway government
spending.
   ``Should we expect that if the Democrats' all-but-certain
presidential candidate is elected that he would raise taxes? In
fact, he just did,'' Reagan said, mocking the recent cigarette tax
Dukakis signed in an effort to head off a state budget deficit.
   Dukakis, told of Reagan's remarks, told reporters: ``With all
due respect, I think the president's confused.''
   He defended his own economic record, contrasting it with that of
the administration.
   ``The next president will inherit a fiscal mess _ I think we all
know that...And one of my jobs as president of the United States
will be to straighten out this mess,'' said Dukakis.
   Reagan, in an address prepared for a Florida GOP fund-raising
event in support of Rep. Connie Mack III's Senate bid, fired his
harshest barrage yet at Vice President George Bush's likely
opponent. The speech marked his first political foray outside the
capital this campaign season.
   The president said of Dukakis, ``Not only has he hiked taxes as
governor of Massachusetts, but in the last five years he has
increased Massachusetts' state spending at double the rate of
federal spending.''
   Dukakis ``has spent every dime and more of the revenue generated
in his state by the Reagan-Bush recovery,'' Reagan said. ``So yes,
the man expected to head up the Democratic ticket ... is a true
liberal who, instead of controlling government spending, raises
taxes.''
   The Dukakis campaign was quick to fire back.
   ``There he goes again,'' said campaign spokesman Mark Gearan.
``The fact of the matter is that the Massachusetts budget will be
balanced and that tough choices on spending have been made,
something that we have seen nothing of during the past eight
years.''
   ``This administration has piled up more red ink than the
presidencies of George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined,''
Gearan said. ``Michael Dukakis has balanced nine and soon to be 10
budgets, a track record that should be the envy of this
administration.''
   Reagan appeared to relish his role as a surrogate for Bush. In
addition to his clear effort to debunk the ``Massachussets
miracle'' of economic recovery Dukakis has touted, the president
also seemed intent on raising the tax-hike issue, which helped foil
Walter Mondale's bid for the White House in 1984.
   Hitting at critics who have attacked his own record on federal
deficits, which reached record levels during his administration,
Reagan asserted that when liberals talk about reducing the deficit,
``it's just a code word for boosting taxes. And once they raise
taxes, they raise spending even more.''
   The president boasted about the nation's robust economy and
said, ``What the 1988 elections are all about is whether we
continue to build on that progress and move ahead to an even
brighter future or whether we hesitate and return to those worn-out
policies that bring high taxes, low-growth and a loss of direction
and purpose.''
   Reagan also lashed out at another prominent Democrat _ and
favorite target _ Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, charging that
the senator's health care proposals amount to disguised taxes on
corporations.
   ``Sen. Kennedy has tried for years to pass an exorbitantly
expensive program of socialized medicine,'' Reagan charged, adding,
``It hasn't happened, so he is proposing _ and the expected
Democratic nominee has endorsed this plan _ that the government
pass a law requiring private companies to directly pay for a
federally mandated health insurance program.''
   ``What is euphemistically called government-corporate
partnership is just government coercion, political favoritism,
collectivist industrial policy and old-fashioned federal
boondoggles nicely wrapped up in a bright colored ribbon _ and it
doesn't work,'' Reagan said.
   ``Yes, soaring prices and a sinking economy _ that's what the
other fellows with all their lip service about compassion'' have
inflicted and have in store for the American people, Reagan
asserted.
   Reagan, who met privately with a group of some 30
Cuban-Americans before his address, also tried to reassure them
that his administration was not warming up to Fidel Castro, terming
Cuba ``an inhuman Communist dungeon.''
   Although Reagan's support has been strong in the Cuban-American
community here, some leaders have argued that he is softening his
anti-Castro stand by negotiating with Cuba on immigration, human
rights and the issue of Cuban troops in Angola.
   ``There is an unbridgeable gulf between the governments of the
United States and Cuba; it is the gulf between freedom and
tyranny,'' Reagan said.
   In his address, Reagan also offered a renewed plea for aid to
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   ``Connie Mack and I stand with the Nicaraguan resistance; we
will not rest until we have won for them the full support they need
_ and until they have won for themselves the genuine democracy and
freedom for which they have so bravely struggled.''
   En route to Miami aboard Air Force One, Reagan spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said the White House has no package prepared for
congressional consideration on renewing aid to the rebels.
   ``We're waiting for (Secretary of State George) Shultz to
return,'' Fitzwater said. Shultz left Wednesday on a three-day
swing through Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras on a
trip billed by the administration as an attempt to reinforce U.S.
support for the Central American democracies.
   Reagan's appearance in Florida put him in the middle of a
Republican primary fight. Mack, the conservative third-term
congressman, is seeking the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Lawton
Chiles.
   The president accepted the speaking date weeks ago. Then, on
Monday, U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who successfully prosecuted a
major Colombian-drug case, launched his own bid.

<HEAD>Parliament Holds Unusual Debate On Multiple Candidates For Office</HEAD>

   Liberal members questioned the practice
of automatically approving Communist Party choices for the
parliament leadership, prompting unusually spirited debate in
Wednesday's session.
   A scheduled report by the head of the foreign relations
committee was postponed at a time of conflict between the two
Soviet bloc allies over Romania's treatment of its ethnic Hungarian
minority.
   On Tuesday, Romania closed the Hungarian consulate in the
Transylvanian city of Cluj-Napoca and ordered its staff out of the
country.
   Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi said he would have no comment
until later in the week.
   The Parliament, expected to discuss economic reform and make
significant changes in the government, began meeting for the first
time Wednesday under new Premier Karoly Grosz. He led a new
generation of Communist leaders into power during a national party
conference last month.
   Parliament members elected Bruno F. Straub, 74, as the nation's
president, a largely ceremonial post. Straub, the first president
who is not a party member, was nominated the party's Central
Committee last week.
   Istvan Stadinger, party candidate for speaker, was voted in
after Zoltan Kiraly, one of the most liberal legislators, started a
debate by saying there should be more than one candidate.
   Kiraly was expelled from the party in April, apparently for his
associations with independent reformers. He proposed that a
parliamentary group of party and non-party members discuss the
quesion multiple nominations.
   Another deputy, Csaba Csangradi, said votes by secret ballot
were not enough and ``the practice of democracy requires
alternatives.''
   He proposed the mayor of Budapest, Pal Ivanyi, as an alternate
candidate for speaker but other deputies objected because Ivanyi is
not a parliament member.
   Two legislators who were proposed as alternative candidates
declined. Peter Horn and Istvan Gajdos apparently feared they would
be disciplined by the party.
   Kiraly suggested the fall session discuss the issue. The debate
ended when, with only 17 negative votes and 16 abstentions, the
members decided to vote on Standiger and the deputy speaker as
planned, with a secret ballot.
   Standiger was elected by a vote of 222 in favor and an unusually
high 129 against, with three abstentions.
   The membership also approved the appointment of leading reformer
Imre Pozsgay to the newly created office of minister of state.
Pozsgay said one of his main goals would be to build cooperation
and confidence between the government and legislature.
   Also Wednesday, parliament was presented with a petition for an
alternative to military service, according to reports from
dissidents and the official news agency MTI.
   The East-West Dialogue Network, an independent group, collected
at least 790 signatures demanding civilian service for
conscientious objectors, the reports said. Most conscientious
objectors now are imprisoned.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The car-bomb killing of a U.S. defense
attache here has again focused attention on Greece's elusive
terrorist group November 17.
   The left-wing group has claimed responsibility for 12 political
assassinations in 13 years, including those of three American
diplomats. Not one of its members has ever been arrested.
   In a country where there is little violent crime, November 17
has gained notoriety for its bold attacks, some in daylight in the
center of Athens.
   Besides U.S. diplomats and servicemen, its targets have included
four Greek police officers, a conservative newspaper publisher and
two prominent industrialists.
   The conservative opposition has claimed that Premier Andreas
Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) has link with
terrorists, making the government reluctant to crack down on local
extremists.
   ``The suspicion that PASOK members' relations with terrorists of
every kind prevent the state from taking action is constantly being
reinforced,'' said the conservative New Democracy Party after
November 17 claimed responsibility for killing Greek industrialist
Alexandros Athanassides in March.
   U.S. Navy Capt. William E. Nordeen, 51, died Tuesday when a
parked car containing more than 88 pounds of high explosives blew
up next to his armor-plated vehicle near his home in Athens'
Kifissia suburb.
   Police said the bomb was set off by a remote-control device and
called it the most sophisticated attack yet staged by November 17.
   As is its custom, the group took responsibility in a lengthy
statement sent to a left-wing Athens daily. A senior police
officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the statement was
hammered out on the same typewriter used for previous proclamations
by the group.
   The statement called for Greece to pull out of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and shut down four U.S. military bases
here. It said it would keep targeting Americans ``until the last
American soldier leaves Greece.''
   November 17 is named for the date in 1973 that the right-wing
military dictatorship then in power crushed a student rebellion at
Athens Polytechnic University.
   The organization's anti-American profile reflects a belief still
held by many Greeks that U.S. tolerance of the military regime
enabled it to stay in power from 1967-74.
   Greeks also blame the United States for failing to prevent the
1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus after a coup there inspired by the
Athens junta.
   Speculation has been widespread among conservative politicans
and newspapers that November 17 may have links with socialists who
belonged to the Panhellenic Liberation Movement.
   Papandreou founded Panhellenic Liberation, a resistance
organization, when he was living in exile in Sweden during military
rule in Greece. He returned to Greece in 1974. Several of the
resistance group's members, including high ranking officials in the
present government, reportedly trained in Palestinian camps in the
early 1970s.
   In the past, the Papandreou government has been sharply
criticized by the United States for being lax in fighting
terrorism. But Greece is now anxious to shake that image, and
Deputy Premier Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas on Tuesday pledged ``tough
and unrelenting measures'' against terrorist activity.
   It is not known whether November 17 has any links with foreign
terror groups, but in the past police have speculated the group
might have had contacts with Italy's Red Brigade and the France's
Direct Action.
   Tuesday's car-bomb attack triggered speculation among Western
diplomats that the group had been in touch with international
terror groups skilled in such techniques. November 17 used to
specialize in attacks by gunmen on motorbikes, using a .45 caliber
pistol in their attacks.
   Athens CIA station chief Richard Welch in 1975 and U.S. Navy
Capt. George Tsantes in 1983 were killed with the same .45 weapon,
according to police ballistics experts.
   In the past, senior Greek police officers said they ``had a
fingerhold'' on members of November 17.
   But the closest they seem to have come was the October 1986
discovery of a cache of weapons in the home of left-winger Michael
Prekas. Prekas was killed in a shoot-out with police and the
investigation apparently reached another dead end.

<TEXT>
   A judge fined The Citadel $1,000
Wednesday for violating a gag order during the trial of an injured
football player's $16.5 million suit against the military college.
   Circuit Judge John Hamilton Smith ruled the college had
willfully disobeyed the gag order he issued in March requiring that
parties to the suit ``make no purposeful dissemination'' of
information about the case.
   Meanwhile, Bill Holthouser, the former linebacker coach at the
military school, denied in testimony Wednesday he pressured the
injured student, Marc Buoniconti, to play against East Tennessee
State during the 1985 season.
   Buoniconti, the son of former Miami Dolphins star Nick
Buoniconti, was the starting middle linebacker for The Citadel when
he suffered a broken neck while making a tackle in that game. He
was left a quadriplegic.
   Citadel public relations director Ben Legare admitted he was
aware of the gag order when he approached The News and Courier and
suggested the Charleston newspaper run a previously published
column about the case.
   The column by a Miami sportswriter was syndicated by the Knight
Ridder newspaper chain and appeared in the June 19 edition of The
(Columbia) State.
   ``I had no input into the creation of that story,'' Legare said,
adding, ``In my opinion it was a public domain story.''
   He said the column brought out ``points that had not been
brought out before.'' The trial opened June 13; the defense began
its case Monday.
   Citadel attorney Dawes Cooke said Legare did not view his
actions as dissemination of information by The Citadel itself and
said the intent was not to influence the jury.
   But Smith noted that it was The Citadel that initially requested
the gag order. He fined the school $5,000, but when he returned to
court in the afternoon he said that upon reflection he decided to
reduce the fine.
   The column quotes a University of Miami official as saying
Buoniconti speared an opposing player in the tackle that left him
paralyzed. Spearing is hitting head first rather than with the
shoulder; it is illegal under football rules.
   That has been the defense's contention in the suit against The
Citadel, the team's trainer and doctor.
   Buoniconti alleges the defendants were negligent in treating a
neck sprain he suffered several weeks earlier. The suit also
charges they failed to warn him a congenital neck condition made it
dangerous for him to continue playing football.
   Holthouser, now defensive coordinator at Virginia Military
Institute, testified Wednesday that he put no pressure on
Buoniconti to play. ``I did not have a conversation in which I said
we need you to play to win,'' he said.
   He added Buoniconti seemed normal in warmups before the game,
did not complain about pain or say special equipment to protect his
neck didn't feel right.

   Vice President George Bush declared
Wednesday ``the cold war is not over'' between Washington and
Moscow, but said sweeping changes proposed in the Soviet Union by
Mikhail S. Gorbachev sound ``revolutionary.''
   Bush, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee,
credited the Reagan administration's $1 trillion military buildup
with helping push the Soviets toward democracy and openness.
   And, in a speech, he said he hoped the investigation of fraud,
bribery and corruption in the Pentagon procurement process would
not undermine the consensus for military strength or provoke an
over-reaction.
   ``The first reaction in Congress to the scandals _ to increase
the regulatory bureaucracy at Defense _ though understandable,
that's only going to add to the complexity and worsen the problem.
   ``The answer is to reduce, cut and simplify, including staff and
executive overhead,'' Bush said, adding that Congress and the White
House should agree ``to take the patronage and pork out of
defense.''
   Bush spoke before the World Affairs Council, a foreign policy
group, at the conclusion of a 24-hour visit to northern California,
where he spent most of his time at private fund-raisers for
Republicans.
   On his return to Washington on Air Force Two, Bush attacked
Dukakis' policy on strategic nuclear weapons.
   Dukakis has voiced opposition to the MX missile and Midgetman
missiles, and also has said he would replace the administration's
Strategic Defense Initiative with a buildup in conventional forces.
   ``He wants to do away with a lot of these systems and I think to
negotiate an arms control agreement with the Soviet Union, it would
be ridiculous to do that,'' Bush said.
   The vice president said it was the United States' refusal to
make unilateral concessions on arms that persuaded the Soviets to
sign an agreement to abolish U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range
nuclear missiles.
   En route home, the vice president stopped in Appleton, Wis., and
then drove nearly 50 minutes to the farming community of Marion to
watch a cattle auction and talk about the drought.
   Standing at the auctioneer's podium amid the mooing of cows,
Bush said, ``I want to say that, leave aside the politics of the
moment and my ambitions for the fall _ what we want to do as a part
of the administration is do as much as possible under the
circumstances.''
   Upward of three-quarters of an inch of rain fell on the parched
area Tuesday, and Bush said, ``I just hope we get more rain. I hope
that will save some of the corn crop we passed by and may take a
little of the pressure off the families.''
   Bush's speech earlier followed by one day an address in Moscow
by Gorbachev to an extraordinary party council in which the Soviet
leader proposed creation of a powerful new post of president and a
partial transfer of power away from the Communist Party.
   ``Some of the dramatic reforms that General Secretary Gorbachev
proposed just yesterday would truly if implemented be revolutionary
and should the reforms ... be put into practice it would represent
historic change,'' he said. The vice president said that such moves
should be watched with ``guarded optimism.''
   However, Bush said, ``We've got to remember the cold war is not
over. We must be bold enough to seize the opportunity of change,
but at the same time, as one pundit titled his column, be prepared
for `the protracted conflict.'''
   He said the changes of glasnost, or openness, and perestroika,
or restructuring of the Soviet economic system, ``didn't take place
in a vacuum but in the context of reinvigorated American strength.''
   Bush added, ``My point is this _ it was eight years of American
strength that confronted the Soviet Union with the true costs of
aggression and necessity of reform.''
   He called Reagan's recent summit in Moscow with Gorbachev the
result of eight years ``of moral determination and hard work
rebuilding America's strength, its might.''
   Highlighting his concern about the alleged corruption in the
Pentagon purchasing system, Bush said, ``The greatest tragedy out
of all of this would be if the conduct of a few individuals were to
be used to undermine the consensus on rebuilding America's
strength.''
   He spoke warmly of reforms proposed several years ago by a
presidential commission headed by David Packard for changes in the
procurement process. He said the panel concluded that far more
defense money is lost because of the bureaucracy than because of
fraud and corruption.
   ``Even if every one of Dave Packard's recommendations were
implemented tomorrow, it would not eliminate human greed,'' Bush
said. ``That is why we must be constantly vigilant, bring in the
best people and hold them to the highest standards.''
   In raising the subject, Bush said the alleged scandal involved
Congress, the Pentagon and the defense industry. ``If the news
stories are true, the accused have done more than steal from the
public treasury. They have undermined America's security and broken
faith with the honest American people,'' the vice president said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Permits Fee Hike For Small Planes At Logan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday ruled that dramatic
increases in landing fees for small aircraft at Logan International
Airport are not discriminatory and can be implemented as planned on
Friday.
   The Massachusetts Port Authority, the independent agency that
runs the airport, had announced the new fees in March to reduce
airport congestion by encouraging small planes to use suburban
airfields.
   ``The objectives of the airport to reduce delays are rationally
related to government interests,'' U.S. District Judge A. David
Mazzone said. ``I cannot say that the assignment (of the fees) was
an arbitrary, irrational, non-uniform assignment.''
   Lawyers representing owners of small aircraft and commuter
airlines said they had not decided whether to appeal.
   The New England Legal Foundation, a non-profit organization
specializing in government regulation of business, had argued that
the fee increase violates laws requiring equal access to federally
supported airports. They also alleged the fees violate
constitutional guarantees against discrimination.
   Wayne Henderson, a lawyer for the foundation, said he was
``obviously disappointed ... but it's a close call as the judge
said.''
   The fees are based on a combination of airplanes' weight and
other operating costs. While fees for large jets actually would go
down, fliers of smaller aircraft would pay as much as 250 percent
more.
   Under the new fees, all planes at Logan will be assessed an $88
flat fee and 47 cents per 1,000 pounds. Currently, planes are
assessed $1.31 per 1,000 pounds or $25, whichever is greater. Most
small planes pay $25.
   The fee for a Boeing 747 would drop to $408 from $680, while a
Cessna 402 seating 10 passengers will pay $96 compared to the
current $25.
   The legal foundation represented commuter airlines in the New
England area. Also appearing in court were lawyers for the National
Business Aircraft Association and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association.
   The landing fees were approved after a crowded, highly charged
hearing. Among those applauding the increase were residents living
next to the airport, who see it as a way to reduce noise and the
potential for accidents.
   Logan averages 90 takeoffs and landings an hour, according to
MassPort. The Federal Aviation Administration ranks Logan among the
nation's 10 most congested airports.
   MassPort executive director David Davis called the decision a
ruling of national importance. ``It's a larger victory because the
judge supported the position of the authority's right'' to set
fees, he said.
   In a related development, the U.S. House on Tuesday removed
provisions in a $10.8 billion spending package for federal
transportation that might have blocked federal aid to Logan because
of the new fees.
   Opponents of the fee hike had inserted a provision to withhold
money from Logan until the U.S. Transportation Department finishes
investigating Massport's plan and the court ruled. The DOT review
is not due until November.
   The provision was deleted after Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II,
D-Mass., complained it had no place in a spending bill. The bill
passed the House and went to the Senate. Similar provisions
blocking aid to Logan remain in the Senate version.

<HEAD>Law Being Used To Prosecute Reagan Aides Ruled Constitutional</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the
power of independent counsels to prosecute illegal acts by
high-ranking government officials, a momentous constitutional
decision and a defeat for a handful of former White House aides
such as Oliver L. North and Michael K. Deaver.
   By a 7-1 vote, the justices said a 1978 law inspired by the
Watergate scandal does not violate the Constitution's command that
the powers of the executive, legislative and judicial branches be
separate and balanced.
   The ruling clears away a potential stumbling block in the
prosecution of North, the former National Security Council aide;
John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's former national security
adviser; and two arms dealers indicted in the Iran-Contra arms and
money affair.
   It also dispels important doubts about the convictions of
Deaver, who formerly was Reagan's deputy chief of staff, and
another onetime Reagan aide, Lyn C. Nofziger.
   It also permits a special prosecutor to wrap up a lengthy
inquiry into the financial activities of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III. No criminal charges are expected in that case.
   The court announced the ruling moments before ending its 1987-88
term. In an extraordinarily busy day, the justices issued nine
decisions totaling 433 pages.
   In the other rulings, the court:
   _Made it easier, by an 8-0 vote in a case from Texas, for
workers to prove their bosses are guilty of illegal discrimination
by expanding the way employees can use statistics to prove bias.
   _Severely limited state efforts to shield young sex abuse
victims from trauma when they tesitfy at criminal trials. The 6-2
ruling in a case from Iowa jeopardizes the use of such protective
devices for witnesses as one-way screens and videotaped testimony.
   _Struck down, 4-3, an Oklahoma man's death sentence but stopped
short of deciding whether capital punishment may be used for
convicted killers who committed their crimes before reaching age 16.
   _Ruled, 5-4, that the federal government may give money to
religious Begroups to promote chastity among America's teen-agers
as long as the groups do not teach religion while using the federal
aid.
   _In a high-stakes defeat for organized labor, voted 5-3 to make
it easier for millions of non-union workers to withhold financial
support from the unions that represent them in collective
bargaining.
   _Barred states from placing strict regulations on professional,
for-profit organizations that solicit contributions for charities.
The 7-2 ruling struck down a North Carolina law as a violation of
free-speech rights.
   In the special prosecutor case, the court overturned a 2-1
federal appeals court ruling last Jan. 22 that declared the law
unconstitutional.
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court
Wednesday, said the law does not transfer presidential powers
improperly to Congress and the courts.
   ``This case does not involve an attempt by Congress to increase
its own powers at the expense of the executive branch,'' he said.
``Similarly, we do not think that the act works any judicial
usurpation of properly executive functions. Finally, we do not
think that the act impermissibly undermines the powers of the
executive branch or disrupts the proper balance between the
coordinate branches.''
   Rehnquist said the special prosecutor law is distinct from the
so-called Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law the court struck down
in 1986 as a violation of separation of powers. That law was
invalidated for empowering a quasi-legislative officer, the
comptroller general, to establish budget cuts.
   The chief justice, in a 38-page opinion, said since special
prosecutors may be removed by the attorney general for ``good
cause,'' the executive branch maintains important control over the
independent counsels.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, the lone dissenter in his own 38-page
opinion, said the checks and balances of the Constitution are what
make it a unique and enduring document and guarantee the freedom of
the American people. ``In dictatorships of the modern world, bills
of rights are a dime a dozen,'' he said.
   The law opens the way to prosecutorial abuses by those, unlike
the president, who are not accountable to the voters, Scalia said.
   ``I fear the court has permanently encumbered the Republic with
an institution that will do it great harm,'' Scalia said.
   But James C. McKay, who prosecuted Nofziger and who is
conducting the Meese inquiry, hailed the ruling, saying in a
statement: ``This office has believed that there is an appropriate
place within the framework of the Constitution for the
establishment of a process which eliminates the inherent conflict
of interest which arises when a high official of the executive
branch is investigated by the Department of Justice.''
   ``The independent counsel statute provides a workable solution
to a difficult problem,'' the Iran-Contra prosecutor, Lawrence E.
Walsh, said in a statement.
   ``The public can now be confident that criminal wrongdoing will
get a full hearing and not be swept under the rug at the Justice
Department,'' said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, who was a member of
the congressional panels that investigated the break-in at
Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate in the
early 1970s and the Iran-Contra affair last summer.
   The Reagan administration, which helped lead the challenge to
the law, sought to minimize the importance of the ruling.
   In a statement, the White House said, ``The administration has
faithfully and consistently complied with all of the act's
requirements. Today's decision ... will have no practical effect on
the administration's implementation'' of the law.
   Meese told reporters: ``These are all tough constitutional
issues and we put up, on behalf of the administration, the best
legal arguments that we can.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the newest member of the court and
one of three justices appointed by Reagan, did not take part in the
independent prosecutor decision.
   Congress enacted the statute in the wake of the Watergate
scandal that led to President Nixon's resignation to provide an
independent mechanism for investigating alleged high-level
government wrongdoing.
   Opponents and supporters of the law, a key portion of the Ethics
in Government Act, cited the Watergate case to buttress their
position.
   The law's advocates said it was essential to assure the nation
that crimes in high places would not be covered up.
   But opponents pointed out that Nixon was forced out of office
because of public opinion and the threat of impeachment, without
any need for an independent investigation.
   The law empowers a special federal court to appoint independent
counsels at the request of the attorney general. The attorney
general first conducts a preliminary inquiry to determine whether
charges against a government official warrant appointment of the
outside counsel.
   The law was challenged by Theodore B. Olson, a former assistant
attorney general accused of lying to Congress in 1983 during a
dispute over the Environmental Protection Agency's cleanup program
for toxic waste sites.
   Alexia Morrison, a Washington lawyer, is the special prosecutor
investigating that case.
   The immediate stakes in the case involved some of the most
prominent figures of the Reagan presidency.
   Deaver, convicted of lying to a grand jury and a House
subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities, is awaiting
sentencing. Whitney North Seymour was the independent counsel who
prosecuted him.
   Nofziger was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined $30,000
for illegal lobbying.
   North was expected to go on trial in the fall in the Iran-Contra
case on charges he conspired to divert profits from the sale of
arms to Iran to the Contra rebels fighting the government in
Nicaragua.
   His co-defendants _ Poindexter, businessman Albert A. Hakim and
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord _ are to be tried
separately.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi, claiming
control of more than one-third of Angola, appealed Wednesday for
continued U.S. aid to force Angola's communist government to deal
with his movement.
   ``Support should not be cut before we have concluded with the
MPLA (government) a deal, for negotiations, formation of a
government of national unity and elections,'' Savimbi told a forum
on southern Africa.
   The bearded guerrilla fighter takes his message to the White
House Thursday, where he has an appointment with President Reagan.
He met Secretary of State George Shultz on Tuesday and has been
talking to members of Congress and private groups during an
extended visit to the United States.
   Savimbi has been lobbying against views of some Democrats who
favor restoring the ban lifted two years ago against aid to his
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA, and
of U.S. civil rights advocates troubled by UNITA's acceptance of
arms from white-ruled South Africa.
   Savimbi's proposals for national reconciliation were sharply
opposed here this week by an Angolan MPLA government delegation
that discussed with Reagan administration officials the ongoing
negotiations about the removal of Cuban forces from Angola.
   The Angolan officials rejected talks with UNITA or elections,
repeated demands for the guerrillas to lay down their arms and
branded them ``ancillary forces of South Africa.''
   Declaring he is against apartheid, the South African system of
racial segregation, Savimbi said UNITA has always ``accepted
support from wherever we get it'' _ earlier in the independence
struggle against Portugal, and now against the Marxist government
and its supporting Cuban, Soviet, East German and North Korean
forces.
   ``No one is saying that Churchill or Roosevelt by supporting
Stalin were communists,'' he added, referring to the allied
British, American and Soviet leaders during World War II.
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador at the United Nations,
introduced Savimbi to the forum sponsored by the American
Enterprise Institute, a private business-sponsored, conservative
policy group as ``one of the authentic heroes of our time, a poet,
revolutionary, theoretician and survivor.''
   Savimbi said 12,000 more Cuban troops entered Angola the past
two months, raising the total to 57,000, which is about 25 percent
over U.S. estimates.
   Except for increased Cuban strength, ``the situation has turned
very favorable'' for UNITA, Savimbi said, with the Cubans moving
from Northern to Southern Angola. This has ``given us the intiative
in the North, we are closer to the capital and MPLA is feeling much
more pressure than ever before,'' he said.
   ``U.S. support has made a tremendous difference, we have
neutralized Cuban and MPLA air power, and we got a very powerful
transmitter which is allowing us to pass our message to the whole
nation.''
   U.S. aid to UNITA since the ban was lifted is classified but has
been unofficially estimated at about $16 million a year.

   Israeli troops killed a 15-year-old Palestinian
boy Wednesday and police fired tear gas at Arab schoolgirls
protesting peacefully outside the U.S. Consulate in Arab east
Jerusalem, witnesses said.
   In a third incident, troops shot and wounded two young Arabs
near the open-air market in the West Bank city of Nablus, hospital
officials said.
   The army confirmed one Palestinian was wounded there Wednesday
and said it was checking the report of a second shooting.
   The Palestinian boy who died, Ibrahim Ghassan Aranka, was shot
during a clash in the Arab village of Taiyiba, near Ramallah in the
West Bank, said officials at Jerusalem's Mukassad Hospital.
   The fatality brought to 212 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which Israel captured from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war. Four Israelis also have died in the violence.
   Salem Suleiman Khoriyeh, 42, the son of the village elder, told
The Associated Press that villagers spotted a Jewish settler
setting fire to olive trees near Taiyiba Wednesday.
   He said hundreds of villagers rushed to the grove and battled
the blaze, which destroyed about 15 acres of olive trees.
   Soldiers in five jeeps watched but did not help, Khoriyeh said.
   Angered by the indifference, villagers began stoning the
soldiers, who responded by opening fire, Khoriyeh said. He said
Aranka was shot from a distance of about 150 feet.
   An army spokesman said an officer opened fire in Taiyiba after
his unit was pelted with stones and bottles and that two soldiers
were slightly injured. He said the army was investigating whether
Aranka was killed by army gunfire.
   The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said he could not
immediately confirm villagers' claims about a Jewish settler's
arson.
   The protest near the U.S. Consulate involved about 75 girls,
most of them 13 to 14 years old, who were holding up handwritten
signs saying: ``Please Open Our Schools,'' said the U.S. official,
who spoke on condition his name not be used.
   He said American officials had requested that tear gas not be
used. He said the United States would raise the incident with
Israel.
   The official said about 30 police officers hurled tear gas after
the schoolgirls left the consulate parking lot and the half-hour
demonstration appeared to be breaking up. He said the girls did not
throw stones.
   The girls were seen fleeing the gas, many of them coughing and
covering their faces with their hands.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Rafi Levy put the number of
demonstrators at 200 and said tear gas was used only after the
students were warned to disperse.
   Levy said several Arab girls were arrested outside a school in
east Jerusalem for allegedly trying to incite fellow students to
protest. Israel radio said seven were arrested.
   Israeli officials have closed 34 schools in Arab east Jerusalem
and the West Bank, contending schools are a central source of
anti-Israeli protests.
   The radio also quoted the head of Israel's military
intelligence, Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahad, as saying that although the
Arab uprising spawned a new local leadership in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, Palestinians still accept the Palestine Liberation
Organization as their undisputed leader.
   Shahad's statement marked a rare Israeli acknowledgement of PLO
influence in the occupied territories.
   Hospital officials said Wednesday's clash in Nablus began when
youths threw bottles and rocks at troops accompanying Israeli tax
officials who were checking Arab shops.
   Soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets and then fired live
ammunition, seriously wounding a 17-year-old in the stomach and a
22-year-old in the right arm, the hospital officials said.
   In Hebron, on the West Bank, a military spokesman said the army
arrested members of a guerrilla cell believed responsible for
stabbing a Jewish settler last Friday and other attacks.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman in Washington
denied on Wednesday a report from Israel that U.S. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz might make another trip to the Middle East
in July to seek a peace agreement.
   Redman said Shultz was not ruling out another visit to the
region later this year, but not in the time period mentioned.

<HEAD>Investigators Look for Clues to Why Train Lost Brakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators searched for clues Wednesday to why a
train lost its brakes and ended its journey in a disastrous
collision at a Paris station that killed nearly 60 people.
   Police said dismembered bodies had caused confusion in
establishing a death toll in the accident, which occurred Monday,
and it probably was 56 rather than the 59 announced earlier. Of 38
people injured, 13 still were hospitalized.
   All the 55 dead identified by Wednesday were French.
   The runaway commuter train careened into the busy Gare de Lyon
station at 7:10 p.m. Monday and hit a full train waiting to depart.
   Most of the victims apparently were in the stationary train.
Witnesses said most passengers had left the incoming train at an
unscheduled 26-minute stop.
   Three separate investigations are being conducted, by police,
the state-run railway company and the Transport Ministry.
   Officials of the rail company said Tuesday the veteran engineer
on the runaway train realized more than a mile from the Gare de
Lyon that his brakes were gone and warned passengers to move to the
back of the train.
   They also said the engineer, Daniel Saulin, 42, first realized
there was a brake problem after the eight-car train had been
stopped five miles from the station by a passenger who pulled the
emergency cord.
   Louis Lecor, a company spokesman, said authorities had not yet
identified the passenger who committed the ``act of malicious
mischief.''
   Saulin had problems resetting the brakes and the train did not
move for 26 minutes, the company said. Most passengers boarded
another Paris-bound train that passed, the French press quoted
witnesses as saying.
   About a mile from the Paris station, when Saulin realized he had
no brakes, he alerted the station controller and then his
passengers. His train sped into the Gare de Lyon at 40-50 mph,
through a stop signal 600 yards from impact.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse said investigators
were questioning both Saulin and the controller and listening to
``black boxes'' containing technical information on train movements.
   Quoting ``well informed sources,'' it said there was a conflict
in the accounts of the engineer and station controller. According
to the agency report, Saulin said the controller told him to
proceed despite brake problems but company policy is that such a
decision rests with the engineer.

<HEAD>Nine Officers Sentenced In January Rebellion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military court sentenced nine
army lieutenants Wednesday to jail sentences ranging up to 90 days
for their roles in a January mutiiny, the government said.
   They were among several hundred officers and non-commissioned
officers who sided with former Lt. Col. Aldo Rico in the brief
rebellion involving the Monte Caseros Infantry Regiment in
northeastern Corrientes Province and five other army camps.
   It was one of the most serious threats to the civilian
government government of President Raul Alfonsin since it replaced
a military dictatorship in December 1983.
   The rebellion ended Jan. 18 with the surrender of 328 officers
and non-commissioned officers. Three loyalist soldiers were wounded
by a mine explosion.
   Rico and his followers were protesting the trials of military
officers accused of human rights violations under military juntas
that ruled from 1976 to 1983.
   He contended the military should have been thanked for winning
the ``dirty war'' on leftist subversion, in which a government
panel says at least 9,000 people disappeared and are presumed dead.
Human rights groups 30,000 is a more accurate figure.
   About 60 officers, including Rico, are being held pending trial
in a military jail in Magdalena, 60 miles southeast of Buenos Aires.
   Rico, 44, led a similar revolt in three army camps in April
1987. He faces a possible 25 years to life in prison.
   The nine men sentenced Wednesday have been under arrest since
January. In ordering sentences of 30-90 days, the army's Permanent
War Council recognized the time served.
   The detainees were returned to their original camp in the
southern province of Chubut, close to the Chilean border.

   A district judge blocked the Union Carbide
Corp. on Wednesday from settling directly with victims of the
Bhopal gas leak, the world's worst industrial disaster.
   Judge M.W. Deo issued an interim injunction against direct
settlement in response to a June 16 request by the Indian
government, which has made itself sole legal representative of
victims of the Dec. 3, 1984, gas leak.
   Nearly 3,000 people were killed and more than 20,000 seriously
injured in the leak at a Bhopal pesticide plant owned by an Indian
subsidiary of Union Carbide, which is based in Danbury, Conn.
   The company says the leak was caused by employee sabotage. India
says poor maintenance and low safety standards were to blame.
   India filed a $3 billion suit against Union Carbide that is
still being heard.
   ``It's disturbing that the Indian government, which claims to be
the sole representative of Bhopal victims, continues to prevent
those victims from resolving their own claims expeditiously and to
their own satisfaction,'' the company said Wednesday in a statement
released at its headquarters.
   Union Carbide, saying there was ``no political will'' in the New
Delhi government to settle, began dealing directly with lawyers who
filed suit in the United States on behalf of gas claimants.
   Nearly 150,000 claimants are represented by lawyers seeking
damages in courts in Connecticut and Texas. The Indian government
has received claims from about 500,000 people.
   Deo said his order was not to stop proceedings but only to block
a settlement in the United States before he gives his final
judgment on July 29.
   Union Carbide argued that any injunction would be an affront to
the Connecticut court that is judging the case with private lawyers
of gas victims.
   Indian government lawyers say any settlement reached in the
Connecticut court would be null and void.
   They quoted a Union Carbide spokesman as saying the company was
seeking to reach a settlement providing less than $350 million for
the victims.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Confirms Subs In Swedish Waters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unidentified Soviet government
official was quoted as saying Wednesday that Soviet submarines may
have regularly violated Swedish waters until 1985, when Mikhail S.
Gorbachev took power, but have not done so since.
   The Aftonbladet daily quoted the official as saying the Soviets
distrusted Sweden's ability to keep neutral in wartime and feared
it would be forced to help the North Atlantic alliance.
   The Soviet military wanted to chart Swedish waters and convinced
the Kremlin to go along in what was one of a series of foreign
policy errors during the regime of Leonid Brezhnev, the newspaper
quoted the official as saying.
   ``I cannot exclude that Soviet submarines operated in Swedish
waters. On the contrary, it is probable, considering our previous
foreign policy,'' he was quoted as saying in an interview in Moscow.
   According to Aftonbladet, he said ``the military could easily
convince the Soviet party leadership that this or that was
necessary. The control over the army was not so strict. Since then
it has been tightened.''
   Aftonbladet called the man an expert on Scandinavian affairs.
   It said the official reported that the Soviet violations
continued until 1985, when Gorbachev became general secretary of
the Soviet Communist Party.
   It was the closest to an admission of territorial violations
since a Soviet submarine ran aground off Karlskrona naval base in
1981. Last week, Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerassimov said reports
of continued intrusions reminded him ``of the Loch Ness story.''
   Swedish defense staff spokesman Evert Dahlen declined to comment
on the Aftonbladet story since ``we do not know who the source is.''
   But Dahlen said incursions were continuing as they have every
year this decade. Sweden has not identified the nationality of the
intruders since making a diplomatic protest to Moscow in 1983. The
Soviets rejected the accusations, and Swedish-Soviet relations were
virtually frozen until last year.
   The Soviet official was quoted as saying Soviet foreign policy
has ``changed fundamentally,'' and that he ``without doubt can say
there are no Soviet submarines in Swedish waters today.''
   ``We know that the slightest mistake or another grounding will
cause a new conflict with Sweden, and not only Sweden, there will
be an outcry all over the world,'' he was quoted as saying, adding
that a new scandal could be ``fatal to Gorbachev's new foreign
policy which is based on showing we are not aggressive.''

   The Pentagon inspector general's office has
reopened its investigation into a disputed contract in the wake of
the separate criminal investigation of bribery and fraud in Defense
Department weapons purchases, according to Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich.
   The IG probe was renewed June 16, two days after the
two-year-old criminal investigation became public when search
warrants were served on Pentagon officials, contractors, and
private consultants.
   The investigation was reopened because of the possible
involvement of Melvyn R. Paisley, a former top Navy official who
has emerged as a key figure in the bribery investigation.
   The contract in question involves a Navy radar-warning system,
said Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Dingell, in a letter Tuesday to Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci, asked for all documents relating to the decision by June
Gibbs Brown, the Pentagon inspector general, to take another look
at the case.
   Dingell's letter said Brown's office received information from a
telephone tip in which the tipster alleged that Paisley conspired
with officials of two companies to limit competition for the
AN@ALR-67 radar receiving sets. The two companies were identified
as Litton's Applied Technologies Division and Dalmo Victor, a
subsidiary of the Singer Corp.
   The Navy reportedly planned to open competition for a $121
million part of the contract to several companies, but the
unidentified tipster said Paisley ordered that a less-competitive
process known as ``leader@follower'' be used.
   That would permit Litton to remain the lead contractor and allow
it to train a second company to produce the system. The second
company would be Dalmo Victory, the tipster said.
   Litton had been the sole-source contractor for the system, which
includes a sophisticated display and warning system which tells a
Navy pilot that his plane is being tracked by enemy radars.
   Dingell's letter said the contract ``may ultimately be worth $1
billion to the recipients.''
   The tip was telephoned to the General Accounting Office, the
congressional watchdog agency, which passed it along last Aug. 27
to the Pentagon inspector general's office. The Pentagon office
investigated and told the GAO on Feb. 18 that the charges were
``unsubstantiated,'' Dingell said.
   Dingell said he wants to know ``what facts led the DoD-IG to
label the charges as `unsubstantiated.'''

   One of the first red wolves to produce
offspring since the endangered species was reintroduced to the wild
has died, and her mate apparently has taken charge of the
9-week-old pup, officials said Wednesday.
   The wolf, thought to have succumbed to disease or infection, was
discovered Saturday at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge
near Manteo, said refuge manager John Taylor.
   The pup was nowhere to be found. But two days later, a wildlife
team spotted it trotting alongside its father in the 140,000-acre
refuge, Taylor said.
   ``We are fortunate that the puppy had been weaned already,'' he
said, adding that it was unusual for male wolves to take care of
their offspring.
   He said the male wolf apparently had been feeding the puppy the
way the mother would _ by killing and eating raccoons, rabbits and
other small animals and regurgitating the soft gruel.
   ``It's cute _ it looks like a little dog puppy, only it's kind
of mottle-colored, mostly reddish with spots of gray,'' Taylor
said. ``We thought the prospects of our finding (it) alive were
slim.''
   The female wolf was among four pairs of red wolves released into
the wild in September as part of a federal effort to save the
species. The animals were declared extinct in the wild in 1980.
   The newly orphaned pup was first spotted May 21, and another pup
was sighted soon afterward with different parents _ marking the
first time a species previously extinct in the wild has produced
offspring after being returned to its natural environment.
   Although litters average five or six pups, scientists believe no
more than one survived from either of the two litters.
   The red wolf once roamed the Southeast in large numbers. But in
1978, with the species teetering near extinction, the last pure red
wolves were taken from the wild to a zoo in Tacoma, Wash. There,
breeding in captivity encouraged biologists to try reintroducing
the animals into the wild.
   At Alligator River, wildlife teams take trips into the wild
every other day to track the adult wolves via radio collars worn by
the animals, Taylor said.

   Pope John Paul II placed gold rings on the
fingers of 24 new cardinals Wednesday and told them to be
``tireless promoters and constructors of peace and harmony'' in the
church.
   He also gave a sacred vestment known as the pallium to each of
15 new archbishops, including Eugene Marino of Atlanta, the first
black Roman Catholic archbishop in the United States.
   About 20,000 people filled St. Peter's Square for the ceremony
late Wednesday afternoon, many with umbrellas to ward off the
glaring sun.
   When the new cardinals marched to the altar at the start of the
2{-hour Mass, the crowd burst into applause and waved yellow and
white handkerchiefs, the Vatican's colors.
   Among the 24 churchmen formally installed Tuesday as ``princes
of the church'' were two U.S. archbishops, James Hickey of
Washington, D.C., and Edmund Szoka of Detroit.
   The cardinals knelt one-by-one before the red-robed pontiff
Wednesday to receive the rings, a sign of their espousal to the
church.
   All the cardinals, except Anthony Padiyara of Ernakulam, India,
wore maroon robes trimmed with gold. Padiyara, a member of the
Siro-Malabaresi rite, was dressed in a glittering silver robe
decorated with bright pink.
   John Paul called on the new cardinals to emulate Saint Peter and
Saint Paul, the patron saints of Rome, whose feast day fell on
Wednesday.
   ``We expect these cardinals to be, like Peter, tireless
promoters and constructors of peace and agreement among the people
of God _ models, like Paul, of the generous and incessant
dedication to the proclamation of the Gospel in every part of the
world,'' the pontiff, speaking in Italian, said in his homily.
   Delegations from different countries applauded after the
cardinals received their rings.
   The 15 archbishops knelt before the pontiff earlier to receive
the pallium, a thin white wool band decorated with black crosses
that symbolizes union with the Holy See.
   ``Peace be with you,'' the pope told each archbishop in Latin as
he placed the pallium over his head.
   Asked what he thought about as he received the vestment, Marino
said after the Mass: ``The universality of the Church.''
   ``Having been born and raised in Biloxi, Miss., and my idea of
the church having been conditioned by being in small communities, I
suddenly found myself a bishop, then an archbishop, then here. It
was very exciting for me to kneel there,'' he said.
   Archbishop Anthony Bevilacqua of Philadelphia also received the
pallium, as did archbishops from Italy, Tanzania, the Philippines,
Ireland, Brazil, Haiti, Algeria and India.
   The rings given to the cardinals bear a gold rectangle, slightly
larger than a man's thumbnail, with a raised image of Christ on the
cross.

<HEAD>No Action Against Police Chief Over Shooting Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A watchdog panel of police and
civilians said Wednesday no disciplinary action will be taken
against Northern Ireland's police chief over allegations his force
murdered unarmed guerrilla suspects.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, called it a cover-up. The Social Democratic and
Labor Party, the province's leading Roman Catholic party, said the
chief and his deputies should resign.
   The 20-member Northern Ireland Police Authority criticized
certain police operational procedures but said no action was needed
against Sir John Hermon, chief constable of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
   Nor will his two top deputies, Deputy Chief Constable Michael
McAtamney and Assistant Chief Constable Trevor Forbes, face
disciplinary action, it said.
   It was the latest chapter in a conflict that has bedeviled the
British province since late 1982, when police killed six unarmed
Catholics, five of them acknowledged guerrillas, in three separate
incidents.
   The killings led to allegations of an illegal shoot-to-kill
policy against guerrillas fighting to rid Protestant-dominated
Northern Ireland of British rule and unite it with the
predominantly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   The panel said it based its decision on findings of an inquiry
which reported no evidence of illegalities. It said its decision
was by a majority of one, but did not give the exact vote or say
how many members voted.
   Hermon and his deputies said in a statement: ``We always knew we
had nothing to fear from any investigation. Nevertheless we are
pleased the Police Authority has vindicated our position.''
   Herman, who turns 60 in November, has said he will retire next
year.
   On Monday, the London-based human rights group Amnesty
International demanded a judicial inquiry into the killings, saying
existing procedures were inadequate for preventing illegal police
shootings.
   John Stalker, a British detective assigned to investigate the
shootings, claims he was obstructed by Hermon and eventually forced
off the case because he was close to proving murder had been
committed.
   In January, the British government announced that although there
was a police conspiracy to obstruct justice, no one would be
prosecuted.
   Stalker's inquiry was completed by another British officer,
Colin Sampson, whose report has not been published.
   But the Police Authority quoted Sampson as concluding: ``I have
found no evidence that there were instructions to any police
officers in Northern Ireland to use other than legitimate methods
to bring offenders to justice.''
   Kevin McNamara, the opposition Labor Party's Northern Ireland
spokesman, said: ``There have been two casualties: the first is
confidence in the administration of the rule of law in Northern
Ireland. The second is Britain's good name in the world.''

<HEAD>Teamsters' Lawyer Says New Jersey Test Case Was Failure</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Newark-Teamsters Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawyer for the Teamsters union on Wednesday
said a U.S. Justice Department plan to stop alleged Mafia influence
of the union through a court-appointed trustee is an idea that was
tried in New Jersey and failed.
   Teamsters chief counsel John Climaco, in a telephone interview
from the Ritz Carlton Hotel where the Teamsters' executive is
holding its quarterly meeting, told The Associated Press the
trustee plan was ``a very real threat.''
   But he said union leaders were ``ready to fight anything.''
   On Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani filed a racketeering
lawsuit in Manhattan federal court in what he said was an attempt
to break Mafia domination of the Teamsters.
   The government wants a federal judge to remove from office any
Teamsters officers found to have violated racketeering laws, and to
appoint a trustee who would ensure the fair election of new
officers in the 1.6-million member union.
   A test case for the move occurred in Teamsters Local 560 in
Union City, N.J., where court-appointed trustees have been in
charge since 1986.
   The second trustee appointed, former federal prosecutor Edwin
Steir, has reported some progress but also says union members are
reluctant to get involved because of past intimidation.
   ``Everyone who has been connected with 560 has said it's a
failure, including the first trustee,'' Climaco said.
   He said the union executive will conclude its meeting behind
closed doors Thursday but may not immediately reveal its plans
against the federal lawsuit.
   The lawsuit named all 18 members of the union's executive board,
including the Canadian representative, Edward Lawson, 59, of
Vancouver, a member of Canada's appointed Senate. It also named 26
alleged members or associates of the Mafia, 25 of whom already have
been convicted of extortion, embezzlement and other crimes.
   Lawson was angered by the sweeping nature of the suit, noting
the specific allegations involve only six U.S. locals out of 620
and no charges against the union in Canada.
   He claimed the suit was aimed at taking the heat off a
scandal-plagued Reagan administration, including allegations of
wrongdoing against Attorney General Edwin Meese and corruption at
the Pentagon.
   ``This is the most corrupt administration in the history of the
United States,'' said Lawson, head of the Teamsters in Canada and a
vice-president of the international union.
   ``They've decided they have to get all of that (scandal) out of
the news and do something like attack an easy target like the
Teamsters.''
   He said it was not clear if the suit was aimed at appointing a
trustee for union elections in Canada.
   ``Whether they have the right to extend their tentacles into
Canada is a very serious question,'' Lawson said. ``We're going to
defend this vigorously. They're going to find that the Teamsters
are not so easy a mark.''

<HEAD>Premier Says Wealth Tax Not Meant As Revenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Socialist Premier Michel Rocard said Wednesday his
new government's proposal to re-establish a wealth tax was intended
to knit society together, not to soak the wealthy.
   ``The wealth tax is a contribution to solidarity, not a revenge
against the rich,'' Rocard told the National Assembly in a speech
describing the outlines of his government's policies.
   Rocard, appointed premier just after the May 8 re-election of
Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, named an expanded
49-member Cabinet on Tuesday with Socialists in all key positions
but with several more centrist or non-political figures in
ministerial posts.
   The Socialists have just 277 seats in the 577-member assembly,
and so will need support from Communist or center-right deputies to
pass legislation.
   But Rocard's minority government should be in no immediate
danger of falling. He is under no obligation to call a vote of
confidence, either on his statement of general policy or on other
issues.
   In his speech, the premier did not provide any specifics of the
planned wealth tax, which will replace a levy imposed by the
Socialists after their election in 1981 and repealed by the
conservatives under Premier Jacques Chirac in 1986.
   Rocard said too high a tax on accumulated wealth would risk
accelerated capital flight at a time when France needs business
investment.
   ``On the other hand, a symbolic tax _ which would be purely
ideological _ would not produce the necessary amounts for the
solidarity desired by all,'' he said.
   The wealth tax, as Mitterrand promised in his re-election
campaign, is to provide part of the funds for a mininum guaranteed
income, the amount of which has also not been set.
   Rocard said legislation on both proposals would be adopted by
his Cabinet on July 13 and sent immediately to the assembly for
consideration.
   The premier said his government hoped to provide ``a new hope''
for France by increasing spending on research, restoring
dilapidated public housing and making education and training
priorities.
   Government agencies will be asked to improve and simplify their
service to the public, said Rocard, who promised to pay a visit
exactly a year from now to those departments that make the greatest
improvements.
   He said France would remain committed to building a united
Europe and increase its development aid gradually until it amounts
to 0.7 percent of the gross national product.

   A massive memorandum accompanying a government
suit to seize control of the Teamsters outlines hundreds of
Teamster-related prosecutions since 1970 to back up charges the
union made a ``devil's pact'' with the mob.
   The government filed suit Tuesday, seeking to oust the top
leadership of the nation's largest union.
   In support of its request, the government claimed in a detailed,
105-page document that a recent series of successful criminal and
civil prosecutions demonstrates the Mafia has gained control over
the Teamsters.
   The court papers noted that four of the last five Teamsters
presidents have faced federal felony charges and three were
convicted: David Beck for embezzlement; Jimmy Hoffa for obstructing
justice and mail fraud, and Roy Williams for trying to bribe a U.S.
senator.
   ``Since approximately 1970,'' according to the memo, ``the
government has successfully prosecuted well over 300 persons
associated with the Teamsters for Teamsters-related crimes.''
   Among 26 alleged mob figures named as defendants in the lawsuit,
25 have been convicted of Teamsters-related crimes such as
extortion through threats of union problems, embezzling union funds
and taking labor payoffs.
   From 1970 until now, the government contended, the Teamsters'
executive board ``has rarely taken disciplinary action against, or
even investigated, corrupt Teamsters officials or subordinate
entities.''
   The union leadership, the government charged, ``has made a
devil's pact with La Cosa Nostra,'' or the Mafia.
   The Teamsters' executive board, which is holding its quarterly
meeting in Montreal, criticized the lawsuit as ``a vicious
anti-labor attack'' and said allegations of ties to organized crime
were ``pure myth.''
   After the suit was filed, U.S. District Judge David Edelsten
barred the board from making large expenditures of union funds or
destroying records, and banned the 25 convicted mob defendants from
participating in union affairs.
   In announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani quoted
the President's Commission on Organized Crime's description of the
Teamsters as ``the union `most controlled' by organized crime.''

   Opposition parties argued in the legislature
Wednesday that the planned transfer of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets
to Italy from Spain would harm chances for peace.
   The government, responding to a request from the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, announced June 4 it would accept 72 F-16s that
will be expelled from the Torrejon air base near Madrid within
three years.
   NATO asked Italy to accept the warplanes, which comprise the air
force's 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, so they could remain part of
NATO strategy for the defense of southern Europe.
   The Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, opened debate on the
transfer Wednesday and is expected to vote Thursday on a motion by
four opposition parties to reject it.
   Premier Ciriaco De Mita's governing coalition holds a
comfortable majority and is expected to win parliamentary approval
for the transfer.
   The government says Italy must honor its commitments to NATO and
that Italy and the allies cannot make what would amount to a
unilateral act of disarmament.
   The United States wanted Spain to keep the planes, but after
lengthy negotiations, Spain declined to renew a base agreement.
   Italy's opposition parties argued Wednesday that accepting the
planes would alter the strategic balance between East and West and
hinder efforts to reduce tensions.
   Deputy Maria Teresa Capecchi, a Communist, said relocating the
fighter-bombers in Italy ``shapes up as dangerous act that risks
being misinterpreted by the East.''
   However, Christian Democratic Deputy Bartolo Ciccardini argued
that failure to relocate the planes in southern Europe ``would
reduce NATO's military power in the area by 30 to 50 percent.''
   The government has decided to station the American planes at a
military airport near Crotone, a city of 50,000 about 400 miles
south of Rome.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Says Tax Panel ``Rolled'' By Insurance Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee voted
Wednesday to limit the tax break for single-premium life insurance
policies, but chairman Dan Rostenkowski said his panel did not go
far enough because of industry pressure.
   The committee, meeting in closed session, approved by voice vote
an amendment offered by Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Ct., whose
Hartford district is an insurance industry stronghold, to raise
about $300 million over the next three years by shrinking the
loophole.
   Rostenkowski wanted to raise twice as much, but shrinking the
loophole still more.
   Under the 1986 tax law, the growth in value in the policies is
untaxed and the purchaser can borrow back the large single premium
interest-free, making what critics say is a tax dodge for the
wealthy who are able to afford such policies.
   Under the Kennelly version that prevailed, people who take
advantage of that mechanism would incur subsequent tax penalties if
they borrowed against policies held less than seven years.
   Rostenkowski had wanted penalties to apply if interest-free
loans were taken against a policy held less than 20 years. His plan
would have raised more than $600 million, but over his objections
the panel went with the industry-supported Kennelly plan.
   In a statement released when committee staff briefed reporters
on the session, Rostenkowski told the committee it was getting
``rolled by the insurance industry,'' and promised to fight the
issue again on a future tax bill.
   ``We're only kidding ourselves _ and the industry is completely
naive _ if they think this ... does the job,'' he said.
   Mrs. Kennelly, in a telephone interview, said she was confident
her plan would end abuses. She said the current tax bill was not
the place for a broad revamping of insurance taxes.
   ``I think what we probably did was close down the single premium
loophole,'' she said. Brokers promising a quick buck ``will be out
of business,'' she said.
   The provision was added to a grab-bag tax package which started
as a series of technical corrections to the 1986 bill, but which
also includes a wide range of other tax changes.
   About $6 billion in new taxes, mostly on corporations, have been
approved by the committee to offset tax breaks, such as repeal of
the requirement that farmers and other off-road users of diesel
fuel pay the 15.1 cent-per-gallon federal tax.
   The committee was scheduled to continue work on the bill on
Thursday.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz appealed
to New Zealand on Wednesday to reconsider its ban on visits by
nuclear warships and rejoin the three-nation alliance disbanded in
1986.
   ``It seems to us there must be a formula, if only New Zealand
would look for it, that would make it possible for them to come
back into the fold,'' Shultz said.
   ``We would hope that the New Zealanders would change their
attitude and re-enter the alliance,'' Australian Foreign Minister
Bill Hayden said.
   They made the comments at a news conference following annual
talks by the Australian and U.S. defense and foreign ministers.
   The so-called ANZUS defense alliance between the United States,
Australia and New Zealand was dissolved in a dispute over New
Zealand's ban on nuclear weapons and nuclear power and the
longstanding U.S. policy of neither confirmwith the city before the rally
and
said ``there's nothing to be optimistic about,'' but he declined to
explain why his perception differed from Sutton's viewpoint.
   ``In terms of what I have seen at the bargaining table, it looks
like a problem,'' said Cronin, who represents about 3,000 workers.
``Maybe he has seen something else.''
   Both Sutton and Cronin said they would favor of an extension of
the talks into the weekend if the deadline passes without contracts.
   Goode has said he would prefer not to extend the negotiations.
   Deputy Mayor Marjorie Adler said talks with the unions were
``making progress but moving along slowly.''
   Workers and thd
plans to eliminate about 1,700 city jobs in an effort to balance
the budget.
   Goode said the City Council's approval of $101 million in new
taxes, about $40 million short of his request, has forced him to
make cost-cutting plans for every department.
   ``He's putting the unions in the position where he's forcing a
strike,'' said Ronald Armour, a sanitation worker.
   Armour said he was doubtful an agreement could be reached before
the deadline. He said Goode's plans set a different tone for this
year's contract negotiations.
   ``This here could be the demise of our departments _ it's do or
die for us,'' Armour said.
   Other municipal workers who have been through past strikes
agreed.
   ``I think the attitude is different because the city is asking
for a lot of givebacks and the threat of layoffs is hanging over
our heads,'' said Brenda Goode, a social worker.
   Dana Bennett is another sanitation worker who remembers the last
municipal workers strike, when garbage went uncollected and
gathered in rotting piles across the city two years ago.
   ``In those 20 days, I hated it,'' Bennett said. ``I hate to
strike. I want to work, but if worse comes to worst ...''
   The arbitration hearing for the city and the union representing
Philadelphia's more than 6,000 police concluded Wednesday.
   Bob Hurst, president of Lodge 5 of the Fraternal Order of
Police, said arbitrators would consider testimony and make a
decision on an expected police pay increase next week.
   Hurst criticized the city for delays in the arbitration process
which he said made it impossible for a ruling to come out in time
for other city workers to use it as a benchmark in their own
negotiations.
   By law, the police and the firefighters, rpesented by Local 22
of the Firefighters Association in talks, cannot strike.

   Prosecutors in the Pentagon bribery and fraud
investigation have learned of several instances of documents being
destroyed by people implicated in the probe, according to court
papers released Wednesday.
   The revelation was contained in a brief submitted by the office
of Henry Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va., to a federal
judge in Brooklyn who has been asked by Newsday to unseal certain
documents.
   ``In the short time since the execution of the search warrants
became public, the government has already become aware of several
incidents of destruction of documents related to this case,''
Hudson said in arguing against disclosure of the sealed documents.
   Hudson, chief prosecutor in the Pentagon investigation, provided
no details on who destroyed documents, how they were destroyed or
how they might have been related to the probe.
   In an affidavit attached to Hudson's brief, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Joseph Aronica said prosecutors had learned of ``two
incidents of document destruction by persons who are implicated in
the investigation which in two separate instants required the
securing of premises to prevent further destruction and the
emerging application for search warrants.''
   The application by Newsday, a Long Island-based newspaper, seeks
to unseal search warrants and supporting affidavits executed by
Andrew Maloney, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New
York, on June 14 as part of the larger investigation into defense
contract procurement.
   Under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagon
officials for inside information useful in winning contracts worth
billions of dollars.
   Among those targeted by Maloney's office are the Unisys Corp.
plant in Great Neck; Charles Gardner, a consultant to Unisys and
former Unisys employee; Dennis Mitchell, an employee at the plant,
and the Hazeltine Corp. in Greenlawn.
   In April, Gardner met with Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., and Unisys
engineers to discuss several defense programs in which Unisys was
involved, including Aegis, a multi-billion dollar shipboard combat
system for the Navy. Dyson reportedly is under scrutiny in the
investigation.
   Newsday's lawyer, Robert Raskopf, has argued to U.S. District
Judge Edward Korman that the seal should be lifted because the
investigation has been extensively reported in the media.
   In response, Hudson said disclosure would jeopardize the probe,
``which is in many respects still in a formulative and most
vulnerable stage.''
   ``Revealing the precise contours of the government's intentions
and current information may well encourage document destruction and
other acts would have the practical effect of putting major felons
beyond the reach of justice,'' Hudson said.
   Hudson disputed Newsday's position that much of what is in the
documents is public knowledge.
   ``In fact, previous news stories have not disclosed significant
portions of the material recited in the affidavit, particularly the
wiretap information,'' he said.
   Some of the affidavits detail targets of the investigation,
information suggesting the direction of the probe and the
government's theory of the case, he said.
   Hudson also said that the disclosure of Hazeltine's affidavit
would reveal the identity of a confidential source cooperating in
the investigation.
   Korman has yet to rule on the application for disclosure.
Raskopf said he would ask the judge on Thursday to give him until
Friday to respond to Hudson's brief.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels battling the
U.S.-backed government said Wednesday that ``a chain of combat
sweeping the entire country'' is a message of defiance to Secretary
of State George P. Shultz.
   Shultz is to spend several hours here Thursday as part of a
three-day, four-nation tour of Central America.
   The rebels, on their clandestine Radio Venceremos, described an
attack carried out Tuesday on an army base and a cotton cooperative
in La Paz province. They also mentioned other smaller attacks,
ambushes and skirmishes staged Tuesday.
   ``Attention: A chain of combat is sweeping the entire country to
tell Shultz and (President) Reagan's haggard eunuchs that here in
El Salvador a people in arms does not kneel before imperialist
arrogance,'' said the broadcast.
   The radio did not say whether there would be any military
actions Thursday.
   In another development, a leftist university student union
announced a march for Thursday morning. The march ostensibly is to
demand more government funds for the National University.
   But the union, which has participated in most anti-American
demonstrations here, was considered likely to emphatically denounce
Shultz's presence.
   Shultz left Washington on Wednesday for Guatemala City, his
first stop. He was to travel also to Costa Rica and Honduras before
returning to Washington Friday.
   The presidents of the four countries and Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega signed a regional peace accord on Aug. 7, 1987. The
accord has contributed to an easing of hostilities in Nicaragua but
has had no effect on civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   Shultz's visit comes as President Jose Napoleon Duarte is in
Washington for treatment of liver cancer. Duarte is to return to El
Salvador early next month.

   Federal agents posing as the captain and crew
of a drug smuggling ship helped seize $36 million worth of cocaine
and arrest three people in the biggest such bust in Louisiana,
officials said Wednesday.
   J. Robert Grimes, regional Customs commissioner, said the case
demonstrates that drug lords are sending more and more cocaine into
the Gulf Coast area around New Orleans as authorities turn up the
heat in Florida and Texas.
   ``The major organizations are starting to move into this area,''
Grimes said at a news conference.
   About 990 pounds of cocaine in brick-like packages were stacked
on a table as officials announced the seizure, made Tuesday near
Lafitte.
   It was the largest seizure from a vessel officials in Louisiana
have ever made, said U.S. Attorney John Volz.
   Arrested Tuesday were Louis Castro, 49, a Cuban who lives in
Miami; Alejardo Ramos, 62, of New Orleans, and Miguel Diaz, 57, of
Gretna. Maurice Sudheimer of New Orleans, a crew member aboard the
vessel, escaped and is being sought, Customs officials said.
   All four could face sentences of life in prison if convicted of
the drug smuggling charges.
   Grimes said informants provided agents with enough information
to infiltrate the smuggling operation. Agents posing as a vessel
captain and crew sailed with smugglers to international waters off
Colombia, where they took a load of cocaine from another vessel
then sailed to Lafitte, Grimes said.
   Earlier this month, an indictment unsealed in Lafayette alleged
that drug smugglers linked to Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega
conspired to import more than $1 billion worth of cocaine and
marijuana into the United States.
   The indictment accused 170 people of smuggling 500,000 pounds of
drugs, some of it through southern Louisiana, and of plotting to
smuggle in at least an additional million pounds.
   U.S. Attorney Joe Cage called it perhaps the largest U.S.
narcotic smuggling ring ever.

   Three more Marines implicated in a
pornography ring were discharged this week for ``lewd and
lascivious conduct for compensation,'' camp officials said.
   A Marine was discharged last week on the same grounds. The names
of those discharged were not released.
   The firings resulted from an investigation of a pornography ring
allegedly headed by Thomas Francis McGrath of Oceanside,
authorities said.
   McGrath was jailed last week for investigation of pimping,
pandering and running a house of prostitution after police seized
33 videos and hundreds of pictures from his house, police said. He
was freed on $10,500 bail.
   Many photos showed men, some in partial military uniform, posing
nude or performing sex acts. A catalog believed to have been
distributed nationally advertised some of the non-homosexual
material for sale, authorities said.
   Some Marines may have been paid up to $1,000 a month as the
live-in partners of other men, according to police.
   Police have said 15 to 25 Marines are under investigated for
possible involvment. Mitchell refused to say how many Marines may
be involved.
   Maj. Tom Mitchell, a base spokesman, refused to say whether
those disciplined Tuesday had appeared in videos and photographs of
men engaging in homosexual acts.
   Pentagon policy dictates that military personnel who engage in
pornographic or homosexual acts will be discharged and could face
court martial.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Wednesday that Nicaragua's government systematically has refused to
engage in good faith negotiations, compiling instead a record of
``evasions and non-compliance.''
   Opening a four-nation Central American visit, Shultz hailed the
democratic gains made in the region in recent years, but singled
out Nicaragua's lefist Sandinista government as an exception to the
trend.
   The tone of Shultz's remarks as he arrived here Wednesday night
suggested he hopes that Central American countries will bring
pressure to bear on Nicaragua to move toward a democratic system.
But he offered no specific proposals.
   The Sandinistas, Shultz said, ``have not democratized. They
continue to suport subversion in neighboring countries. Theirs is
not a record of honest negotiations.
   ``It is a record of negotiations corrupted by the Sandinistas'
efforts to destroy those who do not agree with them.''
   Instead of negotiating fairly, Shultz said, the Sandinistas have
engaged in ``evasions and non-compliance'' in talks dating back to
the revolution in 1979.
   Shultz's trip is aimed at giving Central American leaders
forceful assurances of U.S. support and at seeking common
approaches for dealing with Nicaragua.
   A senior official who briefed reporters earlier said the
administration's plan to seek renewed aid for the Nicaraguan
Contras will not be a major focus of the trip, but Shultz is
expected to hold a strategy session with rebel leaders in Guatemala
Thursday night.
   In addition to Guatemala, Shultz will visit El Salvador,
Honduras and Costa Rica, returning to Washington Friday night. No
stop in Nicaragua is planned, consistent with the Reagan
administration's policy of shunning contacts with Sandinista
government leaders until they show what Washington regards as
serious interest in moving toward a democratic system.
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, said Shultz hopes to
encourage the leaders of the four countries to pressure Nicaragua's
government to show more flexibility in efforts to achieve a final
settlement to its conflict with the pro-U.S. guerrillas, known as
Contras.
   Negotiations for a settlement broke down earlier this month and
no new talks have been scheduled. The Sandinistas and the Contras
have blamed each other for the collapse of the negotiations.
Meanwhile, a fragile cease-fire remains in place but some
insurgents, impatient with the negotiating impasse, are reported
prepared to resume the fighting.
   The Contras have received no military aid since Feb. 29 and the
consensus among both Democrats and Republicans in the House is that
any administration request for additional military aid would have
little chance for approval.
   The administration has said no decision has been made as yet on
an aid package, but some Contra supporters on Capitol Hill are
weighing the possibility of seeking approval for additional
military aid that would be released only if certain, but still
undefined, conditions are met.
   One Senate source said the military aid package likely would be
offered only if Shultz signals Congress upon his return that such a
move would be welcomed.
   But several congressional sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they thought it more likely that Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias would emphasize to Shultz the prospect of
increasing economic pressure on Nicaragua as a substitute for
Contra military pressure.
   Arias has spoken to U.S. officials about asking the handful of
European countries now giving economic aid to the Sandinista regime
to cut off that aid, and possibly about seeking a broadened trade
embargo against the regime.
   At the same time, the Sandinistas might be offered U.S. economic
aid if they meet certain targets for democratic reforms, the
sources said.
   Some hard-line congressional backers of the Contras said they
feared Shultz might go along with such suggestions. ``I detect a
diminution of zeal,'' one House Republican said.
   But Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., a leader of House pro-Contra
forces, said nothing short of a total economic boycott of Nicaragua
would have any effect. ``I see no sign Arias is willing to go that
far.''
   The countries Shultz will visit are among the largest recipients
of U.S. aid in the hemisphere. Shultz will tell leaders in each
country that U.S. support for them will continue regardless of the
outcome of the November election, the official said.
   Among the countries Shultz will visit, El Salvador appears to be
the one facing the the gravest difficulties. A leadership vacuum
has been created by the illness of President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
who is believed to have only a few months to live.
   The country also has become increasingly polarized between the
left and right, with the FMLN guerrilla movement pledging to step
up their campaign against government forces and the rightist ARENA
party scoring impressive electoral gains at the expense of Duarte's
Christian Democratic Party.

<HEAD>TVA To Lay Off 7,500 Workers To Keep Utility Competitive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Tennessee Valley Authority, the
nation's biggest supplier of electricity, said Wednesday it will
lay off 7,500 of its 34,000 workers to keep the federal utility
competitive and ensure its survival.
   ``It's very important for all of us to realize that we're not
just going through another reorganization or another reduction in
force simply to achieve a one-time budget goal,'' said general
manager Bill Willis. ``We're fundamentally restructuring TVA and
getting it in shape for the future.''
   The 22 percent reduction, to be completed by Oct. 1, is in line
with TVA chairman Marvin Runyon's goal of converting TVA from a
bloated, top-heavy organization to a businesslike structure capable
of competing with privately owned utilities.
   Runyon, formerly chief executive officer of Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. USA and a vice president of Ford Motor Co.,
became TVA chairman in January. In April he announced a program to
restructure the agency.
   He said at the time the restructuring would include substantial
layoffs.
   TVA's goal is to keep its rates the same for the next three
years. The cuts and other changes announced Wednesday are an effort
to avoid an increase of about $300 million in the budget year that
begins Oct. 1.
   ``We fully believe ... (these measures) will allow us to go into
next year with no rate increase,'' Willis said.
   The government-owned utility was founded during the Depression
in 1933 to help develop the Tennessee River basin. TVA built dams
and power plants and also undertook health, education and
conservation programs.
   Runyon said at a board meeting Wednesdasy that the number of
jobs created in the Tennessee Valley by the availability of
reasonably priced electricity eventually will more than offset the
loss of 7,500 TVA jobs.
   Those laid off will include about 4,000 full-time salaried
employees, 1,800 contract employees, and 1,700 paid on an hourly
basis.
   Runyon said 889 managers are among those let go, reducing the
ratio of supervisors to employees from 1-to-7 to about 1-to-13.
   ``We know that these decisions will be painful for our employees
who are being asked to leave through no fault of their own,''
Runyon said. ``But we are convinced, and we hope you understand,
that these actions are absolutely necessary for the survival of TVA
and for the long-term economic vitality of our region.''
   Runyon repeatedly has said TVA cannot survive unless it becomes
more efficient and competitive with utility companies outside its
seven-state region. He has said the agency can be of more help to
the region's economy by luring industry with cheap electric power
than by being an employer itself.
   More than 1,200 jobs will be lost in TVA's headquarters city of
Knoxville, 775 jobs in Chattanooga, and 329 in Muscle Shoals, Ala.
Runyon said TVA would inform every affected employee by late
Wednesday.
   Runyon said he does not believe the layoffs violate the agency's
contracts with any of the five unions that represent some of its
employees.
   There was no immediate response from the unions to Wednesday's
announcement.
   The board also approved a more moderate pace for TVA's nuclear
power program, which began in the early 1970s with an ambitious
plan to build 17 reactors. TVA has gotten as many as five reactors
in operation, but currently only one is running. The agency is
paying off $8 billion on eight plants that were canceled, Runyon
said.
   The board agreed to defer indefinitely construction at
Bellefonte Nuclear Plant near Scottsboro, Ala., until projections
indicate a need for the power. The board also agreed to reschedule
operational dates for five other reactors.

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia is in urgent need of bold
reforms to overcome deep economic and social problems and any delay
will be fatal, the country's Communist Party chief said Wednesday.
   Speaking at a session of the party's Central Committee, party
chief Bosko Krunic also indicated there will be no change in
one-party rule in Yugoslavia. He said the single-party system will
be defended ``by all means, including legal measures.''
   Delegates at last month's national party conference sharply
criticized the ruling Central Committee and demanded replacement of
leaders who have led the country into its worst crisis in history.
   Yugoslavia has been grappling with a $21 billion foreign debt,
soaring inflation, now at 170 percent, and growing labor unrest.
   The Communist leadership is moving to revive the ailing economy
by planning to introduce an open market economy with a substantial
private sector.
   ``Courageous changes, without sentimentality or illusions, are
imperative, and any delay would be fatal,'' Krunic said in his
speech.
   He said economic changes should include the immediate
introduction of a market-oriented economy. But he added the state
would continue to exercise a measure of control.
   ``If we allow the uncontrolled functioning of the market, we
would face even greater difficulties,'' Krunic said.
   During a discussion that followed Krunic's speech, Central
Committee member Radovan Radonjic submitted his resignation,
claiming the body was ``largely responsible'' for the country's
problems.
   ``The reforms cannot be implemented by those who created the
present system,'' Radonjic was quoted as saying by the official
Tanjug news agency. ``The reforms can only be carried out by new
and able men.''
   Ante Markovic, President of Croatia, Yugoslavia's second largest
republic, said the country's reforms should be implemented by those
leaders who ``carry the reforms in their souls, and that is why the
choice of the next party president is of crucial importance.''
   He was referring to the upcoming annual selection of the party's
president. The selection, to be made by the party presidium early
next month, will pit Stipe Suvar, long considered the official
party ideologist, against Ivica Racan, a liberal reformist.
   In another development, the election of a new president for the
official Slovenian Socialist Youth Union was postponed for two
months because a leading candidate is under arrest, Tanjug reported.
   Journalist Janez Jansa, one of three candidates for youth union
president, is being held by military authorities on charges of
possessing a classified army document.
   Jansa and another reporter, David Tasic, who frequently attacked
the military in their articles, were arrested last month after a
police search of their homes and offices. Military officials said
the search uncovered photostat copies of a top secret report.
   An army sergeant-major was also detained on suspicion of having
leaked the document, which reportedly dealt with the combat
readiness of Yugoslav border forces.
   The arrests sparked a wave of protests in Slovenia, where 60,000
people have so far signed a petition for the journalists' release.
About 400 church groups, companies, trade union chapters and even
Communist Party cells have donated funds toward a special defense
fund for the trio.

   A senator asked the FBI on Wednesday to give
Congress its file on a former Pentagon procurement official under
investigation in connection with alleged fraud and bribery in
defense purchasing.
   The former official, Melvyn Paisley, was assistant secretary of
the Navy for research, engineering and systems from 1981 through
1987.
   He had worked for Boeing Corp., a major defense contractor, for
28 years before taking the Defense Department job and became a
defense consultant after resigning in March 1987.
   Paisley's consulting office was bugged and his phone tapped
during the two-year investigation into allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former military men,
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could be
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Paisley was approved for the Navy job after a nine-minute
hearing Nov. 18, 1981 attended by two members of the 17-member
Senate Armed Services Committee. The full Senate confirmed his
nomination Nov. 23, 1981.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., in a letter to the FBI, said press
accounts of Paisley's activities indicated the FBI knew of
allegations of improper conduct by him while the committee was
considering the nomination.
   ``As a member of that committee, I believe it is important to
determine just what the FBI knew about Mr. Paisley at the time of
his Senate confirmation and the extent to which that information
was made available to the Senate Armed Services Committee,'' Levin
wrote.
   There have been allegations the FBI was told during a background
check for the appointment that Paisley had been involved in making
questionable payments or gifts while he was at Boeing. The
allegations were made by a former associate of Paisley's at Boeing,
by one of his three ex-wives and by a former sister-in-law.
   The transcript of the confirmation hearing gives no hint of any
controversy.
   The FBI has refused to release results of the background check,
citing privacy restrictions.
   Levin's staff asked the FBI by telephone last week for access to
the Paisley file. The request was passed to the White House, which
denied the request Tuesday, Levin said.
   ``I am therefore now requesting the entire FBI file from you,''
Levin said in his letter to the bureau.
   The current chairman and ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va.,
said in a statement Wednesday night that the committee has
researched the records it currently holds on Paisley's nomination.
   ``Those records contain a copy of Mr. Paisley's biography, his
completed financial disclosure forms and associated memoranda, and
the standard letter from him required by the committee concerning
his financial situation,'' the statement said. ``The committee's
records of the Paisley nomination contain no other information.''
   Levin was a member of the Armed Services Committee in 1981 but
did not attend the hearing.
   ``Although he was not there, his staff was there because he had
a conflict in schedule,'' said Willie Blacklow, a Levin aide.
   Asked if the senator believed he had done his duty in
scrutinizing the nomination, Blacklow said: ``If you're assertion
is this was not viewed as a major appointment, you're absolutely
right. We're finding out a bit differently now.''
   The only two senators present at the confirmation hearing were
the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., and Roger W. Jepsen, the Iowa
Republican who was acting as chairman of the committee. Jepsen was
defeated for re-election in 1984 by Democrat Tom Harkin.
   The statement by Nunn and Warner notes that they instituted new
procedures for reviewing nominees when they took their present
positions in January 1987.
   The new procedures require ``all nominees to complete an
extensive questionnaire that requests not only financial
information, but also personal background information,'' according
to the statement.
   ``The staff director and general counsel are required to advise
the chairman in writing, as well as any other interested members,
as to whether the nominee has a conflict of interest or the
appearance of a conflict of interest.... We also require a letter
from both the Office of Government Ethics and from the Department
of Defense General Counsel that any nominee does not have a
conflict of interest,'' the statement said.
   ``We require the counsel to the president to submit a letter to
the committee that describes the extent of the FBI background
investigation, the conflict of interest review, and the tax record
check. The chairman and the ranking minority member review such
information as the FBI elects to make available when any question
has been raised and that information may shed light on the issue,''
Nunn and Warner said in the statement.

<HEAD>South Africa Says 100 Cuban Troops Die In Clash; Rebels Claim
Capturing Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday
its forces killed 100 Cubans and 200 Angolans who attacked a South
African-held dam inside Angola.
   Also Wednesday, U.S.-backed Angolan rebels fighting the Marxist
government said they captured a town on the Benguela railroad, the
principal route for transporting minerals from Zaire, Zambia and
eastern Angola to the Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito.
   South African military headquarters said Monday's clash at the
dam was one of the biggest yet between South African and Cuban
forces. It reported 12 South African deaths, including 11 soldiers
killed by a stray bomb aimed at the dam during an air raid.
   South Africa's losses represent its highest acknowledged death
toll from a single engagement since its forces expanded their role
in Angola more than a year ago.
   The South African government said the attack on the dam
jeopardized peace talks aimed at resolving the 13-year-old war.
   The dam outside Calueque supplies water to South African-held
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. It is about 30 miles
north of the border.
   South Africa protected the dam under an agreement with Portugal,
which ruled Angola until independence in 1975. The attack damaged
the dam wall, the military said.
   Angola's official news agency, ANGOP, said Angolan forces acted
to check a northward South African advance. It said a heavy
concentration of South African troops close to the dam had become a
staging point for attacks.
   ANGOP said eight Angolan soldiers were killed and four wounded.
It quoted unidentified military sources as saying 26 white South
African soldiers were killed.
   The ANGOP report, monitored in Lisbon, Portugal, made no mention
of Cuban forces.
   Foreign Minister R.F. ``Pik'' Botha said the attack ``confirms
Cuba's aggressive intentions'' and said an ongoing peace initiative
is in jeopardy.
   South Africa, Angola, Cuba and the United States have held three
rounds of talks since May, including discussions last weekend in
Cairo, Egypt. A fourth round is scheduled next month in the United
States.
   UNITA, or National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
said its guerrillas seized the town of Ganda in western Benguela
province Monday.
   The statement, distributed in Lisbon, said a company of Angolan
soldiers was ``put out of action'' by the rebels, but it gave no
specific details of casualties on the government side. UNITA said
three rebels were killed and 15 slightly wounded.

   A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday
in the murder trial of former Auburn University football star Bobby
Hoppe after the jury said it could not reach a verdict in the
31-year-old case.
   ``I think that further deliberation would be fruitless,''
Hamilton County Judge Joe DiRiso said after foreman David N.
Reynolds reported the jury was hopelessly deadlocked after four
hours of deliberations.
   Hoppe, 53, is accused of using a shotgun to kill moonshine
runner Don Hudson on a dark street in 1957. He was indicted in
March after an investigation reopened at the request of Hudson's
mother.
   Hoppe testified during the seven-day trial that the shooting was
self-defense. He said he fired only after the bootlegger drove up
beside his car and pointed a pistol at him.
   Prosecutors argued that Hoppe, then a 22-year-old college
student, was angry because Hudson, 24, had beaten Joan Hoppe
Voiles, Hudson's ex-girlfriend and Hoppe's sister.
   Two jurors told reporters that the jury had voted 10-2 for
acquittal.
   A date for a new trial was not immediately set. Prosecutor Tom
Evans said he will retry the case.
   Hoppe could receive up to 20 years to life in prison. He is
charged under the law as it existed in 1957, when there was no
capital punishment.
   At the time of the slaying, Hoppe was preparing for his senior
year at Auburn, then known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute. That
fall, with Hoppe at halfback, the team went 10-0 and won their only
national championship.
   Hoppe is on leave from his position as athletic director at
Chattanooga State Technical Community College.

   The American Rose Society has
awarded its highest honor to the Hare Krishna community here for
its rose garden.
   The Krishnas' roses showed no signs of disease or insects and
had ``lots of healthy growth'' despite the drought, Rose Society
spokesman Archie Brant said Tuesday.
   The judges, in bestowing the society's national award for public
gardens, were also impressed with the garden's unusual backdrop, a
gold Indian-style palace built by Krishna devotees, Brant said.
   The devotees pamper the roses with hand watering but like most
gardeners use pesticides, despite the Hindu doctrine of respect for
all forms of life, said New Vrindaban garden director Betty Hickey.
   ``Well, that doesn't apply when you want a nice showy garden,''
Hickey said. ``You have to use some chemicals.''

<HEAD>Amnesty Calls Torture In Somalia Systematic And Routine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Torture is systematically used against hundreds of
political prisoners in Somalia, Amnesty International charged
Thursday in a report on the Horn of Africa country.
   The London-based human rights organization said Somalia was
subject to a ``persistent pattern of gross human rights
violations,'' including ``routine'' torture of suspected political
foes of the government and their long-term and often arbitrary
detention.
   Some torture victims were as young as 12 or 14 and were arrested
for collecting money for the Somali National Movement, which
opposes the government of President Mohamed Siad Barre, the report
said.
   According to testimony of victims, torture methods of the
National Security Service included bending people double and
severely beating them; electric shock; wounding with knives;
suspension upside down; sexual assault; death threats and tying
people in sacks and submerging them in water until they nearly
drowned _ either in the sea or a water tank.
   Numerous testimonies spoke of the Security Service headquarters
at Godka prison in the capital, Mogadishu, as a place of torture.
It is known as ``The Hole,'' a place from which it was extremely
difficult to escape, the report said.
   Somalia, a pastoral country with a population of 5.3 million,
has had to act as host for about 1.5 million refugees from drought
and guerrilla war in neighboring Ethiopia. It became an independent
republic in 1960, created from territories colonized by Italy and
Britain.
   Siad Barre, an army major general, seized power in a 1969 coup.
   Amnesty won the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize. It conducts worldwide
campaigns for the release of non-violent political prisoners and
opposition to torture and the death penalty.
   The report said although previous Amnesty appeals to end torture
and other grave violations of human rights in Somalia ``received
little response,'' it was again appealing to Siad Barre to stop
torture which it added probably went on during the whole of his 19
years in power.
   Amnesty said it was also asking the president to investigate
recent ``unlawful killings'' in Hargeisa, northern Somalia, where
the government is fighting rebels.
   The report, ``Torture in Somalia,'' was based on testimony by
torture victims, corroborated in some cases by medical examination,
AI said.
   The report said that in most testimony of torture, the victims
asked their identities be kept secret. However, it printed the
testimony of an architect, Seleiman Nuh Ali, who was arrested in
1982, tried last February and sentenced to 24 years' imprisonment
after a death sentence was commuted.
   Nuh Ali described how he was driven from Godka prison to a beach
and subjected to four types of torture: first being punched; then
``framed into a small ball, almost breaking my back'' and having
his testicles squeezed; having water poured into his mouth while
his nose was clasped so he could not breathe, and finally being
kicked all over his body with heavy boots.
   Nuh Ali said torture continued for two weeks until he agreed to
confess to political opposition activities.
   The report included testimony by an unidentified woman who said
that after her husband fled to Ethiopia and joined an opposition
movement there, she was arrested in 1978 and tortured for ``about a
year'' by being raped repeatedly in Godka prison, beaten, burned
with cigarettes, given electric shocks and submitted to the
sack-in-water torture.
   ``I was later put in solitary confinement for four years,'' the
woman said.
   ``Thousands of people have fled from Somalia in recent years
because of political persecution or on account of their opposition
to the government,'' the report said.
   It said some who have gone back under offers of amnesty have
been arrested, tortured and detained without trial.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Vote To Exempt Small Business Loans From Inflation
Adjustments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers rewriting the constitution
voted Wednesday to exempt small business and farm loans from
adjustments to inflation, which ran nearly 550 percent since the
loans were made.
   Legislators doubling as a constituent assembly voted 286-163 for
the exemption on debts incurred between Feb. 28, 1986 and Feb. 28,
1987.
   The article could still be defeated when the complete
constitution is voted on later this year.
   Not more than $50,000 owed by each business will be pardoned
under the measure and debtors must pay the principal within three
months after the constitution goes into effect.
   The loans were made under a 1986 government program which was
aimed at stimulating the economy.
   During the program, many Brazilians believing in a sustained
economic boom expanded their businesses to meet soaring demand. But
when the program ended as inflation soared, Brazilians once more
found themselves mired in a government austerity program, pushing
many small businesses into bankruptcy.
   Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega has said if the exemption
goes ahead, the government will pay the costs partially by raising
taxes. The rest, he has said, will push up the public sector
deficit, now running at about 6 percent of the gross national
product, and fuel inflation, which is 20 percent monthly.
   The government will cover 80 percent of the cost and private
banks will cover the balance.
   Lawmakers are writing the constitution that will replace the
authoritarian document handed down by military generals in 1969.
Brazil returned to civilian rule after 21 years of military
government in march of 1985.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has subpoenaed Northrop
Corp. and three top executives for information on a $6.5 million
payment the company made to South Korean businesses, the defense
contractor said Wednesday.
   The subpoenas were served Tuesday and Wednesday, said Tony
Cantafio, a Northrop spokesman.
   Cantafio said the executives ordered to appear before the grand
jury were Thomas V. Jones, Northrop chairman and chief executive
officer; Welko E. Gasich, an executive vice president, and William
C. McGagh, former chief financial officer.
   Although McGagh's retirement was announced in April, he has been
working with the company during a transition period, the company
said.
   The Justice Department and a Congressional subcommittee is
investigating Northrop's payment of more than $6.5 million to
Korean businesses in connection with attempts to sell its F-20
Tigershark jet fighter to the Korean military.
   Eventually, Northrop's program to develop the F-20 jet fighter
failed, with development costs estimated at $1.2 billion and
without a single plane being sold.
   The House Energy and Commerce subcomittee on investigations is
investigating whether the payment was intended to buy influence
rather than build a hotel and office project in Seoul, as Northrop
contended.
   Cantafio said in May that the 1984 payment was part of a
so-called offset program in which Northrop was to invest in Korea's
economy in return for receiving the fighter contract. Such
arangements are common among aerospace companies dealing with
developing companies and are allowed by U.S. law., he said.
   Northrop, denying it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
has portrayed itself as a victim of fraud by its Korean partners in
the hotel venture.
   ``We made this investment in 1984 in good faith and to show our
commitment to Korea on the F-20 project,'' Cantafio said Wednesday.
``We made several attempts to get the hotel built, but our partners
delayed the project. When it became clear we weren't going to get
the hotel built, we tried to get our money back by going to
arbitration in Korea.''
   A call to the U.S. attorney's office went unanswered after
business hours.

<TEXT>
   U.S. envoy Richard Murphy delivered a
verbal message from President Reagan to the emir of Bahrain on
Wednesday dealing with U.S.-Bahraini ties, the Gulf News Agency
reported.
   It said Murphy and Sheik Isa Bin Salman Al Khalifa discussed the
Persian Gulf conflict, Middle East problems and the improvement of
relations between Bahrain and the United States. It gave no details.
   U.S. ties with this island state have improved in the past year.
The U.S. naval task force that patrols the war-troubled gulf enjoys
commercial facilities in Bahrain.
   The Reagan administration recently announced it planned to sell
four F-16 jet fighters and spare parts to Bahrain for about $90
million. Bahrain previously bought 12 of the sophisticated
warplanes.
   The United States also supplies Bahrain with Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles.
   Murphy has been touring the region to discuss with leaders means
of ending the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war; Secretary of State
George Shultz's plan for ending the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the
recent superpower summit in Moscow.
   His tour included Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, the United
Arab Emirates, North Yemen and Qatar.

<HEAD>Rain Brings Some Relief to Iowa, Nebraska</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the Central Plains
across the Mississippi Valley and northern Arkansas on Wednesday,
bringing some relief to drought-stricken sections of Iowa and
Nebraska.
   A cold front pushing slowly southward across the Midwest brought
much cooler air to the Midwest and the Northeast, with early
afternoon temperatures mostly in the 60s from the Dakotas through
the Great Lakes and into northern New England.
   A tornado touched down in the early afternoon 10 miles northwest
of Sidney, Neb., thunderstorm winds blew the roofs off barns near
Fourche Junction, Ark., and marble-size hail and 2{ inches of rain
fell in less than 20 minutes at Davenport, Neb.
   Much of northern and western Iowa received 1 to 2 inches of rain
overnight. A flash flood watch was in effect for eastern Wyoming
and a flash flood watch for small streams was posted over the Pikes
Peak region of Colorado. An inch and a third of rain fell in less
than an hour in the foothills northwest of Colorado Springs.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the southern
Rockies, Florida and southern sections of Alabama and Mississippi.
Showers dotted the Ohio Valley and showers were also scattered from
eastern Washington state into northwest Montana.
   Cool weather prevailed in the Northwest, but temperatures
climbed into the 90s to around 100 degrees from the southern half
of the Plains to the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 45
degrees at Mullan, Idaho, to 104 at Little Rock, Ark., and Needles,
Calif.
   The forecast for Thursday called for more showers and
thunderstorms extending from the northern and central Plains across
Missouri, Arkansas and the Tennessee Valley into the Carolinas.
Thunderstorms will also be scattered over New Mexico, Western
Texas, Oklahoma, Florida and southern sections of Georgia and
Alabama.
   Much of the nation can expect high temperatures in the 70s or
80s, with highs only in the 60s from the Great Lakes across New
York State and northern Pennsylvania into New England. Temperatures
will reach the 90s to around 100 from the southern Plains through
Florida and southern Georgia and across the Great Basin.

   Michael Dukakis screened vice presidential running mates on
Wednesday, telling reporters afterward: ``We're making progress.''
President Reagan, meanwhile, tore into the likely Democratic
presidential nominee as a ``true liberal'' bent on more taxing and
spending.
   Vice President George Bush, certain to be the Republican
presidential nominee this fall, said the next administration must
be prepared to ``seize the opportunity of change'' in the Soviet
Union. He said the Reagan administration's military buildup had
helped nudge the Soviet Union toward openness but he added, ``The
cold war is not over.''
   Bush made his way from California to Wisconsin as a two new
polls suggested he was closing in his Democratic rival. The surveys
stood in contrast to several polls in recent weeks that put
Dukakis' lead in double digits.
   An ABC-Money Magazine survey of 1,013 adults last week found 45
percent support for Dukakis and 42 percent for Bush _ a tie, given
the margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   Another poll, this one taken over the weekend by the Gallup
organization, indicated Dukakis had 46 percent to Bush's 41
percent. The poll of 1,210 voters, which had a margin of error of 3
percentage points, was published in Wednesday's editions of the San
Francisco Chronicle.
   In another development, New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean announced
that he will deliver the keynote address at the GOP National
Convention in New Orleans in August. Kean, who was overwhelmingly
re-elected governor in 1985 with support from blacks and union
members, said he would use his prime time speech to ``show there is
a tremendous difference between the two parties.''
   But there was also some difference within the party. Sen. Gordon
Humphrey of New Hampshire, saying Kean's selection as keynote
speaker was an ``affront to the right-to-life movement,''
threatened to stage a walkout at the GOP convention if a
right-to-life partisan doesn't get equal time.
   The Republican developments came as Dukakis was spending the
better part of his day in the Capitol in Washington, meeting some
lawmakers in groups and others individually as the search for a
running mate intensified.
   ``I can't say at this point if I'm close or not so close; things
have a way of sorting themselves out,'' Dukakis said after his
series of meetings. ``We're making progress. I'll be talking with
other possible vice presidential candidates.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, favored by many in Congress for his Southern base
and his conservative political beliefs, said he was never offered
the vice presidency during a hour-long private talk with Dukakis,
but told the likely Democratic presidential nominee he wasn't
interested.
   ``I cherish my independence and the nature of the vice
presidency is a very different job,'' Nunn told reporters after
spending an hour with Dukakis. ``I enjoy making my own decisions.''
He said Dukakis accepted Nunn's desires and ``did it very
graciously.''
   Nunn is the second prominent Democrat to take himself out of the
running for runner-up on the ticket, following New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley.
   Dukakis' aides went to unusual lengths to keep the governor's
agenda private. Reporters were not told in advance who the
Massachusetts governor was meeting, and when a list was circulated
at day's end, it did not say which lawmakers met privately and
which in large groups. Nor were reporters permitted to wait outside
the room just off the Senate floor where Dukakis set up his
temporary office.
   One man prominently mentioned in the vice presidential
speculation, Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, met privately with Dukakis.
The two were scheduled to campaign together in Ohio on Friday.
   Others mentioned as potential running mates include Sens. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas; Bob Graham of Florida and Dale Bumpers of
Arkansas, as well as Reps. Richard Gephardt of Missouri; Lee
Hamilton of Indiana and Tom Foley of Washington _ although sources
said Foley had decided not to provide background information
requested by Dukakis aides.
   Jesse Jackson also has been asked to provide information about
himself, but Dukakis aides widely discount the possibility that he
will be offered a spot on the ticket.
   For his part, Jackson said he will spend much of the next week
in private, deliberating with his family about a possible vice
presidential nomination and working to free U.S. hostages in the
Middle East. Jackson had said previously that he already had made
up his mind about the vice presidency.
   Dukakis worked on completing his ticket for the fall as an
Associated Press survey of the delegates to the Democratic
Convention showed no clear consensus on a vice presidential pick.
   Of 1,200 delegates responding thus far to the survey, 534 said
they had no preference. Nunn had the support of 163, followed by
Jackson with 135, most of whom will go to the convention supporting
him for president. Glenn was supported by 106 delegates.
   In Florda, Reagan entered the campaign with a partisan vigor
unseen since his 1986 bid to re-elect Republican senators.
   ``What the 1988 elections are all about is whether we continue
to build on that progress (of his administration) and move ahead to
an even brighter future, or whether we hesitate and return to those
worn-out policies that bring high taxes, low growth and a loss of
direction and purpose,'' he said as he campaigned for Senate
candidate Connie Mack.
   He added that the man leading the Democratic ticket is a ``true
liberal who, instead of controlling government spending, raises
taxes.''
   Reagan said that Dukakis has ``spent every dime and more of the
revenue generated in his state by the Reagan-Bush (economic)
recovery. And since 1986, while the federal budget deficit has been
cut sharply, his deficit in Massachusetts has ballooned.''
   Despite Reagan's allegation, records show there hasn't been a
deficit in Massachusetts since 1982, when Dukakis inherited one
from outgoing Gov. Edward King.
   ``With all due respect, I think the president's confused,''
Dukakis said on learning of Reagan's remarks. ``It is this
administration that has given us more red ink than all the previous
administrations from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined. It
is this administration that has raised taxes four times in the last
six years.''
   Bush concentrated on foreign policy in his speech in California,
saying that the sweeping changes proposed on Tuesday by Soviet
General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev were ``revolutionary.''
   Bush said the changes taking place in the Soviet Union ``didn't
take place in a vacuum but in the context of reinvigorated American
strength.''
   He added, ``my point is this, it was eight years of American
strength that confronted the Soviet Union with the true costs of
aggression and necessity of reform.''
   Bush said the proposals forwarded by Gorbachev on Wednesday
should be watched with ``guarded optimism.''
   But, he said, ``We've got to remember that the cold war is not
over.''

<HEAD>AMA Approves Drug Policy Overhaul</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with AMA calling for testing of
new category of hospital worker, pickup 4th pvs, `Several doctors
...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association voted Wednesday
to test creation of a new type of hospital worker who would handle
chores such as taking vital signs, bathing patients and changing
bandages.
   The proposal for the new category of workers, called registered
care technologists, comes in response to the nationwide shortage of
nurses, but the plan drew strong opposition from a major nursing
group.
   The AMA's 420-member House of Delegates also called for major
changes in the nation's war on drugs and approved a detailed plan
for reforming the nation's Medicaid health insurance program for
the poor.
   The decisions by the policy-making arm of the nation's largest
doctors organization, with 295,000 members, were made by voice vote.
   The plan for the new type of worker was opposed by the American
Nurses' Association, which maintains that the answer to the nursing
shortage is higher salaries and better working conditions.
   ``I really am appalled that in the face of opposition from all
of organized nursing that medicine has gone ahead with this
decision,'' said Judith Ryan, executive director of the American
Nurses' Association.
   The House of Delegates rejected an attempt to delay the pilot
project to allow more time for study.
   The new workers would receive from two months to 18 months of
training.
   Nurses argued that isn't enough training and said the
technologists would duplicate the role now played by nursing
assistants, licensed practical nurses and technical registered
nurses.
   In regard to drug trafficking, the delegates rejected efforts to
delay action on a report calling for major changes in the war on
drugs. The AMA said the United States is losing the war to rich,
sophisticated drug traffickers.
   The delegates said ``real progress'' will only be made by
shifting the attack from catching smugglers to treating abusers.
   Several doctors complained they hadn't had enough time to study
the proposal, but many more delegates said the problem was too
urgent to delay action.
   ``It is (a) farsighted (report) and it would be a tragedy if it
were not adopted,'' said Dr. Saul Levin of Sacramento, Calif.
   ``This is a major issue before this country,'' said Dr. Lonnie
Bristow, an AMA trustee from Berkeley, Calif. ``We are saying this
nation does have the will to overcome the drug problem, but it
simply has the wrong game plan.
   ``We must approach the demand side of this problem by treating
those who are sick ... and thereby reducing the demand for those
who traffick in this filthy product,'' Bristow said.
   With an estimated $30 billion to $100 billion in annual revenue,
drug traffickers can counteract federal crackdowns, the AMA report
says.
   ``They can acquire sophisticated technology, bribe public
officials and recruit new members,'' it contends. ``Real progress
is likely to come only from a major shift in primary emphasis away
from supply-reduction and enforcement strategies and toward
demand-reduction strategies.''
   Shifting their attention to another pressing social problem _
uneven medical care for the poor _ the AMA policymakers proposed
creating uniform nationwide eligibility standards for Medicaid and
uniform payments for medical care.
   The delegates voted to lobby the federal government to create
the standards and expand Medicaid to cover an additional 27 million
poor people at an increased annual cost of $24 billion at 1988
spending levels. The program, administered by state governments,
covers an estimated 19 million poor people at a projected cost of
$52 billion in 1988.
   An AMA report on Medicaid said the program is ``in desperate
need of reform'' because the lack of national standards has bred
``severe inequities'' in the level of medical care benefits
provided to poor people.
   In other action Wednesday, the House of Delegates:
   _Continued the AMA's war on tobacco, approving a proposal to
lobby Congress to double the federal tax on cigarettes from 16
cents per pack to 32 cents.
   _Called on state and federal governments to reform the court
system to limit the amount of money awarded in product liability
lawsuits. A report approved by the delegates contends that
biomedical companies are holding off on developing new vaccines,
drugs and other ``potentially life-saving technologies'' because
they are afraid of being sued.
   The drug policy approved Wednesday recommends that the federal
government expand drug abuse treatment programs, ease regulations
to permit private doctors to treat opiate addicts with methadone
and increase drug education programs aimed at adolescents.
   The policy also calls on the president to appoint ``a
high-ranking official of the Executive Branch to coordinate federal
drug policy'' to keep rival agencies from working at cross-purposes.

   Attackers armed with hand grenades
and automatic weapons ambushed the van of a university president
Wednesday, killing three of his aides and wounding the educator and
three others, a radio station reported.
   The private radio station DZRH quoted witnesses as saying Dr.
Nemesio Prudente was rushed to a hospital. His condition could not
be immediately ascertained.
   It was the second ambush for Prudente, president of the
government-run Polytechnic University of the Philippines. A
university lawyer was killed in the first ambush last Nov. 11. That
incident remains unsolved.
   A homicide officer at Manila's police headquarters said all they
knew was that a shooting occurred and a team of investigators was
sent to the scene. The officer, who refused to identify himself,
said the team had not reported back.
   DZRH, reporting from the scene, quoted witnesses as saying the
assailants hurled a hand grenade at Prudente's van and then sprayed
it with bullets. Prudente's bodyguards immediately covered him with
their bodies, the station reported.
   It said the attack occurred a few yards from the Polytechnic
University of the Philippines in Manila's Santa Mesa district.
   Human rights groups blamed Prudente's first ambush on right-wing
extremists.
   Prudente's first ambush came a week after soldiers and police
chanted ``Kill Prudente!,'' whom they view as a left-wing figure,
during an emotional funeral for a police captain and two other
people killed by communist guerrillas.
   Police and the military accused Prudente of using the university
as a shelter for communist urban guerrillas. Prudente denied it.

   Customs agents have arrested a British man who
allegedly schemed with the Iranian ambassador to Spain to illegally
ship 10 military-type helicopters to Iran, authorities said
Wednesday.
   The arrest of Colin Breeze has apparently ended attempts to lure
other conspirators into the country, said Patrick O'Brien, head of
the U.S. Customs Service here. But he said agents suspect the
operation was part of a larger network.
   ``We are continuing the investigation to look for diversions of
military equipment to Iran,'' O'Brien said, but refused to give
other details.
   Breeze, a 33-year-old British citizen, was held without bond in
the Metropolitan Correctional Center south of here after the
federal government declared him a risk of flight.
   He is accused of trying to smuggle 10 Sikorsky S-36 helicopters
to Iran by arranging to have them sold to a European company
secretly owned by the Iranian government, O'Brien said.
   U.S. law forbids exporting arms without a permit.
   Iran's ambassador to Spain was helping arrange the deal and
intended to take a cut from the $30 million sale to his own
government, said O'Brien.
   The 10 Sikorsky helicopters were originally sold to the
Jordanian air force in 1979 and 1980. Six were later traded back to
Sikorsky but remained in Jordan, and all 10 were for sale at
$675,000 each.
   Sikorsky spokesman Bob Stangarone in Stratford, Conn., confirmed
that the company owned the six helicopters but said it had never
dealt with Breeze.
   ``The S-36 is a military-type helicopter,'' said O'Brien. ``They
are basically a troop carrier, a civilian version of the Blackhawk.
These things are great over the desert.''
   In May, the affidavit said, Breeze approached a confidential
informant for the Customs service about buying the helicopters for
Iran. The informant advised Customs and coversations between the
two were taped by authorities.
   In the conversations, some of which took place in Spain and some
in the United Kingdom, Breeze told the informant the ultimate
purchaser was Iran.
   ``Breeze further advised that negotiations for the purchase were
being conducted through a Spanish national middleman and the
Iranian embassy in Madrid,'' Customs agent Thomas Bailey said in
the affidavit.
   Last week, Breeze told the informant that the sales agreement
was on its way by diplomatic pouch from Madrid to Iran for final
approval. But he later said it was held up because the ambassador
was insisting on a larger share of the profits.
   ``Frankly, it's standard in these Iranian cases,'' said O'Brien.
``They raise their price at the last minute.''
   Breeze was arrested Tuesday at the Fort Lauderdale airport
because authorities were afraid he was about to leave the country.
He was taken before a U.S. magistrate and was scheduled for a full
hearing Friday.

<HEAD>10 Aides to Deposed President Manigat Released In 2 Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ At least 10 supporters and aides of
deposed President Leslie Manigat have been released from jail in
the last two days after being held for a week, Radio Haiti-Inter
reported Wednesday.
   Rodney Marcellus and Serge Martineau, both militants of
Manigat's National Democratic Progressive Rally and former
Information Ministry employees, were released Wednesday from the
political prison Fort Dimanche, the station said.
   Manigat's Information Minister Roger Savain and his son Roger
Jr. were set free Tuesday, along with six others.
   The Savains and two other former Manigat aides, Jean-Yves Noel
and Narcaisse Lescouflair, said in an interview on state-run TV
that they were well treated while in jail. It was unclear whether
charges ever were filed, or whether the four _ and others _ were
interrogated or simply locked up.
   Also released Tuesday were four ex-Manigat aides identified by
the Ministry of Information as U.S. citizens Robert Benodin, Frantz
Jean-Louis and Jean Bogart; and Harry Carrenard, a Haitian-Canadian
with dual nationality who was Manigat's minister of social affairs.
   Capt. Isidore Pongnon, commander of Fort Dimanche, told
Haiti-Inter before the release of Marcellus and Martineau that
``seven or eight'' more Manigat aides still were being held, but
would soon be released.
   Those still under arrest include Lionel Desgranges, Manigat's
former chief of staff.
   More than a dozen of Manigat's aides and advisers, including at
least three U.S. citizens, were arrested hours after Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy installed himself in the National Palace the night of June
19.
   Two days earlier, Manigat fired Namphy, at the time the army's
commander-in-chief, and placed him under house arrest for
insubordination.

   Police have stepped up patrols around
Arab-owned businesses after the slaying of a black man by an Arab
grocery clerk sparked several firebombings, police and community
leaders said Wednesday.
   ``Everybody's got bad feelings, and these come from isolated
incidents,'' said Patricia A. Blackmon, the city's chief prosecutor.
   Ms. Blackmon, who has met with community groups in recent days
seeking to calm racial tensions, said blacks are demanding higher
quality food, lower prices and more courtesy from Arab shopkeepers.
   Arab shopkeepers, representing Egyptians, Lebanese, Iranians and
Palestinians, have complained of repeated thefts and slow response
time by police, Ms. Blackmon said.
   Tensions erupted June 18 when a black man, James Slaughter, 31,
was shot and killed by an Arab clerk, Eiab Taher, 33, who was
charged with involuntary manslaughter. The following night, a crowd
ransacked the store in apparent retaliation.
   The tensions have resulted in a rash of firebombings of
Arab-owned businesses, including one store set afire three times in
as many weeks, authorities said.
   In response, police have increased patrols in black
neighborhoods where Arabs have businesses, and police community
relations specialists are working with community leaders on the
problem, said Detective Robert Bolton, a police spokesman.
   ``We don't want it to escalate to anything. If there are
problems that have to be fixed, that's fine,'' Bolton said.
   City Council member Helen Knipe Smith, whose district includes
the neighborhood where an Arab store was firebombed, said most of
the grocers and small delis in the area are operated by Arabs.
   She said the Arabs follow the Jews, Irish, Italians and blacks
who in succession operated family-run businesses in the city's
ghettoes.
   She blamed tensions on a need by ghetto businesses to charge
higher prices than larger chain stores operating in the suburbs and
a concern by Arabs about crime.
   Mayor George V. Voinovich said the city has increased health
inspections at groceries.
   ``Neither the proprietors of stores or any member of our
community should take the law into their own hands,'' he said.
   In response to the tensions, the Cleveland Community Relations
Board has formed a joint Arab-black committee to improve relations,
executive director Earl Williams said.

   Somali rebels have appealed to the United
Nations to investigate purported government massacres in the
war-torn north and organize massive relief aid for other victims, a
guerrilla spokesman said Wednesday.
   Ahmed Mohamed Silanyo, Somali National Movement chairman, wrote
to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Saturday
urging him to seek an ``independent evaluation'' of drugs and food
needed by civilians caught in the cross fire in the past month,
according to a copy of the four-page letter.
   ``The inhabitants of towns and settlements which have been, and
are still being, indiscriminately shelled and bombed from the air
are currently unable to defend themselves,'' Silanyo said. ``They
look to the United Nations and world opinion to protect them.''
   Silanyo sent the letter from his exile headquarters in London,
and a rebel official delivered a copy to The Associated Press in
Nairobi.
   In it, Silanyo said water and power supplies were cut in many
areas, unburied, decomposing corpses in streets threatened to
trigger a cholera epidemic, food was scarce and medical supplies
virtually exhausted.
   Silanyo renewed rebel claims that they control key northern
centers including Hargeisa, Somalia's second largest city, and the
regional capital of Burao, since mounting a major offensive against
President Siad Barre's army late May.
   In retaliation, he wrote, warplanes bombed civilians in villages
and troops massacred suspected rebel sympathizers, many through
``summary executions'' in public.
   Barre's government repeatedly has denied atrocity charges,
accusing the insurgents of killing civilians and looting. The
government insists that since last week, its troops have been
controlling all northern centers.
   But foreign travelers who arrived this week in Nairobi, the
Kenyan capital, from neighboring Somalia said rebels were holding
on to Burao and other towns while fighting continued for Hargeisa.
   The Westerners, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said a
dusk to dawn curfew was still in force in the capital, Mogadishu.
They said troops there were commandeering vehicles, including those
owned by foreign aid workers.
   Silanyo, a former Cabinet member in Barre's government, helped
form the Somali National Movement seven years ago.
   Barre seized power in a 1969 coup. Since 1977, he has been a
staunch African ally of the United States.

   Police knew 3{ months ago that one of four people
slain this week in a dispute among radical polygamists had been
threatened with death, an investigator says.
   ``We were contacted March 10, and we conducted a preliminary
investigation,'' into the threat against Mark Chynoweth, homicide
Lt. Richard Holland said Tuesday. He declined to say who contacted
the homicide division.
   ``We didn't pick anyone up for questioning,'' he said.
   Police on Wednesday guarded frightened relatives of the four
victims, former followers of the late Ervil LeBaron, a polygamous
cult leader whose current followers operate from Mexico.
   No arrests have been made in the slayings, which Holland
characterized as the work of ``religious extremists.''
   Local authorities and the FBI searched for three brothers for
questioning in the case. One is Heber LeBaron, who is wanted in a
1986 bank robbery in Richardson. He fled after being released on
bail, officials said. Police also sought Aaron LeBaron, 20, and
Andrew LeBaron, 28.
   In addition to Mark Chynoweth, 36, his brother, Duane Chynoweth,
31, and Duane's daughter, Jennifer, 8, were slain Monday in
Houston. In the Dallas suburb of Irving, Eddie Marston, 32, another
former cult member, was gunned down at almost the same time.
   Investigators are trying to determine if Monday's slayings were
directly related to the Chynoweths' past involvement with Ervil
LeBaron.
   Ervil LeBaron, founder of the Church of The Lamb of God, a
radical polygamist group believed responsible for more than 20
killings, died in prison in Utah in 1981.
   Before his death, LeBaron targeted a number of people for death,
primarily for being unfaithful to his preaching, his daughter
Lillian Chynoweth told The Salt Lake City Tribune in October.
   The victims had been followers of LeBaron but had broken from
the religious zealot after his 1980 conviction on a charge of
conspiracy to commit murder. Marston was a stepson, and Ervil had
been married to the Chynoweths' sister, Rena.
   Holland said investigators believe others in the Houston area
may be in danger because of the dispute that led to Monday's
killings.
   Meanwhile, Marston's girlfriend said former group members in
Houston had tried to warn him of a likely attempt on his life, but
their call came after he was already dead.
   ``They were calling to tell Ed that somebody had been shot,''
said the woman, who asked to be identified only as Beverly. About
half an hour later, Irving police officers came by to say that
Marston was dead.
   Houston authorities also had alerted the Irving Police
Department about the killings, said Irving Police Lt. K.L. Rowe.
``By then, it was too late,'' he said.
   The woman said Marston received a call Monday morning from a man
offering a washer and dryer. Marston was directed to a house, but
no one showed up. The caller telephoned again, telling Marston he
could pick up the appliances at 4 p.m. if he was still interested.
He went back to the house and was fatally shot.

   Michael Dukakis, hoping to underscore the
impact of this year's dry weather, got a firsthand look at a
relatively healthy corn field Wednesday but stressed ``the
importance of pulling together'' to help farmers suffering from
drought.
   ``This is a problem that affects farmers and farm communities
and farm states and consumers,'' Dukakis said. ``We are very much a
part of this. We're one nation and one community and one family.''
   His comments came as Dukakis made a brief stop at the Howard
Hughes farm just south of Des Moines.
   Hughes conceded he was ``a little embarrassed'' to have his farm
be the staging ground for a visit aimed at pointing up drought
problems _ because rain just fell on his 160-acre farm and the corn
is nearly seven feet high.
   ``My corn does look pretty good,'' Hughes said.
   Though Hughes' farm isn't the most hard-hit in the state, it
does have at least one major tactical advantage. It's located about
four miles from the end of the runway at the Des Moines airport and
quickly accessible for Dukakis' motorcade.
   Dukakis spoke to about 250 people under threatening skies and in
chilly weather that caused many to don sweaters.
   ``I don't know whether those storm clouds overhead mean Dukakis
brings good fortune,'' he said. ``I hope so.''
   Dukakis was accompanied on the tour by Illinois Sen. Paul Simon,
a former rival for the nomination, who appealed for party unity.
   ``There is a time to fight and a time to heal,'' Simon said.
   After a brief round of speeches, Dukakis was led on a tour of
the farm and told by Hughes that the apparently healthy corn
wouldn't last long without rain, although he conceded it has a lush
appearance.
   Just under an inch of rain fell on the Hughes' farm overnight,
and that comes on top of a 2.5 inch downpour earlier in the month.
   ``What this does is, it's kind of a tantalizing rain,'' Hughes
said. ``It prolongs things and it makes my corn look better.''
   Simon warned reporters not to jump to any quick conclusions
about the status of the crop simply because it looked good.
   ``Don't get any false impressions, even though that corn looks
better,'' Simon said.
   Vice President George Bush, the certain Republican nominee, had
a similar farm visit in Wisconsin on Wednesday.
   Hughes said his farm presents a fairly lush backdrop for a
drought tour. ``Really, I'm a little embarrassed by it,'' he said.
   But he said even crops which look good now will soon be
threatened by dry weather.
   ``This is a point that we're going to have to drive home real
hard with people who aren't familiar with farming,'' Hughes said.
``My corn is six or seven feet high and getting ready to tassel,
but if we have some more searing heat and no rain I don't have
stalks with enough vigor to produce ears.''
   Hughes said recent rainfalls are far too little and too
scattered to do much about ending this year's drought.
   ``It gives me a few more days over the farmer who didn't get
any,'' he said.
   ``To illustrate how fickle these rains are, I have a dear friend
just north of here who only got two-hundredths while Indianola just
south of here got an inch. It's just in a little pocket,'' Hughes
said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Searches for Veep Candidates in Congress; Nunn Says Count
Me Out</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS 5 grafs with farm visit</NOTE>

   Democrat Michael Dukakis met with senators
Wednesday in his search for a vice presidential candidate, and was
told by one _ Sam Nunn of Georgia _ to count him out.
   ``I can't say at this point if I'm close or not so close; things
have a way of sorting themselves out,'' Dukakis said after his
series of meetings. ``We're making progress. I'll be talking with
other possible vice presidential candidates.''
   The all-but-certain presidential nominee spent an hour in
private with Nunn, a favorite of southern and conservative
Democrats, during a day filled with private meetings on Capitol
Hill _ including individual sessions with at least three other
possible running mates.
   ``I told Governor Dukakis that I was honored to be considered,
to be on the list,'' Nunn said. ``I told him I was still not
interested in the vice presidency.''
   Dukakis also met privately with Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas and Bob Graham of Florida, he told reporters while
leaving the Capitol.
   He said he would be back in a week or so to meet with other
potential candidates.
   Nunn had previously indicated a lack of interest in the post,
but he had been pushed by conservative Democrats who want a
geographic and ideological balance on the ticket. The meeting with
the likely nominee enabled Nunn to relay his decision in person.
   ``He accepted the decision and he did it very graciously,'' Nunn
said.
   The two then discussed ``seven or eight'' other potential vice
presidential candidates, Nunn said.
   The Georgia senator is the second major prospective candidate to
take himself out of the running. Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
recently withdrew from consideration.
   Nunn said his move should not be taken as a reflection of
Dukakis. ``My feeling on the subject had absolutely nothing to do
with Governor Dukakis,'' he said.
   Despite the rejection, Dukakis said he had ``a good day, a very
helpful day.''
   ``I cannot emphasize too much the kind of cooperation and
response that I've gotten. It's been terrific,'' he said.
   The Massachusetts governor met with 29 senators and nine House
members, including some of the lawmakers often mentioned as
potential running mates: Bentsen, Glenn, Graham, and Rep. Tom
Foley, D-Wash.
   Glenn, who figures high in the vice presidential speculation,
declined to comment. He was flying home to Ohio to appear Friday
with Dukakis, who was stopping in Dayton on a Midwest campaign
swing, said a spokesman, who declined to be identified.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, whose Democratic presidential
campaign failed to catch fire outside the South, was not invited to
meet with Dukakis, said Gore press secretary Mike Kopp.
   Foley met with Dukakis during the governor's lunch with a group
of agriculture committee members. He said they did not discuss the
vice presidency, but added that he would meet again with Dukakis in
a week or so. Foley declined to comment when asked if he had turned
over background information to the Dukakis campaign.
   Dukakis shuttled from meeting to meeting through corridors
cleared of bystanders by Capitol Police, and he said nothing on the
few occasions reporters caught glimpses of him.
   Dukakis later departed on a five-state campaign swing through
the Midwest.
   Accompanying Dukakis was his senior adviser Paul Brountas, who
is leading the campaign's search for a running mate and is heading
a team of lawyers who are reviewing financial records and other
information about prospective candidates. Brountas and other aides
left the room during the Nunn meeting.
   Nunn told reporters after his meeting with Dukakis that he had
taken himself out of the running because he prefers his Senate job
to the vice presidency.
   ``I cherish my independence and the nature of the vice
presidency is a very different job. I enjoy making my own
decisions,'' Nunn said.
   Nunn was among the Democrats asked by the Dukakis campaign to
supply personal and financial disclosure information. He declined.
   ``I considered filling out forms to be essentially a job
application and there's no reason to do that if you're not
interested in the job,'' Nunn said.
   He said that although Dukakis ``urged me to keep my hat in the
ring,'' he did not engage in any form of pressure or arm-twisting.
``He made no move for my arm,'' Nunn said.
   He said that at no point did Dukakis ever directly ask him to be
his running mate. ``I would not have put him in that position,''
Nunn said.
   Dukakis press secretary Dayton Duncan said that Dukakis did not
have a deadline for selecting the running mate, and planned to
return July 13 for meetings with House members. That would be five
days before the Democratic National Convention opens in Atlanta.
   ``He doesn't feel like he's under any timetable or deadline,''
Duncan said.
   Dukakis met first with a group including most of the 16 Senate
Democrats facing re-election races this year, a group that included
Bentsen.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said they discussed the vice
presidency without mentioning names.
   ``He said the process is still open, and he's enjoying the
process,'' Kerry said. He said Dukakis invited suggestions on a
running mate.
   Dukakis also held a lunch with nine Democratic members of the
Senate Agriculture Committee and 10 members of the House
Agriculture Committee to discuss the drought in farm states.
   Later, Dukakis toured the farm of Howard Hughes near Norwalk,
Iowa. The farm actually got some rain the night before, but Hughes
said even if his corn crop looks healthy now, it won't produce ears
if it doesn't rain some more _ and soon.
   Hughes said some farms in the state were much harder hit by the
drought than his. But his farm is only about four miles from the
Des Moines airport, and lent itself to a quick campaign-style stop.
   ``This is a problem that affects farmers and farm communities
and farm states and consumers,'' Dukakis said after a brief tour.
``We are very much a part of this. We're one nation and one
community and one family.''
   Dukakis spoke in chilly weather, under skies threatening rain.
   ``I don't know whether those storm clouds overhead mean Dukakis
brings good fortune,'' he said. ``I hope so.''

   Abdala Bucaram, a fiery politician who
lost a presidential runoff in May, fled Ecuador for Miami Wednesday
to avoid arrest, his wife said.
   If would mark the second time in three years that the leader of
the populist Roldosista Party went into self-exile.
   Judge Luis Herreria ordered the 36-year-old Bucaram arrested
Tuesday after he failed to appear in court in mid-June.
   The politician was to make statements regarding alleged
diversions of Guayaquil city funds, which were said to have
occurred when he was mayor in 1984-85.
   ``He left the country because the judicial action had become
politicized,'' his wife, Maria Rosa Bucaram, told a news conference
in this port city, 180 miles southwest of the capital city of Quito.
   Mrs. Bucaram said her husband left Guayaquil on a 10 a.m. (11
a.m. EDT) flight aboard a plane owned by the cargo company AECA.
The flight could not be confirmed by late Wednesday.
   Bucaram lost the May 9 runoff to Rodrigo Borja, Social Democrat
and leader of the Democratic Left party, who replaces President
Leon Febres Cordero in August.
   Bucaram went into exile in Panama while still mayor in late 1985
to escape imprisonment for having allegedly slandered the armed
forces, a criminal offense in Ecuador. He said the military was
good only for wasting money on parades.
   While in Panama he was arrested for possession of five pounds of
cocaine. He claimed it was a frame-up arranged by Febres Cordero, a
political enemy. Ecuador's Congress granted him amnesty on the
military offense and Panama eventually dropped the charges.
   He returned in August 1987 to a hero's welcome from his
followers in Guayaquil's shantytowns and almost immediately
launched his presidential campaign.
   Analysts said Bucaram's presence as a strong presidential
contender sparked repeated rumors of a military coup during the
campaign.

   Leftist guerrillas raided four farm
settlements, killing 25 men in revenge attacks against peasant
self-defense patrols, the military said Wednesday.
   Thirty Shining Path guerrillas, six wearing police and army
uniforms, carried out the attacks Monday and Tuesday, the military
said in a communique released in this highland capital, 235 miles
southeast of Lima.
   The military said the Maoist rebels left messages in the
villages, all in the Acon River valley about 55 miles northeast of
Ayacucho, which warned villagers against taking part in the patrols
organized by the army.
   Six men and two women were wounded in the attacks, the military
said.
   The communique did not describe the violence, but rebels have
held mock trials and shot or stabbed to death hundreds of patrol
members in dozens of attacks.
   The government says more than 10,000 people have died since the
Shining Path launched its insurgency from the impoverished Ayacucho
highlands eight years ago.
   Most of the dead have been peasants caught up in the struggle
between the Mao-inspired rebels and government forces, officials
say.

   Police investigating abusive phone calls received
by a woman said Wednesday they traced some of the calls to the home
of a City Council member with whom she had clashed over monitoring
of the Police Department.
   The council member, Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Diane Ragsdale, denied
making the calls, labeling the charges as a ``set up'' by police.
   Ms. Ragsdale is a vocal critic of the Police Department and its
use of deadly force against minorities.
   Carrie Delano, an ardent supporter of the Police Department,
said that she received abusive calls and a death threat after a
shouting match with Ms. Ragsdale at a council meeting June 8, and
that she asked police to trace the calls.
   Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. traced four of the calls to Ms.
Ragsdale's home, four to the home of her sister, Charlotte
Ragsdale, and one to a number listed to an R. Benson, said police
Capt. Dolan Hargrove.
   Diane and Charlotte Ragsdale said neither they nor other members
of their households would have made such calls.
   No charges have been filed. The Dallas County district
attorney's office is investigating.
   ``I will not be sidetracked by this electronic provocation,''
Ms. Ragsdale said. ``All of these allegations reinforces the fact
that there are bad apples in the Police Department.''
   Ms. Ragsdale, the city's highest-ranking elected black official,
had argued with Mrs. Delano over an effort to weaken a citizens'
police review board. The two called each other racists. Ms. Delano
is white.
   Acting Police Chief Lou Caudell confirmed police are
investigating calls made to Mrs. Delano and that authorities had
placed a ``trap'' on her phone.
   Ms. Ragsdale, 35, lives with her 74-year-old mother and her
12-year-old nephew.

   The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the
power of independent counsels to prosecute illegal acts by
high-ranking government officials, a momentous constitutional
decision and a defeat for a handful of former White House aides
such as Oliver L. North and Michael K. Deaver.
   By a 7-1 vote, the justices said a 1978 law inspired by the
Watergate scandal does not violate the Constitution's command that
the powers of the executive, legislative and judicial branches be
separate and balanced.
   The ruling clears away a potential stumbling block in the
prosecution of North, the former National Security Council aide;
John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's former national security
adviser; and two arms dealers indicted in the Iran-Contra arms and

   The government said Wednesday its chief
economic forecasting gauge dipped slightly in May, the first
setback since January, but analysts shrugged off the tiny downturn
as no threat to prospects for the rest of the year.
   The Commerce Department reported a 0.1 percent decline last
month in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, primarily
reflecting weakness in the stock market, manufacturing orders and
the labor market. But at the same time, the department revised
upward, from 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent, the gain it had initially
reported for April.
   Economists dismissed the May estimate's small decline, the first
since a 0.2 percent decrease in January, and said it did nothing to
shake their belief that growth would continue at least through the
remainder of 1988 with no danger of recession.

   President Reagan plunged into the 1988 White House
campaign on Wednesday, attacking Michael Dukakis as a liberal bent
on ``worn-out policies'' of tax raises and runaway government
spending.
   ``Should we expect that if the Democrats' all-but-certain
presidential candidate is elected that he would raise taxes? In
fact, he just did,'' Reagan said, mocking the recent cigarette tax
Dukakis signed in an effort to head off a state budget deficit.
   Dukakis, told of Reagan's remarks, told reporters: ``With all
due respect, I think the president's confused.''
   He defended his own economic record, contrasting it with that of
the administration.
   ``The next president will inherit a fiscal mess _ I think we all
know that...And one of my jobs as president of the United States
will be to straighten out this mess,'' said Dukakis.
   Reagan, in an address prepared for a Florida GOP fund-raising
event in support of Rep. Connie Mack III's Senate bid, fired his
harshest barrage yet at Vice President George Bush's likely
opponent. The speech marked his first political foray outside the
capital this campaign season.

   A medicine widely used for gout appears to
dramatically slow the lethal destruction of cirrhosis, but doctors
disagree over whether it should become routine treatment for this

   In a report published Thursday, a team of Mexican researchers
said they found ``a striking, consistent, statistically significant
benefit'' of the drug colchicine. After 10 years, more than half of
those who got the medicine were alive, compared with less than a
quarter of the people in an untreated comparison group.
   Earlier versions of the 14-year study have been published and
presented at medical meetings over the years, and many U.S. experts
are familiar with the work. Despite the impressive results,
however, opinion is divided.

   Jim Bakker said Wednesday he has received
a $100 million line of credit to buy back the failing PTL ministry,
but he refused to name the lender.
   ``We are ready to go forward with earnest negotiations,'' Bakker
told reporters outside U.S. Bankruptcy Court, adding he wants to
keep PTL's Christian retreat intact.
   PTL trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said he has received four offers
to buy the ministry, one for $200 million. Benton said that if
Bakker's proposal is substantiated, ``he will be considered along

liberalize Britain's sweeping secrecy laws by decriminalizing
trivial leaks and giving journalists more legal protection.
   Another key clause would confine secrecy mainly to defense,

   The opposition Labor Party denounced the proposals as

   Researchers at five laboratories around the
world say they have independently confirmed the existence of a
curious antibody reaction that should, by any conceivable theory,
be impossible.
   ``It's unbelievable and it breaks all the rules,'' said one of
the researchers, Patricia Fortner, an immunology research associate
at the University of Toronto.
   The researchers have found that antibodies that react with
certain blood cells will continue to react when diluted far beyond
the point where they should theoretically be able to.

<HEAD>Something To Worry About</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the economic scene calming down after a
succession of crises _ trade imbalance, falling dollar, recession
threat _ the current big concern of economic worry warts is a
familiar one: inflation.
   From researchers at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. comes an
``economic flash'' about ``early signs of wage acceleration.''
Service sector wages, it states, have accelerated significantly in
the past three months.
   The pervasive drought adds urgency to the inflation message,
since commodity prices could force increases in the consumer price
index.
   Jack Lavery of Merrill Lynch & Co. comments that ``enough damage
has already been done to corn, wheat and soybean crops to
accelerate food-price increases this year, although the full extent
of the damage remains to be seen.''
   At Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, it isn't only drought that
produces worries. ``Our concerns about inflation have never been
based on the weather,'' say researchers there.
   Instead, they observe that apparel prices are higher than they
were a year ago, gasoline and fuel-oil prices have risen for
several months, and medical care costs have continued to set
records, as they have for years.
   The worriers fall into two distinct camps. Those who fear
inflation via higher commodity prices or wages are citing a
cost-push scenario. Others fear the threat is from demand-pull, as
from high levels of consumer demand.
   While the worriers might not be growing in number they are
shouting louder, and in the otherwise quieter economic setting that
has evolved in the past month their voices are carrying farther.
   Are they worth listening to?
   Other commentators observe that there is always an inflation
threat. It is ever present, ready to end any economic expansion if
allowed to gain headway. You can always cite it as a threat, they
say. It is always available for duty.
   ``Cost-push inflation scenarios don't make economic sense,''
according to a paper released a few days ago by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. It explains:
   ``Sellers to the final consumer can only raise prices if
competitors and consumers are willing to go along. Otherwise,
sellers must absorb cost increases by cutting other costs or
accepting lower profits.''
   Right now, it states, competition is intense among sellers. The
latter are more concerned about meeting competitor prices than they
are about raising margins. They are fighting for a limited number
of consumer dollars.
   It is true that wages show signs of rising, but there are few
indications that they are rising faster than productivity.
   Offsetting the wage pressure, the anti-inflationists contend, is
growth in the nation's capacity to produce as well as an increase
in productivity. Money is being spent on enlarging capacity, and on
making it more efficient.
   ``The core rate of inflation has been remarkably stable,'' says
Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Since
1985, he states, it has hovered between 4 percent and 4.5 percent.
Some things have risen; others have fallen.
   He attributes this partly to investment in new facilities, and
demographics as well. He asserts that the nation's problems with
baby-boomers have ended, at least in the production of goods.
   In retrospect those problems were enormous. Youngsters flooded
the labor markets. They were inexperienced. They were inefficient
producers. And, because there were so many available, business
didn't bother with efficiencies.
   Now it's different. Says Yardeni: ``The shortage of young job
seekers will force businesses to invest in labor-saving and
productivity-enhancing plants and equipment.'' And efficient
production is anti-inflationary.
   Will that stop the inflation worries? Not likely, at least until
something bigger seizes the stage.

<HEAD>Women Still Increasing In Seminaries, As Male Majority Shrinks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of women in seminaries continues to
increase, while the number of men decreases, with some predictions
that by the year 2000, a fourth of mainline Protestant pastors will
be women.
   Women still encounter some resistance in roles as church
leaders, while male clergy are tending to be older. Nonetheless,
the ecclesiatical presence of women spreads, as do the gray hairs
among male ministers.
   Summing up statistics for the 1987-88 crop of seminarians, the
Association of Theological Schools says women now constitute 27
percent of total enrollment.
   Fifteen years ago, when inclusive figures first were gathered,
women amounted to only 10 percent of enrollment 15 years ago.
   Compared to an enrollment then of 3,358, the ranks of women have
swelled fourfold to 15,310, up 3 percent this year. But the overall
enrollment was down by 1 percent to 55,766.
   It was the third straight year of overall decline, as men became
a gradually shrinking majority in 20l Protestant and Roman Catholic
seminaries, while the proportion, and numbers, of women rose in
contrast.
   Despite the increase in their numbers, women say they still face
obstacles as clergy. In the United Church of Christ, which has the
largest number of women _ totalling 1,460 _ a survey found that 61
percent say they've been turned down for jobs because of their
gender.
   However, the Rev. Ann Cordray, a United Church pastor in Miami,
says ``there's a great deal more openness toward women leadership
in the church than we had for a while.''
   Most other major Protestant bodies _ United Methodist,
Episcopal, Presbyterian and Lutheran _ now admit women to
ordination, although they're barred from it in Roman Catholicism
and Eastern Orthodoxy.
   Roman Catholic study of the issue is advocated in a new bishops'
draft paper on women.
   The International Bulletin of Missionary Research forecasts that
by the end of the next decade, one out of four pastors in mainline
Protestant congregations will be women.
   An encouraging note among male Catholic seminarians came in a
nationwide survey that found them more satisfied with their
training than their counterparts about 20 years ago.
   For example, 88 percent considered their training ``very
relevant'' or ``fairly relevant,'' while only 68 percent did so in
1966. A majority of those studying for the priesthood _ 58 percent
_ approved women being in seminaries.
   The findings show ``much greater satisfaction'' and ``more
confidence'' among Catholic seminarians, say the researchers, the
Rev. Eugene Hemrick and sociologist Dean Hoge of Washington.
   Meanwhile, the average age of male seminarians has increased
from 22 to 32, with an increasing proportion of ``delayed
vocations,'' men who have worked in other careers and then switched
to study for the ministry.
   Fourteen percent of seminarians are over 40.
   The Rev. Hugh Thompson, now minister of Oakwood Forest Christian
Church in Kingsport, Tenn., had been an accountant before he gave
up a lucrative job to pursue seminary training.
   ``I'm sure my friends thought I'd gone off my rocker,'' he says,
noting that the seminary years drained his family's finances. ``But
any financial loss has been more than compensated.''
   He says concentrating on making money can be a disillusioning
addiction. However, he says ministers who previously have worked in
the secular atmosphere aren't ``shocked by what they find in the
world because they've been there.''
   The Rev. Jack McWhirter, now pastor of Concordia Lutheran Church
in Kingsport, had been a teacher before entering the ministry.
   ``I think it gave me a little more mature look at the
congregation's needs, he says, ``a better balanced way of
ministering to people.''

   If Disney can build fantasy parks

   Wilcox of West Palm Beach, Fla., has formed ``Jerusalem 30 A.D.
International Ministries,'' and wants to raise $2.5 billion to
build te project on 25,000 acres of arid land 60 miles south of
Midland.
   He says the Texas ``holy city'' will be a place of reflection

employes and visitors will wear biblical-era garb.
   He says it will feature a seminary, museums, art galleries, a
Roman theater, a sports arena with chariot racing, marketplaces,
palaces and medical facilities.
   Midland Mayor Carroll Thomas has some doubts about the plan,
saying, ``I don't think it's economically viable at all or
realistic. It's got some romance to it and I think people are
latching on to that.''
   Wilcox says skeptics will prove wrong. ``As for doubting
Thomases, they laughed at Walt Disney when he came up with Snow

<HEAD>Mary Ann Pascal Became Actress Because She Looked Like One</HEAD>

   Mary Ann Pascal had never given acting a
thought, but because of her voluptuous beauty people kept assuming
she was an actress.
   ``I never trained as an actress. I never thought about it until
I was 26,'' said Pascal, who stars on the Showtime comedy series
``Brothers.''
   ``I was working in a boutique, learning the business so I could
open my own place. But when you look like I do, people always
assume you're an actress. Anywhere else, I suppose, they'd think
you were somebody's mistress. A man who later became one of my
managers said I really should try acting.''
   It quickly fell into place for her. She got a job on her first
interview, which got her into the Screen Actors Guild. She was cast
as a ``Hammerettes,'' one of the women executive producer Jay
Bernstein hired to walk through ``Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer.''
   ``Obviously, these women are not brain surgeons,'' said Pascal.
``I went to Frederick's of Hollywood and bought a push-up bra. I
looked exactly like what I was supposed to look. Afterward, I
burned the bra and told my agent I didn't want any more parts like
that.''
   She did guest shots on ``Hotel,'' ``Knight Rider'' and
``Remington Steele.''
   ``Brothers'' was her first comedy and her first time before an
audience.
   ``When Tuesday night came around I was trembling,'' she said.
``There'd be 600 eyes on me. They say that after a while it becomes
like nothing, and it does. Now it gives me adrenalin and energy,
but in the beginning it was terrifying.
   ``Now that I've done drama and comedy, I'd pick comedy every
time. The hours are so much better. You can lead a normal life
around it.''
   Since then, she's also had roles on ``Night Court,'' ``Crime
Story'' and the TV movie ``Blood Vows: A Mafia Wife's Story.''
   Pascal is married to Michael Pascal, marketing executive of the
Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino. She lives in Las Vegas and is
unofficial hostess of the casino. She commutes to Los Angeles for
filming.
   Because of some unsavory fan mail she is taking pistol lessons
and practicing her marksmanship. ``I play this very sexy person,''
she said, ``and people who don't have a good grip on reality
confuse me with the character. I'm a happily married woman and have
been for almost 10 years.''
   Pascal stars on ``Brothers'' as Sam, the girlfriend of Joe
Waters (Robert Walden). The show focuses on three brothers, played
by Walden, Brandon Maggart and Paul Regina. Regina's character is
gay, as is a family friend played by Philip Charles MacKenzie.
Hallie Todd plays Walden's college-age daughter.
   ``Brothers'' opened its fifth season on Showtime last Friday
with Sam announcing she was pregnant.
   ``My character is so full of herself,'' said Pascal. ``She can't
believe that no one would drop dead to marry her. But she and Joe
decide to get married. On the next show they're already married.''
   The baby will be born on the 10th episode of the season, which
will be the 100th episode for the series.
   The fly in the ointment, however, is that only three shows were
taped for the new season before the writers' strike. If the show is
forced to go into reruns after the third show, the producers will
select best shows from the past seasons.
   ``Brothers'' will go into syndication in the fall of 1989.
``They're getting into more boy-girl relationships so it will have
broader appeal for syndication,'' said Pascal. ``They're diluting
the gay theme.''
   Pascal, who was born in New York and grew up there and in
Florida, said acting is work but that being hostess at the Golden
Nugget is play.
   After she was persuaded to become an actress, she said, ``I had
visions of what I would be. I thought of `Dynasty.' I imagined I'd
be Alexis. And I end up as Lucy. When I was a kid all I wanted to
be was a nun.''

<HEAD>Stage And Screen ``Orphan'' Finds Himself a ``Home''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kevin Anderson came to fame as the wild,
youthful kidnapper in the play and film, ``Orphans.'' However, his
new movie, ``Miles From Home,'' shows the actor's more taciturn
side.
   ``This guy is so quiet,'' the 28-year-old Anderson said. ``Most
of the time I just had to try to exist, to be there and to listen.''
   Anderson talked about the movie in an interview at the recent
Cannes Film Festival, where the $6 million movie had its world
premiere in May.
   Scheduled for an American release in October from Cinecom, the
film co-stars Anderson and Richard Gere as two brothers on a family
farm in Iowa who destroy their property rather than face
foreclosure on it.
   Gere is the impulsive older brother, Frank Roberts, a man quick
to take action regardless of the consequences. Anderson is the
shyer, more tentative Terry, who comes to respect his brother as
they become joint outlaws on the run.
   The film drew mixed reviews at Cannes for its somewhat dogged
earnestness. But there was general acclaim for Anderson's ability
to make passivity engaging in a film that puts two brothers
center-screen, as ``Orphans'' did.
   ``(Maybe) there's some brother hang-up I need to work out,''
joked the soft-spoken actor, himself the youngest of three brothers
from Gurnee, Ill.
   However, there are differences between the parts: ``It was
difficult to find the arc of Terry because he is largely silent,''
he said of ``Miles From Home,'' which marks the film directing
debut of Gary Sinise, a long-time colleague of Anderson from their
days at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company.
   ``In `Orphans,' I was so soundly rooted in the character, I
didn't have to worry about nerves,'' he said of the earlier film,
which began life as a Lyle Kessler play for Steppenwolf, directed
by Sinise and acclaimed in Chicago, New York and London.
   The film, directed by Alan Pakula and co-starring Matthew Modine
and Albert Finney, fared less well. Reviews were mixed-to-good but
the box office was low, contrary to the hopes of its star, whose
prior movie credits were limited to one line in the popular comedy
``Risky Business.''
   ``I received a lot of attention for `Orphans' on-stage so I
really wanted the movie to be special,'' Anderson said. ``I was
very disappointed; the studio kind of gave up on it.''
   Anderson will also be seen this year in Ray Silver's ``A Walk on
the Moon,'' playing a peace corps volunteer in Ecuador in 1969. His
co-star, Terry Kinney, is a Steppenwolf alumnus who has a
supporting role in ``Miles From Home'' alongside other Chicago
talents such as Moira Harris, Francis Guinan and, in a vivid cameo,
John Malkovich.
   Despite his increased screen exposure, Anderson remains attached
to the stage. Last December, he headed an exemplary company of
young New York actors in an off-Broadway revival of Michael
Weller's ``Moonchildren.''
   He is currently playing the celebrated gigolo of the title in a
revival of the musical ``Pal Joey'' at Chicago's Goodman Theater.
The Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart classic, co-starring Carlin
Glynn, runs through Aug. 7 with the chance of an extension.
   Anderson said he was enjoying reprising one of Broadway's most
famous cads in a bitter and pungent show considered ahead of its
time when it opened in 1940. What the stage can't offer in salary,
it makes up for in quality, he said.
   ``You have to work on something,'' he said, ``and for me there
are so many lousy movie scripts that you might as soon do a decent
play than some lousy movie.''

<HEAD>Peltz Uses `Junk' To Build Packaging Empire; Attention Turned
Toward Homeless</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY12 of June 28</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the surface, Nelson Peltz might seem like
just another corporate raider.
   He got where he is today _ heading the world's largest consumer
packaging concern, Triangle Industries Inc. _ through a series of
acquisitions financed largely through the personal services of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk-bond whiz, Michael Milken.
   Milken also has provided much-needed leverage for many other
takeover strategists like Carl C. Icahn, who, incidentally, lives
near Peltz in the verdant Westchester County suburbs of New York.
   But Peltz parts company from Icahn and others who sell off parts
of their newly acquired companies for quick profits and displace
many of the target company's workers.
   ``Our goal is to buy companies and build it up,'' the
46-year-old Peltz said in a recent interview. ``I invest in a
business, make it grow and make sure it competes.
   ``We don't like to strip a company ... to tear it apart.''
   Since Peltz and long-time associate Peter May gained control of
Triangle in 1983, after working for Peltz's family-owned
food-supply business in New Jersey, the company has expanded from a
copper-wire and cable manufacturer with annual sales of $264
million to a packaging giant with more than $4 billion in sales.
   In fact, most people can barely go a day without coming in
contact with a Triangle-made beer bottle, soda can, toothpaste tube
or potato chip bag.
   When Peltz took the helm at Triangle, ``The company was low in
money ... It didn't have too bright a future and needed direction.
   ``The previous management had promised to liquidate the wire and
cable division. That would have meant 1,000 people out of work. We
didn't liquidate the business. We kept it going and rebuilt it.''
   Peltz was determined to rebuild the entire company. He amassed
his packaging empire by gobbling up National Can Corp. in 1985 and
purchasing American Can Co.'s packaging business a year later.
Peltz and May are now in the process of increasing to 80 percent
their voting shares of Triangle by having a smaller subsidiary, CJI
Industries Inc., buy the parent.
   ``It's like watching a baby grow,'' he said with a touch of
pride, admitting that he'd like another addition to his business
family. ``We're always looking at all kinds of things.''
   It is with that same vision and gusto that Peltz has approached
his latest ``rebuilding'' project _ helping the nation's homeless
get back on their feet through transitional housing financed by big
business.
   Peltz was recruited more than a year ago by Tipper Gore, wife of
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, to help fund a nationwide tour
for an exhibit of photographs aimed at raising the public's
awareness of America's homeless.
   His own interest piqued, he decided to go a step further with
the building proposal.
   Such a civic-minded task might seem a bit out of character for a
wealthy industrialist like Peltz, who is used to the good things in
life: posh New York offices decorated with expensive antiques and
paintings; a private corporate chef; a large homestead outside of
New York City and a second home in Florida shared with his
former-model wife, Claudia, and four children.
   But the Brooklyn-born Peltz said he is touched by the plight of
the homeless. And besides, his keen business sense tells him that
if something isn't done now to stem this growing social problem,
big businesses will undoubtedly have to pay somewhere down the line
through higher taxes.
   ``The government clearly is not going to spend the money. I
don't know if the government is capable of doing enough,'' Peltz
said. ``They (big corporations) have to take an active role because
it's a problem we face.''
   Peltz's goal is to eventually build transitional multifamily
homes for the homeless in major U.S. cities, with each facility
housing between 30 to 40 families. He estimates each building would
cost half a million dollars.
   Although still in its fact-finding stage, Peltz has been
circulating a slick ``coffee-table'' book, based on the ``Homeless
in America'' exhibit, to big corporations to garner their support.
   Peltz has even tapped the same Washington-based lobbying group
involved in his efforts to promote high-yield, high-risk junk bonds
to further his cause. The group, National Strategies and Marketing
Group, is helping move Peltz's housing dream off the drawing board
by formulating specific plans for building and financing.
   ``No one has taken an active role in this fight. We would like
to be a catalyst,'' Peltz said.

   Like most FBI agents, Robert Brannon spends his
day doing legwork, making contacts, developing leads.
   But Brannon is on the tail of mortgage officers and real estate
agents, not mobsters or terrorists, and his most wanted list
consists of affordable suburban homes within two hours of Manhattan.
   His assignment: find housing for FBI agents transferring to New
York.
   The FBI is one of many organizations finding it harder and
harder to persuade employees to take assignments in a city with the
highest cost of living on the U.S. mainland and levels of dirt,
noise and congestion to match.
   That big transfer to the New York office is being regarded more
warily by the organization man _ and the organization woman.
Homequity Inc., the nation's largest corporate relocation firm,
says 50 percent of transfer offers to New York are rejected,
compared to 25 percent two years ago.
   When 143 corporations were asked to list the three areas to
which transferees expressed the most resistance, New York was named
by 73 percent; the next highest, Los Angeles, was named by only 39
percent, followed by Boston (38 percent) and San Francisco (31
percent).
   Although the transfer was once an accepted part of the trip up
the organizational ladder, Americans have become more resistant to
such moves, particularly if the destination is an expensive urban
area.
   This resistance is most apparent in New York, with its peerless
concentration of corporate headquarters, government offices and
non-profit agencies.
   About a fifth of the nation's 1,000 largest companies have
headquarters in the New York region, 121 of them in the city
itself. The city of Chicago, the second most popular corporate
base, has 37.
   But last year 16 companies announced plans to leave New York,
including J.C. Penney and Mobil Oil, both of whom cited employee
reluctance to transfer here as one reason for their move.
   For government and non-profit agencies, New York is even tougher
to sell.
   Even though New York offers what the FBI's Brannon calls ``some
of the best work in the organization,'' in areas such as organized
crime and counter-intelligence, it is last choice among the
nation's FBI agents, and the office is short about 100 agents.
   When the Coast Guard reorganized its civilian work force last
year and asked more than 100 employees to transfer to New York, all
but a few refused.
   It's easy to see why. Runzheimer International, relocation
consultants, says the $50,000 it takes to support an executive with
a spouse and two children for a year in suburban Tampa, Fla., or
Columbus, Ohio, would have to increase to $70,000 to do the same in
New York. Boston, the next priciest region, is far behind at
$62,000.
   New York has $7 movie tickets (at most Manhattan theaters), $22
parking tabs (for 10 hours at a midtown garage) and the most
expensive regional housing market in the United States, barring the
costly outposts of Alaska and Hawaii.
   In the first quarter of 1988, the average price of a two-bedroom
apartment south of 96th Street, a traditional real estate boundary
line of personal and financial security, was $468,000. The median
price of a single family home in the metropolitan region was
$186,600, compared to a national figure of $88,100. That gap,
relocation experts say, reflects the growing disparity between
living costs in larger and smaller cities.
   ``The price swings are so huge now,'' said Michael Schell,
president of Moran, Stahl & Boyer, relocation consultants. ``The
differences were always there, but the magnitude has become so
enormous it would seem to make relocation impossible in some
cases.''
   One result is horrendous commutes, as late entrants to New
York's overheated housing market are forced to seek less expensive
shelter farther and farther from work.
   The daily odyssey of Frank Carlin, an executive at Catholic
Relief Services, illustrates one reason for the agency's decision
to move to Baltimore next year.
   When Carlin was transferred to New York two years ago he settled
in the central New Jersey town of Plainsboro because he couldn't
afford housing closer to CRS's offices in Manhattan.
   He must leave home at 6:40 each morning, drive to the train
station, ride to Manhattan, take the subway uptown and walk 15
minutes to his office. By the time he reverses the process, it
often is 9:30 or 10 p.m.
   If CRS had not decided to move, ``I couldn't continue it much
longer,'' he said. ``It really has taken a toll on our family. I
barely see my kids.''
   Beyond housing, New York has ``image problems to be overcome,''
admitted Schell.
   Lance Barclay, a Moran, Stahl vice president, is often reminded
of that as he flies into New York. ``We're all admiring this
magnificent view of Manhattan, and somebody will say something
like, `Somebody down there is getting mugged.' You don't feel the
same sort of resistance to L.A. or San Francisco.''
   Many Americans, he said, regard the city as ``a place where the
pace is too fast and the people are too arrogant.''
   Although many approaches to overcoming relocation resistance are
tried, ``it generally boils down to dollars,'' said Joseph Sasanno
of Homequity. ``The limo that meets you at the airport is window
dressing.''
   Federal workers, however, get neither the limo nor the dollars;
the government pays civil servants in New York no more than
anywhere else, although a trial cost of living raise for New York
has been proposed in Congress.
   Corporations increasingly offer assistance in selling the old
house and buying a new one, and in getting a mortgage for the
latter. Many companies also offer bonuses, loans, salary
adjustments, housing allowances and miscellaneous moving budgets.
   When he was recruiting for American Express in Manhattan,
Barclay would try a simpler approach ``to get people to see the
more positive side of things.''
   If it were a nice day, he would take his visitor outside, buy a
couple of beers and franks, and conduct the interview on the Staten
Island Ferry.
   ``On that ferry, on a good day, with that view of Manhattan _
you got 'em.''

<HEAD>Turkish Juliet, West German Romeo Fight to Unite Two Worlds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen-year-old Yasemin lives
in a modern West German city, but has to wear skirts nearly down to
her ankles, plead to go to school and can leave her watchful father
only in the escort of a male cousin.
   ``Yasemin'' is a critically acclaimed film about a young Turkish
woman, born in West Germany, who struggles to fit into a society
her immigrant parents and family perceive as alien and corrupting.
   And, although the story is fictional, it accurately reflects
conflicts faced by many of West Germany's 1.5 million Turkish
workers and their families. Many of them were invited to work in
West Germany during the country's post-war economic boom.
   The movie, along with a recent film called ``40 Square Meters
Germany'' and new Turkish-language cable TV stations in West
Berlin, is part of an increasing awareness about the plight of
Turks reflected in the entertainment world.
   ``It's the realistic story of a cultural conflict,'' director
Hark Bohm said in an interview. ``And it has, of course, social
implications.''
   The combination Turkish-German language movie portrays the large
Turkish community in Altona, a working-class neighborhood in
Hamburg. Hamburg residents call it ``Little Istanbul.''
   There, Turkish women who date German men are thought to have
lost their virtue. A bride's family is disgraced if a bridegroom
cannot display a sheet stained with virgin blood after the wedding
night. And the threat of deportation underscores relationships with
teachers, the police and even doctors, for some of the workers are
in West Germany illegally.
   Bohm, who lives in Altona and speaks some Turkish, spent three
years doing research, talking with neighborhood families and young
people. One of them, a Turkish girl, even showed him her diary.
   ``That became the basis for my story,'' Bohm, a well-known actor
and director, said. ``This girl eventually married her German
boyfriend, despite conflict with her family.''
   The lovers in ``Yasemin'' do not marry, but end up riding off
together on a motorcycle.
   The love story begins when Yasemin and Jan, a West German, meet
in a judo class. At first Jan's interest in Yasemin is based on a
crude adolescent bet.
   ``There's no woman I can't get within three days,'' Jan boasts
to friends, and tries for Yasemin, who rejects his overtures.
   But Jan persists, despite attempts by Yasemin's father to keep
the two apart. In one touching scene, he spray-paints a request for
a date on a wall outside her bedroom window. In another, he runs
after a bus in which she is riding, jubilantly holding his new
Turkish language lesson book up to the window.
   Indeed, the two lovers spend most of their courtship gazing at
each other across streets and through windows. Even when they
finally kiss, it is only with a window pane between them.
   Yasemin's father catches them and threatens to send his daughter
``back home,'' meaning Turkey.
   ``You mean your home,'' Yasemin cries. ``I was born here!''
   Yasemin's youngest sister, also born in West Germany, can hardly
even speak Turkish.
   Like many Turks in West Germany, Yasemin's father owns a small
produce store where all members of the extended family pitch in.
   The story has a much more positive note than ``40 Square Meters
Germany,'' released two years ago. The movie by Turkish-born
director Tevfik Baser concerned a Turkish worker who literally
locks up his wife in their tiny Hamburg apartment in order to
protect her virtue.
   ``Turks have told me they find Yasemin's father much more
sympathetic than that husband,'' Bohm said. ``He loves his daughter
deeply, and really just wants to protect her.''
   Turks have a harder time fitting into West Germany than workers
from Spain, Yugoslavia and Italy, Bohm said.
   ``The Turks brought a whole different cultural tradition here
with them,'' Bohm said, adding that much of that tradition stems
from their adherence to the Moslem faith.
   Jan is played by Bohm's 26-year-old son, Uwe. Yasemin is played
by teen actress Ayse Romey, who was born in the United States to a
Turkish woman and an American soldier. She was raised in West
Germany, where she now lives.

   Patty Casey literally used to count the days
between visits from roving evangelist Mario ``Tony'' Leyva.
   ``Tony was like a breath of fresh air,'' she said. ``He preached
the word of God and always took such an interest in our children _
especially the boys.''
   Casey and her sister Barbara Gish, both born-again Christians,
now say they wish they'd never heard of Leyva, who stands accused
of having oral sex with two Roanoke County boys and of taking at
least a dozen boys, including two of their sons, across state lines
for prostitution as his traveling revival meeting crisscrossed the
South and Midwest.
   ``The boys were like `kept women' in that they were hauled
around with him from town to town for sexual purposes,'' said U.S.
Attorney Jennie Montgomery, the prosecutor in the case.
   ``And those are just the ones we know about, the ones who have
been willing to come forward,'' she said. ``Leyva ... probably has
molested young boys everywhere he's gone. I'm talking about a
multitude of children.''
   The alleged molestations, which spanned two decades, took so
long to surface due to a mix of shame, ignorance and stubborn faith
in a man who claims Jesus appeared to him at age 12 and anointed
him to preach the Gospel.
   Now the self-ordained preacher faces two trials: one begins July
26 in Roanoke County, where he is charged with committing ``crimes
against nature'' with two boys; the second, set for Oct. 3,
concerns federal charges of transporting minor males ``with intent
to engage such minors in criminal sexual activity and
prostitution.''
   Charged with Leyva in the federal indictment are two associates,
Rias Morris, 47, his organist and business manager, and the Rev.
Freddie Herring, 49, a fellow evangelist who sometimes filled in
for Leyva at revivals and who operates the Lighthouse Assembly in
Douglasville, Ga.
   Montgomery said the three men were charged with prostitution
because they gave the boys money for sexual favors. They have
pleaded not guilty and are free on $20,000 bond each.
   The FBI, which investigated the case, said most of the victims
were aged 13 to 16 and often were problem kids Leyva had promised
to help.
   Montgomery said Leyva, 42, is a smooth-talking, charismatic
performer who easily persuaded his audiences _ mostly
unsophisticated, working-class people _ to give him money and lend
him their sons for what he termed ``special religious instruction.''
   She said the boys were swept off their feet by the flamboyant
preacher, who sometimes dressed up in a Superman costume and
portrayed himself as ``Super Christian.'' At a typical ``Miracle
Restoration Revival,'' Leyva prowls the stage, jumps up and down,
shouts, wails and speaks in tongues. Collection baskets are passed
around several times at each of the performances, which end with
the crowd pressing forward for Leyva's touch.
   Casey, who offers child care in her Roanoke home and whose
husband is a factory worker, said Leyva had showered her four sons
with gifts and money and taken them to revivals in such distant
cities as West Palm Beach, Fla., and Atlanta in luxury automobiles.
She said her boys idolized Leyva.
   The case opened up last fall, after Casey and another mother
contacted authorities. Casey came forward after a heart-to-heart
with her youngest boy, then 16, who had just spent several weeks
traveling with Leyva and his associates.
   ``I guess I was too trusting, but I wanted my boys to be good
Christians. I let him take them, one by one, to teach them in the
Lord,'' she said in an interview.
   Gish said she regretted introducing her sister's family to Leyva
in 1976.
   ``I was a widow at the time and was happy about the attention he
paid to my boys because I felt they needed a good, strong Christian
father figure,'' she recalled. ``I told my sister about this
wonderful man of God.''
   But she said she started to wonder about Leyva when her three
sons returned home from trips depressed and angry and with their
pockets full of cash.
   ``They were different boys after spending time with Tony
Leyva,'' Gish said. ``And I would wonder why he would be buying
them airplane tickets and giving them cash when he'd always say at
his meetings that he desperately needed money for a new tent or an
orphanage in Haiti or something.''

   She said she tried to talk with her sister about her suspicions,
but she wouldn't listen.
   ``I thought Tony Leyva was what he claimed to be _ a man who had
been anointed by God to preach the gospel,'' Casey said. ``I
thought he was above suspicion, but (in prayers) God finally spoke
to me about Tony Levy and I made my youngest son admit what had
happened between them.''
   When asked why her older boys hadn't warned their brothers,
Casey said, ``They told me they were too ashamed. Also, they were
afraid of these men.''
   Her nephew, Gish's eldest son, echoed Casey whenasked why he
hadn't spoken up earlier: ``Frankly, I was ashamed by what had
happened. It's embarrassing to talk about it.''
   Gish's son, now 21, asked not to be identified by name but said
in an interview that Leyva first seduced him when he was 11.
   ``He got me the third time my parents took me to see him. It was
in a motel room in the Roanoke area. He cried and said he was
lonely. He said it (oral sex) would be all right as long as nobody
found out.''
   Gish's son said that over five or six years, he made numerous
trips with Morris, Herring and Leyva, who gave him hundreds of
dollars. He recalled one specific gift of $400 and ``a lot of
times'' when he was handed more than $100.
   The federal indictment, handed up in late April, alleges Leyva,
Morris and Herring used youngsters as prostitutes from 1983 through
1987 in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Arkansas, Ohio and Indiana. Leyva also is charged with
having sex with boys as early as 1967 in Hendersonville, N.C., his
mother's hometown.
   Leyva's ex-wife and mother of their two children, Mary, still
lives in Hendersonville. She appeared before the grand jury at
Roanoke and is scheduled to testify against Leyva at the October
trial, according to Montgomery.
   Leyva has been separately indicted in Roanoke County on charges
he orally sodomized two boys in Roanoke motels.
   All three men have refused to discuss the charges, but Leyva has
told supporters Satan is trying to wreck his ministry. He has
continued to conduct crusades, saying he needs donations to fight
the conspiracy against him.
   Herring told reporters after his indictment that he felt ``in
the same position right now as Jesus was when he was on the cross.
Right now, it's open season on ministers.''
   Leyva's followers maintain his innocence. One of them,
18-year-old Richard Greene of Roanoke, said he'd traveled with the
preacher and never saw anything out of line. But in the same
interview, Greene said Herring had made homosexual advances toward
him.
   Gish's son said Levya used to photograph him nude and traveled
with a footlocker full of pornographic photos of young boys.
   Montgomery said several of Leyva's youthful accusers mentioned
pornographic photos, but no photos were found in searches of
Leyva's business headquarters or his International School of
Evangelism, which he set up in Columbus, Ga., last fall.
   Montgomery also said Leyva appeared to have no previous arrest
record, although police in Salem, west of Roanoke, received a
report in 1983 that Levya had molested a young boy.
   ``The alleged incident did not take place in our juristiction so
we passed our findings along to the FBI,'' said Salem detective
J.R. Bryant, who added that he warned Leyva that police would watch
him whenever he came to town.
   ``I guess he got the message because he never came back,''
Bryant said. ``Actually, I'd never heard of the guy before we got
the complaint. We're not talking about Billy Graham, you know; this
was just another small-time evangelist. ... There were never more
than 30 or 40 people at his meetings.''
   David Henderson, Leyva's spokesman, predicts the entire world
will know about Leyva before this case is finished.
   ``It's a tragedy what's happened to this fine man of God,''
Henderson said.
   Patty Casey differs with Henderson about who has been wronged.
   ``I don't mind so much about all the money we gave Tony Leyva,''
she said. ``What hurts so much is what he's done to all these good,
Christian children.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In this apocalyptic year of heat and drought,
the most feared of the Four Horsemen is fire. On Friday, June 10,
the town whistle sounded in Bainville, Mont., population 245.
Sparks from a westbound Amtrak passenger train had ignited
grasslands. For the next 72 hours, in gusts up to 50 mph and
temperatures above 105 degrees, hundreds of lives were touched by
fickle winds and unforgiving flames. Here are the stories of two
families. The Crismans and the Wilsons were neighbors and close
friends living a mile apart: one ranch was saved, the other was
lost.

   Ralph and Mary Jane Crisman, doing what
they'd done together nearly every day of their 58 years on the
ranch, had just sat down to lunch when they smelled the smoke.
   ``We saw it drifting through the yard,'' said Crisman, 81, a
farmer all his life. ``We called our neighbors to try and find out
where the fire was. The store in town said it was under control.
Then they called back and said it wasn't.''
   Crisman got in his pickup and drove to the top of the south
ridge.
   ``Visibility was about three miles and I still couldn't see it,
so I went back home.''
   He told Mary Jane she'd better get the engagement ring he'd
given her 60 years ago, just in case. He grabbed a handful of tax
records.
   ``All at once I saw the flames a half mile away,'' he said. ``In
five minutes it was in our yard, traveling 40 miles an hour. The
bridge across the crick was on fire so we drove north across the
pasture. Mary Jane's got a heart condition and she was getting
pains. I told her to take some more of those nitro pills, but I was
sure I was gonna lose her along with everything else.
   ``I tried to take it easy, but we had to get out. When the car
quit on me I was afraid we were done for, but I got it started
again. When I looked back, all I saw was flames. The barn was gone
and the house was next. I took a last look at my tree.''
   Crisman told his story in a quiet, resigned voice as he stood
amid the devastation of his entire life's work. Rubble from the
farmhouse had collapsed into the basement, an enormous jigsaw
puzzle of charred appliances, twisted iron and steel, melted glass.
   The blackened bones of an ironing board leaned against the
burned-out guts of the furnace; 400 carefully preserved jars of
home-canned food had exploded in a corner; a big file cabinet, its
doors still closed, futilely sheltered piles of heat-powdered paper.
   All the outbuildings were gone. So was the carefully tended
garden down by the cottonwood trees whose bark was seared off and
branches were dead sticks. A ghost of a tractor baked under the sun.
   The unrelenting wind lifted the charred topsoil and swirled it
around the rancher as he hunched his back to it. Bending to pick up
a handful of grit, Crisman already knew his land had turned to
cinders that were blowing away to the Dakotas.
   ``The '30s was bad but this is just as bad, maybe worse,'' said
Crisman, who was semi-retired and wasn't raising cattle this year.
``With the drought, the prairie was so dry we were just waiting for
disaster, and it came.
   ``It's a shock to me. When you've spent a lifetime building up a
farm, it's just like losing a person that you love.''
   The Crismans' only child, a daughter, died of pneumonia when she
was 6 months old. They seldom heard from relatives in Arizona and
Florida. Their ranch was their world.
   Of Crisman's 1,200 acres, 900 were burned. The blaze, which
totaled about 17,000 acres in eastern Montana and western North
Dakota, didn't injure anyone but destroyed part of another house
and an empty homestead, killed some cattle, and left critical
pasture land useless in a year in which grass is precious.
   The Burlington Northern Railroad said it will handle claims
adjustments because the Amtrak passenger train whose sparks ignited
the fire June 10 was traveling on BN property. A BN official held a
meeting in Bainville to pass out the railroad's one-page claim
forms. Chrisman has vowed to get a good lawyer, but he wonders how
long the settlement process will drag on because ``at my age, time
isn't on my side.''
   ``My wife's bitter about it,'' said Crisman, his gaze always
returning to the remains of his home. ``When the fire started
nobody came around to help us move out. When you get old, people
forget about you.
   ``Mary Jane won't ever come back and look at it. She said to me,
`I've made up my mind I'm not going to cry. It's done, it's over
with, and I'd like to forget the whole thing,''' said Crisman.
   That first night, in shock and with just the clothes on their
backs, the Crismans stayed in a motel in Williston, N.D., 25 miles
east of Bainville, then moved in with friends before deciding to
get an apartment in Williston.
   ``It makes me feel like I've lost all my freedom,'' said
Crisman. ``It's a nice enough place, but I'm stuck in it. I feel
like somebody's said to me, `You're old now, you just sit in that
rocker and rock your life away.' ...
   ``It feels like we're on vacation and it's time to go home but
there's no home to go to. This is it for us. I guess we're gonna
stay right here until we die. We don't move around much _ just once
in 58 years.''
   Of everything they lost, Mrs. Crisman misses her prized cedar
hope chest the most.
   ``It was crammed full of handmade treasures from her mother,
crocheted things and lace tablecloths,'' said her husband. ``It's
enough to break her heart.''
   And what of his heartbreak? What will he miss the most?
   ``That,'' he said simply, pointing to the 5-foot-tall skeleton
of a fir tree that looked like it was welded out of iron.
   ``I told the Burlington Northern man I wouldn't take $2,500 for
that tree,'' said Crisman. ``I planted it next to the house so it
could get runoff from the roof. I put it next to the bathroom
window so we could look at it a lot. Trees are so precious in this
country. I knew the birds would find it, and they did. We've had a
nest in that straight little tree for the past three years. There
were baby birds in it when the fire came.''
   For the first time on that hot, sad day, Crisman had to pause in
his recollections to gather himself together.
   Everything was gone. The birds, the tree, the fruit preserves
and canned green beans, the china plates lovingly accumulated over
half a century, the sweet corn patch, the antique tractor, the
coffee grinder that came into the country in a covered wagon.
   Ralph and Mary Jane Crisman escaped with their lives and one
roll of film.
   ``We'd taken some photographs of the deer in March. There was
snow on the ground and it was cold. It took me until a couple of
weeks ago to use up the roll. It was at the camera store when the
fire came,'' said Crisman.
   ``'Course, it doesn't show the house. We'll just have to try and
remember it in our minds.''

   Pat Wilson felt like he was riding a
borrowed motorcycle into Hell as he raced to save his cattle from a
prairie wildfire sparked by a passing train.
   ``We'd had no moisture, everything was bone-dry. The fire was
moving incredibly fast. Ancient cedar trees were literally blowing
up. It got up into the Missouri Breaks and went wild, totally out
of control. The flames were roaring 30, 40 feet into the air, a
wall of fire was moving 40 miles an hour,'' recalled Wilson.
   ``I arrived in time to see the fire break out of the Badlands
and just explode into country that was as dry as tissue paper. All
it needed was a spark. What we got was a conflagration. It was
incredible, awesome.''
   Wilson is the 40-year-old grandson of a widow who homesteaded a
ranch in 1899 with five children under the age of 12. Like his
grandmother, he is stubborn and determined.
   He's got callouses on his hands, a face stained walnut by the
sun, and the forehead creases of a man trying to support his family
off the land in a time of drought.
   But Wilson is also a dreamer and a poet, a scholar who's just
half a dissertation away from a Ph.D. in American literature from
Syracuse University.
   That dreadful day, with smoke and fire blotting out his vision
and the terrified bawling of cattle ringing in his ears, Wilson
suddenly remembered lines from ``Dream Song 45'' by John Berryman,
the poet featured in his doctoral thesis.
   ``Funny things happen to you when you are part of a disaster.
Thoughts drift by in your head, you think of things you'd never
think of in a million years of normal living,'' Wilson said. ``All
I could think of was that I was staring at ruin, and ruin was
staring back at me, and it was all over.''
   With his wife, Connie, and two of his three children away from
the ranch that Friday, June 10, Wilson tried to save his cows first.
   ``They were starting to come down from the Breaks, away from the
fire,'' he said. ``I ran them into the creek and got them headed
toward the house. The smoke was so black and thick I couldn't see
anything. My lungs were full of it. I got a terrible stomach ache
and got sick.''
   Wilson, making split-second decisions to save his own life,
abandoned the motorcycle because he couldn't see the ground.
Feeling his way on foot, he found a road and hitched a ride home to
grab some valuables. He wanted to help fellow ranchers and
volunteer firefighters from 100 miles around plow and bulldoze fire
lines.
   ``When I got to the house there was pandemonium,'' said Wilson.
``Neighbors were throwing everything they could grab into their
pickups and moving us out.
   ``Connie got here in the middle of it and I turned her around
and got her and the kids out again. The fire was coming right down
the creek.''
   Wilson tried to reach his neighbors Ralph and Mary Jane Crisman
a mile to the east, ``but the bridge was burning and all we could
do was sit there and watch the house go up, so we turned around and
left.''
   ``The real tragedy was Ralph and Mary Jane,'' who are surrogate
grandparents to Wilson's 6-year-old twins, he said. ``The only time
I wanted to cry was when I saw Ralph's evergreen tree burn up. It
was an emblem of how precious life is out here, how much
perseverance it takes to grow a tree in eastern Montana.''
   For three days, Wilson and fellow firefighters battled the
blaze. Twice they thought they had it out; twice it flared up.
Finally, it was over.
   The Wilson home was saved. But blackened pastures and charred,
dead trees surrounded it on three sides.
   Nearly all of Wilson's cattle survived, but 5,000 of his 6,100
acres needed to feed them had burned up and were blowing away.
   ``I'd had just enough grass and water to get me to winter in a
real dry year,'' said Wilson. ``Under normal weather conditions the
fire wouldn't have burned as hot or as fast. With the drought, it
went crazy.''
   Burlington Northern Railroad, acting as claims agent for Amtrak,
whose train sparked the fire, dispatched help to control the blaze.
The railroad also shipped in hay to feed stressed cattle while BN
crews erected emergency fences.
   Averaging three hours of sleep a night, Wilson worked the phone,
trying to find pasture. Ten days after the fire he shipped all but
three of his 300 cows to a North Dakota ranch.
   ``I think it will be OK, the grass seems good and the rancher
said he'd take care of them until I can decide what to do this
fall,'' said Wilson. ``So far I'm about $7,000 out of pocket for
grazing land, trucking, brand inspection and the vet bill. I've
been encouraged by BN's short-term response, but for the long haul
we'll just have to wait and see.''
   John Jacobsen, an Amtrak spokesman in Washington, said there was
no deadline for settling claims. ``It will depend on how
complicated it is,'' said Jacobsen.
   Wilson now agonizes over how badly damaged his land is.
   ``The soil conservation service is advising that these pastures
shouldn't be grazed next year, either,'' said Wilson. ``I have no
hay, no fences, and now no cattle. For the first time since 1899,
there are no Wilson cows on this land and it feels real funny, like
I don't know what to do with myself.''
   In his darkened living room, the drapes pulled tight to keep out
the glaring sun, Wilson paced back and forth and wondered aloud
what he should do next.
   ``I'm going to put this whole place back together _ corral work,
irrigation, cleaning, working in the shop. That's the stuff you
usually do during a rainy day. But we haven't had any of those
lately.
   ``I don't think my sense of loss has kicked in yet, but it will.
I think I can hang on. I hope I can. But this drought has got to
end or we're all finished.''

   Securities pros say the latest insider trading
scheme alleged by the government against a Morgan Stanley & Co.
analyst and a client raises big questions about whether Wall Street
has been properly policing itself in the aftermath of the Ivan
Boesky scandal.
   Securities lawyers and professionals say they are shocked that
Morgan trainee Stephen Wang Jr. could have obtained access to
secrets about corporate takeovers and systematically misused them.
   Washington attorney Paul Fischer said Tuesday that the scheme
``seems to suggest that even the real threat of criminal
prosecution and jail sentences isn't enough to eradicate insider
trading.''

   The suffocating drought in mid-America is taking its toll on
scores of smaller crops _ from cherries to honey _ that could
result in huge losses for thousands of growers.
   Although the spotlight about the drought's impact has focused on
the enormous grain and livestock industries, analysts say the
drought will affect just about everything grown from the Rocky
Mountains east to Ohio.
   The result could be a change in diets and higher prices at
grocery stores, restaurants and taverns.

   Farmers are putting off buying tractors
and delaying equipment repairs because of the drought, just as farm
equipment manufacturers were beginning to enjoy a rebound from an

   Although some say it's too early to gauge the drought's impact
on the industry, others say the uncertainty comes at a bad time.
   George Dahlman, an analyst who follows the farm equipment
industry for the Minneapolis securities firm of Piper Jaffrey &

   Contracts for unleaded gasoline, spurred by the
summer driving season, posted the only gains in an otherwise dull
oil market.
   While contracts for other products fell on Tuesday, the July
contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.48 to 51.53 cents a gallon.
Most longer term contracts were lower, however.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, fell 8 cents to $15.78 per barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Among other refined products traded on the exchange, the July
contract for home heating oil slipped 0.28 cent to 42.31 cents a
gallon.
   Traders said activity was somewhat dull on Tuesday. ``There's
not a whole lot going on,'' said William Byers of futures research
at Bear Stearns & Co.
   The gains posted in near-term contracts for unleaded gasoline
are typical of the summer driving season, particularly ahead of the
long Independence Day weekend, traders said.
   ``This is a gas-oriented market,'' said Madison Galbraith, a
trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Galbraith also said traders were awaiting the release of the
latest statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, issued
after the market closed, to see if supplies had declined enough to
justify the rising price in the near-term gasoline contract.
   The API report showed a larger-than-expected drop in gasoline
stocks, and a decline in crude oil stocks.
   Among other contracts, traders noted there was a late wave of
profit-taking that brought both crude and heating oil down shortly
before the market closed.
   ``People don't see what will happen to make the market go up,
but they're not overwhelmingly negative, either,'' Byers said.

<HEAD>Company Wants To Use Computer Chip Against Killer Bees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tiny computer chip that can be glued to
the bodies of ``killer bees'' to track their movements may help
control migration of the pests into the United States, according to
the defense contractor designing the device.
   Engineers for Martin Marietta, known for its production of MX
missiles and laser-guided artillery shells, developed the
sophisticated tracking chip at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
Oak Ridge, Tenn., the company said Tuesday.
   The microchip, about the size of a half-carat diamond and
weighing about as much as a grain of salt, is part of an integrated
circuit that would be attached to the midsections of captured bees.
   The device is powered by nine solar cells and will transmit an
infrared signal that can be picked up by a ground station up to a
mile away.
   A captured bee would have the device to be glued to its body and
then be set free, a spokesman said. The transmitters may have to be
attached to hundereds or thousands of bees.
   ``What we've done so far...is establish that the bee could
indeed fly with the chip'' attached, said Ed Aebischer, a spokesman
at the laboratory. ``The entomologists have looked at it and
they're convinced that it's workable.''
   A working killer bee transmitter is expected to be put in the
field by next year.
   Martin Marietta engineers plan to use the device to monitor the
mating and foraging habits of the creatures, known as killer bees
because of their aggressiveness.
   The bees are descendants of African queen bees. Hundreds of
thousands of the bees have been heading north from Brazil since
they accidentally escaped from a laboratory in 1957.
   They have killed 350 people since 1957, said Ralph Bram, an
official with the U.S. Agricultural Research Service. The killer
bees have migrated as far as southern Mexico, and Bram estimates
they could cross into Texas as early as next year.
   Scientists hope that by being able to track the insects they can
control the migration without using large quantities of pesticides.
   ``The bees pose a threat to the $20 billion annual production of
U.S. agricultural crops requiring bee pollination,'' said Diedre
Falter, one of the chip's developers. ``The microchip should be
able to help combat this potentially very serious situation.''
   Martin Marietta operates the Oak Ridge laboratory under a
government contract. Last year, the company developed a hand-held,
electronic detector that allowed scientists and beekeepers to
distinguish between Africanized bees and the domestic species by
the different sounds they make.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Launches Ad Campaign Touting Economic Clout of

<TEXT>
   The nation's biggest tobacco maker is touting
the economic muscle of smokers in a multimillion-dollar advertising
campaign, but a longtime smoking critic faults the ads for failing
to mention smoking's economic costs.
   The ad campaign is being sponsored by Philip Morris Magazine,
published by Philip Morris USA, which makes Marlboro, Virginia
Slims and Merit cigarettes.
   The first ad, placed Tuesday in 19 daily newspapers across the
country, carried the headline ``$1 trillion is too much financial
power to ignore.''
   The figure is based on findings from the polling concern Roper
Organization which said it reflects the combined household income
of the 55.8 million American smokers.
   Roper interviewed a nationally-representative sample of 2,000
people about a number of issues, including smoking habits, for
Philip Morris.
   But Irving Rimer of the American Cancer Society said the
campaign ``left out the other half of the story and that is
smoking's costs to the economy.''
   Rimer said smoking costs the economy an estimated $65 billion
annually in terms of lost productivity and treatment of
smoking-related diseases.
   The new campaign comes amid widening efforts to ban smoking in
public places.
   It also appears two weeks after a jury in Newark, N.J., held
another cigarette maker, Liggett Group Inc., partly responsible for
a smoker's lung cancer, the first such finding in 30 years. The
same jury cleared Liggett, Philip Morris Inc. and another tobacco
concern, Lorillard Inc., of conspiring to mislead the public about
the risks of smoking.
   Guy L. Smith, publisher of Philip Morris Magazine, said the
timing of the ad campaign had nothing to do with publicity about
the verdict against Liggett.
   He said subsequent ads will appear in about 30 trade magazines
over the next six months and point out what Roper found about the
travel, dining, shopping and entertainment habits of Americans who
smoke.
   ``More than 24 million of this country's smokers will travel
this summer. Make room, America,'' one ad says. ``America's smokers
attend enough sporting events each year to fill the Astrodome 3,200
times,'' another ad states.
   Smith said the ads are designed to reach leaders in a variety of
industries to make them aware of how much money smokers spend.
   ``The economic strength of this group has been overlooked or
understated for far too long,'' Smith told a news conference.
   He said one ad, indicating U.S. smokers own 35 million cars and
bought more than 5 million new cars last year, was designed to
reach automobile industry leaders. ``Enough cars to stretch
bumper-to-bumper around the world four times is too much horsepower
to ignore,'' the ad states.
   Smith said the auto industry was singled out because some
opponents of smoking have reportedly suggested that automakers
remove ash trays from cars.
   ``We want automobile manufacturers, for instance, to at least
think before taking action that will discriminate against a large
segment of their employees, their customers and their vendors,''
Smith said. ``The time has come when smokers will not sit passively
and have their rights trampled.''
   The Cancer Society's Rimer the campaign demonstrates the tobacco
industry is in trouble. ``They are trying to create an army out of
cigarette smokers who have no other connection ... I think they are
desperate,'' he said.
   Separately, Philip Morris released results of a survey of the
readers of its magazine, and said they were generally above average
in terms of income, education and political activity.
   Nearly three-fourths of the respondents said they smoked, Smith
said.
   Philip Morris put the four-page survey in the winter issue of
its magazine, which was mailed for free to 8.2 million households.
More than 408,000 completed replies came back, Smith said.

   Motown Records, which launched the careers of
such singers as Diana Ross, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder and
won a huge and enduring white audience for black pop music, has
been sold to a unit of entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc.
   The $61 million deal announced Tuesday gives MCA Records the
famed Motown label and rights to a string of hit songs dating back
to the early 1960s, such as ``I Heard it Through the Grapevine''
and ``Baby Love.''
   MCA also will assume Motown's current recording contracts with
such stars as Lionel Richie, Smokey Robinson and Wonder.
   Berry Gordy Jr., the former Detroit auto worker who founded
Motown and built it into what was once the nation's biggest
black-owned business, retains the company's sheet music and film
divisions, said Motown spokeswoman Rosalind Stevenson.
   MCA Inc. put up 20 percent of the purchase price and Boston
Ventures, an investment banking firm, will supply the remainder,
Ms. Stevenson said. The deal calls for MCA to buy out Boston
Ventures' share in the future, she said.
   MCA officials announced the long-rumored deal had been completed
but refused to discuss the terms. Ms. Stevenson and another source
familiar with the talks who refused to be identified confirmed the
$61 million purchase price.
   ``In today's economy, the big get bigger and the small get
extinct,'' Gordy said, explaining the necessity for the sale in
Tuesday's editions of the entertainment paper Daily Variety.
   ``In order to prevent that from happening, and to ensure the
perpetuation of Motown and its heritage, I decided to clasp hands
with one of the most formidable giants in our business, MCA,''
Gordy said.
   In the 1960s, Motown, named for its ``Motor Town'' roots in
Detroit, discovered and molded a lineup of black recording artists
and churned out a line of songs that topped pop charts for both
black and white audiences.
   For many, the harmonies and images of Motown's acts are woven
into the cultural backdrop of the 1960s: Diana Ross and the
Supremes singing ``Baby Love,'' ``Love Child'' and ``Stop! In the
Name of Love;'' the Temptations' ``My Girl;'' the Four Tops' ``I
Can't Help Myself;'' and Marvin Gaye's ``I Heard it Through the
Grapevine.''
   Michael Jackson began his musical career with Motown as a child
member of the Jackson Five.
   Wonder, whose hits on Motown-allied labels include the 1973
chart-toppers ``Superstition'' and ``You Are the Sunshine of My
Life,'' agreed to stay on under MCA before the sale went through,
said the source familiar with the negotiations.
   Diana Ross, who in her solo career has recorded with RCA, signed
with MCA previous to the deal and will return to the Motown label,
Ms. Stevenson said.
   Gordy formed Motown in 1960 and moved it to Los Angles 1971.
Gordy, who worked as talent scout, arranger and producer, ran the
company like a stern father, demanding loyalty and also encouraging
his performers to finish high school, though he made it only
through 11th grade.
   Privately-owned Motown was the nation's most visible black
business and at one time its biggest. Last year, Motown was the

<HEAD>House Debates $10.8 Billion Transportation Spending Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: House debate resumes at 10 a.m. EDT; time for final passage
uncertain. A version moving on general news wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The House is moving toward final passage of a
bill providing $10.8 billion in new spending for the government's
transportation programs for fiscal 1989, despite a Reagan
administration veto threat.
   Approval of the legislation was expected today, even though
administration officials say rejection of the measure by President
Reagan is possible because it is too expensive.
   The legislation would provide $2 billion above the amount Reagan
requested for transportation programs for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1, and $182 million over the amount provided for this
year. It contains large increases for the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Coast Guard.
   The bill would also allow the government to spend up to an
additional $15.4 billion out of revenues collected each year
specifically for aviation, highway and mass transit programs.
   As usual, the bill also contains a number of highway projects
and other items aimed at particular districts.
   Altogether, the measure would allow $3.1 billion in spending for
the Coast Guard, a 16 percent increase over 1988 levels. At least
$492 million would have to be spent on drug interdiction efforts.
   The Federal Aviation Administration would be entitled to spend
more than $6.6 billion, 15 percent more than this year. Most of the
money would be for the salaries of air traffic controllers and
other workers, new equipment such as radar, and grants to airports
for construction.
   Amtrak, the federally subsidized passenger railroad, would
receive $590 million and mass transit programs would get $3.3
billion.
   It was for those programs that lawmakers differed most radically
from Reagan's proposed budget. The president wanted to terminate
all federal aid to Amtrak, which expects to carry 34 million
passengers next year, and provide mass transit programs with barely
half the amount the House approved.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $10.6 billion
version of the bill last Friday. When the full Senate passes that
legislation, the two chambers will have to agree to a compromise
bill before it is sent to Reagan for his signature.
   When debate on the House bill began Tuesday, lawmakers removed
provisions that might have blocked federal aid to Boston's Logan
International Airport.
   Officials at Logan plan to increase landing fees July 1 for
small aircraft, which they say would reduce delays for airline
passengers by encouraging private and commuter planes to use nearby
airfields. The program is supported by Boston-area legislators.
   Opponents inserted a provision that would have withheld federal
assistance to Logan until the Department of Transportation
completes an investigation of Logan's plan, and until the courts
rule on challenges filed by small aircraft industry groups.
   The provision was removed on procedural grounds, however, after
Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., complained that by House rules,
it should not have been included in a spending bill. Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., who was presiding over the House at the time,
upheld Kennedy's objection. There was no vote.
   Similar provisions blocking aid to Logan remain in the Senate
version of the transportation bill.
   The House bill would also attempt to block a private developer's
plans to build a shopping mall in Manassas, Va., on part of what
was the scene of the Second Battle of Bull Run, a Confederate
victory during the Civil War. The provision, introduced by Civil
War buff Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., would forbid the government to
approve the construction of exits from highways that serve the area.

   J.C. Penney Co. has purchased the three
suburban Cincinnati stores vacated earlier this month by L.S. Ayres
& Co., a move that Penney says will double its presence in the
Cincinnati area.
   ``Cincinnati has long represented a really stable economic
market, the kind of market that has been good for J.C. Penney,''
Hank Rusman, a Penney's spokesman, said Tuesday.
   Agreement on the sale was reached Tuesday between Penney and May
Department Stores Co., Ayres' parent company. Terms of the sale
were not disclosed.
   May officials shut the three suburban stores June 6 after the
downtown Ayres store was closed in April. Ayres has 14 other stores
in Indiana.
   Dallas-based Penney also announced it will close its 68-year-old
store in Hamilton this fall shortly before the three suburban
stores are expected to open.
   All displaced employees will be offered jobs in Penney's new
stores, which the company said will employ an estimated 400 people.

<HEAD>GM Executive Reshuffling Helps Prepare New Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith says a
major reshuffling of top-level management will help train and
prepare a new generation to run the world's largest automaker in
the next century.
   Smith announced promotions Tuesday of more than a dozen top
executives, including three new executive vice presidents, in the
wake of Monday's resignation of Elmer Johnson, a GM director and
executive vice president in charge of GM's operating, legal and
public affairs staffs.
   Johnson, a rare high-level outsider who joined GM just five
years ago, once was considered a contender to replace Smith when
the chairman retires in 1990.
   Smith said Tuesday GM had been planning the moves for more than
a year but accelerated the changes when Johnson resigned. Smith
disputed reports that Johnson was frustrated in efforts to lighten
GM's ponderous bureaucracy and in his ambition to succeed Smith.
   The moves, which widened the pool of Smith's potential
successors, affected 14 GM executives.
   ``We have elected three new executive vice presidents which we
think will significantly strengthen our organization and prepare us
better for the 21st century as we move forward,'' Smith said.
   ``One of our corporation's greatest strengths has been the depth
of our people ... but people always need broader assignments,
different training,'' he said.
   Smith also announced the formation of the new Power Products and
Defense Operations Group, which will centralize direction of
several non-automotive divisions that build diesel and locomotive
engines and defense vehicles.
   Johnson's executive assignments were divided among several top
executives, but he was not replaced on the board of directors.
   The three new executive vice presidents are William E. Hoglund,
53; John F. Smith Jr., 50; and Robert T. O'Connell, 49.
   Hoglund, who was vice president and group executive in charge of
GM's Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group, is now in charge of GM's
Automotive Components Groups and the new Power Products and Defense
Operations Group.
   ``It's just a typical round of management changes,'' said Chris
Cedergren, analyst with J.D. Power and Associates in Agoura Hills,
Calif.
   ``(Hoglund) did a really fine job in that particular area. I'm
kind of saddened, because I like to see people who are real good in
the car business stay in the business.''
   But, Cedergren said, in order to move up, Hoglund and others
``have to go through the various ranks and various divisions.''
   ``It's kind of interesting because it widens the field up a
little bit and falls in line with a strategy GM used to have that
they have three people to replace any key job,'' said analyst
Thomas O'Grady, a former GM economist.
   Hoglund is succeeded in his old job by J.T. Battenberg III, 45,
who was manager of the B-O-C Flint Automotive Division and is now a
vice president.
   John Smith, who was a GM vice president and president of General
Motors Europe, is now in charge of all GM overseas operations _ the
first time GM has had an executive vice president whose sole
responsibility is overseas business, the primary source of GM's
1987 profits.
   Smith is succeeded as president of GM Europe by Robert J. Eaton,
48, a vice president and group executive of GM's Technical Staffs
Group.
   The responsibilities of O'Connell, who was vice president and
group executive of GM's Finance Group, were expanded with his new
title. He now also is in charge of General Motors Acceptance Corp.,
GM's lending arm.
   Two of Johnson's executive assignments were given to F. Alan
Smith, 57, who had been the executive vice president in charge of
the Finance Group and GMAC. Smith is now in charge of GM's
operating and public affairs staffs.
   Other executives were moved up to fill vacancies left by the
promotions.

<HEAD>Singapore Economy To Remain Fairly Strong: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singapore's economy will probably maintain its
8 percent annual growth rate this year despite problems posed by
labor shortages, according to a U.S. Embassy report released
Wednesday.
   The nation's economy is dependent on foreign trade and continues
to recover due to strong export demand in the United States and
other industrialized countries, the report said.
   The economy stumbled into recession in 1985 and partially
recovered with a 1.8 percent growth rate in 1986, which surged to
8.8 percent last year.
   Domestic demand, an increase in tourism and the recovery of the
neighboring Indonesian and Malaysian economies boosted the island's
trade and economic growth last year, according to the embassy
report.
   But ``despite a favorable demand outlook for Singapore's goods
and services for the rest of 1988, persistent labor shortages are
causing many manufacturers to consider delaying new investment
projects,'' the report said.
   ``The outlook for the economy beyond 1988 depends heavily on the
health of Singapore's trading partners,'' it said. ``Global
economic uncertainties, the threat of protectionism and strained
political relations could cloud Singapor's investment climate.''

<HEAD>Index Down Slightly; Economists Not Concerned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported today that its chief
economic forecasting gauge edged down 0.1 percent in May, but
analysts said the slight dip did not signal economic troubles ahead.
   The Commerce Department said the decline in its Index of Leading
Economic Indicators was the first setback since a 0.2 percent drop
in January.
   While reporting the decline for May, however, the government
revised its estimate of April economic activity upward to show an
increase of 0.5 percent in the leading index, instead of the 0.2
percent gain originally reported.
   Analysts said even with the slight setback in May, which had
been expected, the forecasting gauge is still flashing signals that
the economy is on an upward trend.
   The economists said there was ample, widespread evidence that
the economy is maintaining its forward momentum.
   The Reagan administration last week boosted its economic
forecast to predict growth, as measured by the gross national
product, of 3 percent this year, a significant revision from a
February forecast that put growth at a 2.4 percent rate.
   In May, the biggest single factor holding the leading index back
was a decline in stock prices. Without a 2.5 percent decline in the
value of the Standard & Poor 500-stock compilation, the leading
index would have registered a 0.1 percent increase for the month.
   Four other business barometers also showed weakness during the
month. Following stock prices, the biggest negative factors were a
drop in plant and equipment orders, a rise in weekly unemployment
claims, a drop in the length of the average workweek and a fall in
building permits.
   Four of the available nine indicators made positive
contributions to the index. The biggest positive force was a
slowdown in business deliveries from suppliers. This is seen as a
sign of rising demand and is thus viewed as a good sign for future
economic activity.
   Other positive forces were a rise in manufacturers' orders for
consumer goods, a rise in raw materials prices, also viewed as a
positive by the index, and an increase in the money supply.
   The various changes left the index at 192.6 percent of its 1967
base of 100.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington economic consulting firm,
said the economy is really doing better than the leading index
would suggest because much of the growth this year has come from a
surge in export sales, which the index does not track very well.
   ``Exports are moving us along and will continue to move us along
for the rest of the year,'' he said.
   Some economists have begun to express concerns that the drought
in the Midwest will boost inflation this year because of higher
food prices.
   But Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economist, said last
week the administration was sticking by its forecast that consumer
prices would rise only 4.5 percent this year, little changed from
last year's inflation rate.
   The increase in the administration's GNP forecast was in line
with the expectations of many private economists, who have been
busy adjusting their forecasts to take into account surprisingly
strong growth in the first three months of this year.
   Immediately following the October stock market collapse, some
analysts had predicted the United States would enter a recession in
the early part of 1988. Instead, GNP growth raced ahead at a 3.6
percent rate annual rate from January through March.
   Frank McCormick, senior economist at the Bank of America in San
Francisco, said he was looking for GNP growth in the current
quarter at essentially the same brisk pace as the first three
months of the year with only a modest slowdown in the last half of
the year.
   ``The stock market took a huge dive in October, but it didn't
turn out to be a very good predictor of where the economy was
headed,'' he said.

   The stock market headed higher today in a bid to
extend Tuesday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.87 to 2,136.74 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 557 up, 331 down and
505 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.88 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market continued to benefit from expectations
of a continuing rally by the dollar in foreign exchange.
   A steady to stronger dollar would presumably attract money from
overseas investors to both stocks and bonds traded in the United
States.
   Worries over upward pressure on commodity prices eased,
meanwhile, after Tuesday's rain in much of the Midwest.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up ~ at 127~; DuPont, up { at 91[; American Telephone &
Telegraph, up [ at 26~, and General Electric, up [ at 43{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.33 to 154.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .09 at 308.51.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.41 to
2,130.87.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 966 up, 515 down and 482 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 152.37 million shares, against 264.41 million Monday, when
the total was inflated by dividend-related activity in several
high-yielding issues.

<HEAD>First RepublicBank's Restructuring Plan Best, Chairman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By READ MARTIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First RepublicBank Corp. has told shareholders it
will suffer another substantial loss in the current quarter because
the Texas real estate market has not bottomed out.
   Meanwhile, the bank holding company was waiting to see if it
would receive a buyout bid from Citicorp. First RepublicBank
Chairman Albert Casey said Citicorp might submit a restructuring
plan for the company with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   ``(Citicorp) won't tell me if they're going to submit (a
proposal),'' First RepublicBank Chairman Albert Casey said.
   First RepublicBank submitted its own restructuring proposal June
9. The deadline for submission of a proposal is Thursday, and Casey
said the FDIC should select a plan shortly after July 8.
   A First RepublicBank internal memo distributed Monday indicated
Citicorp officials were examining First RepublicBank's books and
financial condition. Citicorp officials declined to comment on
whether they plan to purchase First RepublicBank, the state's
largest bank holding company.
   Citicorp, which held $203 billion of assets at March 31, earned
$358 million during the first quarter of 1988. Citicorp lost $1.14
billion in 1987, largely as the result of large provision for
possible losses on its $12.9 billion portfolio of Latin American
loans.
   First RepublicBank lost $1.5 billion in the first quarter,
prompting a $1 billion bailout earlier this year from the FDIC. The
company has been hit by a string of real estate loans that turned
sour.
   ``The complete disappearance of the real estate market was
unforeseen by anybody,'' Casey said in discussing the company's
problems.
   ``On the second (quarter), we're going to continue to record
further losses,'' Casey said. ``Those losses are primarily made up
of additional loan loss provisions and reductions in the assets by
reasons of continuing new appraisals of the collateral. Both of
those items are still hitting us.''
   Hundreds of loan reappraisals now under way made it impossible
for him to estimate second quarter results in dollar figures,
although the loss would be less than the first quarter, he said.
   ``We have not bottomed out in the real estate market yet, as far
as I can tell,'' Casey said.
   Under First RepublicBank's reorganization proposal, shareholders
would be compensated with a modest but as-yet undetermined amount
of stock in the bank that emerged from the restructuring, Casey
said.
   Casey said a First RepublicBank plan will seek to repay the
FDIC's $1 billion loan.
   If First RepublicBank's reorganization plan is accepted, it
would file registration papers for new securities offerings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in August.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors launched a ``surgical''
strike against the nation's largest labor union, announcing a
racketeering lawsuit to break the Mafia's alleged domination of the
Teamsters.
   Spokesmen for the 1.6 million-member union called the civil
racketeering suit ``a vicious anti-labor attack'' and said
allegations of ties to organized crime were ``pure myth.''
   Hours after the lawsuit was filed Tuesday here, Teamsters
president Jackie Presser was readmitted to a Cleveland hospital,
where he was in serious condition today. Presser had brain tumor
surgery last month.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani stressed that ``this lawsuit is
not in any sense an attack on trade unionism or on the many, many
Teamsters who are honest, hard-working people.''
   ``We are not seeking overall control of the Teamsters union,''
Giuliani said. ``This is a use of the racketeering statute in a
surgical way to attempt to take back from the Mafia the Teamsters
union.''
   Giuliani and Teamsters lawyer John Climaco sparred over the suit
on morning news shows today. The two shouted at each other on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, and on CBS-TV's ``This Morning,'' each
accused the other side of un-American activities.
   ``That's the political demagoguery and posturing that goes on in
a situation like this. ... It is not un-American to try to have a
union operated democratically rather than tyranically. It seems to
me it's un-American to let that go on year after year, decade after
decade,'' Giuliani said.
   Climaco acknowledged that there are ``individual associations''
between Teamsters and organized crime, but he insisted that ``the
Teamsters union doesn't condone corruption'' or ``criminal
activity.''
   The suit is ``un-American, it's contrary to our philosophy of
government'' and American labor policy, Climaco said.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit charged that Teamsters leaders
made ``a devil's pact'' with the Mafia, insuring the elections of
top officers, including Presser and his predecessor, Roy Williams.
   Organized crime ``has deprived union members of their rights
through a pattern of racketeering that includes 20 murders, a
number of shootings, bombings, beatings, a campaign of fear,
extortion and theft and misuses of union funds,'' Giuliani said.
   Court papers noted that four of the last five Teamsters
presidents have faced federal felony charges and three were
convicted: David Beck for embezzlement; James ``Jimmy'' Hoffa for
obstructing justice and mail fraud, and Williams for trying to
bribe a U.S. senator.
   The government wants a federal judge to remove from office any
Teamsters officers found to have violated federal racketeering
laws. It also seeks appointment of a union trustee to ensure fair
union elections.
   Named as defendants were: the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters; its general executive board as a group; the executive
board's 18 members and one former member as individuals; 26 alleged
members or associates of the Mafia; and the mob's ruling
``Commission'' as a group.
   Twenty-five of those 26 defendants have been convicted of
Teamsters-related crimes such as labor peace extortion, embezzling
union funds or taking labor payoffs. The board consists of Presser;
Weldon Mathis, the secretary-treasurer and acting president; and 16
vice presidents.
   Judge David N. Edelstein granted the government a temporary
restraining order that bars the board from making large
expenditures of union funds or destroying union records. The order
also banned the 25 previously convicted mob defendants from
participating in union affairs.
   A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.
   Prosecutors have used the federal racketeering laws to uproot
corruption in union locals and businesses, but it was the first
time the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act was used
against an entire union.
   Mathis condemned the lawsuit as ``a vicious anti-labor attack.''
Two U.S. senators and the AFL-CIO, of which the Teamsters is a
member, said the lawsuit overstepped government authority.
   The AFL-CIO, which the Teamsters rejoined in October after 30
years, issued a statement calling it ``a clear abuse of the
government's prosecutorial power and ... if sustained, would
undermine a free trade union movement.''
   ``It's pure myth that this organization is in any way influenced
or controlled by organized crime,'' Climaco said at a news
conference in Montreal.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee, said the suit sets ``a
terrible precedent.''
   ``I don't think the government or any court in this nation is
capable of being a trustee over a union,'' he said.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., also criticized the move.
   At the Justice Department, Attorney General Edwin Meese III
called the lawsuit ``a very carefully developed, you might call it
almost legally surgical step to remove the corrupt influences from
the Teamsters.''
   Meese said he had no apologies for President Reagan's acceptance
of Teamsters support in the 1980 presidential campaign, saying
there had been no evidence at the time of any links to organized
crime.
   Among the 26 alleged Mafia members or associates named in the
civil action were the reputed heads of six mob families in New
York, Chicago and Milwaukee.
   They included convicted crime family boss Anthony ``Fat Tony''
Salerno of the Genovese group who was convicted in 1986 of sitting
on the ``commission'' that ruled the U.S. Mafia since Prohibition.

   Federal marshals temporarily have moved Ivan
Boesky from a California prison back to New York, raising
speculation that the disgraced Wall Street speculator will testify
against others he has implicated in a massive insider trading
scandal.
   Boesky was transferred from a minimum-security prison camp in
Lompoc, Calif., to the Metropolitan Correctional Facility in
Manhattan June 23, Joseph Fitzmaurice, a Lompoc correctional
officer, said Tuesday in a telephone interview.
   Robert Palmquist, a paralegal specialist in the warden's office
at Lompoc, said marshals accompanied Boesky on a federal writ. That
means Boesky was likely to testify in an unspecified proceeding.
   The officials said they did not know the exact reason for the
transfer, although Palmquist said it was temporary.
   ``He will eventually come back to this facility,'' Palmquist
said.
   Federal prosecutors in New York said they could not comment on
the transfer. Asked if he could explain why Boesky was moved,
assistant U.S. attorney John Carroll said, ``No, I can't.''
   Boesky attorneys Theodore Levine and Robert McCaw were out of
their Washington office Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment, a secretary there said.
   Boesky stunned the financial world in November 1986 by paying
the Securities and Exchange Commission a record $100 million to
settle charges of insider trading, the misuse of confidential
information to profit from securities transactions.
   He agreed to cooperate in a major government probe into Wall
Street corruption and has supplied extensive information that has
implicated others. In exchange, he was allowed to plead guilty to a
single criminal charge of conspiracy to lie to the SEC and received
a three-year prison term in December. He began serving the term in
March at Lompoc, a former U.S. army barracks about 140 miles
west-northwest of Los Angeles.
   In April, Boesky's attorneys asked U.S. District Judge Morris
Lasker, who sentenced Boesky, to reduce the punishment on grounds
that the speculator's cooperation was much broader and deeper than
originally foreseen.
   In a lengthy written plea for leniency, the attorneys said the
value of the information provided by Boesky ``will become een more
evident than it was at sentencing, or than it can be now.''
   Boesky's cooperation has resulted in more than 19 criminal and
civil cases, including four convictions in the United States, seven
pending indictments in Britain, nine SEC civil actions and more
than $134 million in returned profits and penalties, the lawyers
argued.
   They also asked Lasker to withhold a decision on their plea
until October, which suggested that new indictments stemming from
Boesky's disclosures could result by then.

<HEAD>Group Forecasts Rubber Deficit, Due Partly To AIDS Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World consumption of natural rubber is expected to
grow much faster than production in 1988, leading to the biggest
deficit this decade, the International Rubber Study Group said
Wednesday.
   The producer-consumer statistical group put consumption at a
record 4.935 million metric tons in 1988, which would be 140,000
tons more than the forecast for record production of 4.795 million.
   Last year, consumption exceeded production by 55,000 tons. The
group also is projecting a deficit of 125,000 tons for 1989, based
on a production forecast of 4.965 million and consumption of 5.090
million.
   Traders said the increasing shortfall in world supplies has
pushed average world natural rubber prices up to their highest
level for about eight years, with the latex grade trading at record
levels of above $1,000 a ton.
   Demand for latex, which is used for surgical gloves and condoms,
has been stimulated by the AIDS crisis, analysts said. ``Dentists
now more and more use a new pair of rubber-dipped gloves for every
patient examined,'' said one analyst.

   Yugo American said starting today it is offering

   Yugo American President William E. Prior said buyers will
receive $750, either in cash or toward down payments on the

   That is a 17 percent rebate on the basic $4,349 Yugo GV and 16

   Sales of the Yugo, which climbed after introduction in the
United States in August 1985 at a base price of $3,990, have sagged
this year.
   Yugo reported selling 2,510 cars in May, a 39 percent drop from
4,111 a year ago. For the year through May 31, the company sold
14,531 cars, down 35 percent from 22,272 in the first five months
of 1987.

<HEAD>Study Shows Tannery Workers Have High Rates Of Testicular Cancer</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto AB1 of June 28</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For the past 25 years, James Gray has
labored in one of this city's tanneries, where workers sling
rubbery white sheepskins over wooden stands and then treat, cut and
color the skins with the touch of master craftsmen.
   He never worried that his job could one day make him sick.
   Now he does, since a state study showed tannery workers have an
increased risk of getting testicular cancer.
   The study released by the New York state Department of Health
has found that more than half of Fulton County's testicular cancer
victims between 1974 and 1986 had worked in tanneries.
   ``It's not a chance finding,'' said Dr. James Melius, director
of the Division of Occupational Health and Environmental
Epidemiology. ``People in the leather industry have an increased
risk of getting testicular cancer.''
   State officials suspect the chemical solvent dimethlyformamide,
or DMF, is a possible cause of the cancer. The connection has yet
to be proven, but while tests continue, the tanning companies have
stopped using DMF to help dyes seep into leather.
   The health scare comes at a time when the tanning industry here
has already fallen on hard times. Cheaper imports have shut down
hundreds of operations, forcing the layoffs of thousands of workers
and cutting the wages of those who have managed to hang on to their
jobs.
   Despite the downturn, New York remains the nation's leading
tanning and glovemaking state _ ahead of Wisconsin, Maine,
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania _ and more than two-thirds of the
industry's work force is in Fulton County.
   The leather industry in the United States traces its roots back
to 1853, when members of the Glovers' Guild of Perth, Scotland,
founded the industry that gave Gloversville its name.
   By 1892 there were 140 glove manufacturers and 52 tanneries in
Fulton County. During a boom period in the 1940s, the cities
produced an estimated 95 percent of all leather gloves worn in
America. More than 5,000 workers, 20 percent of the county's
population, had jobs in one of the cities' 75 tanneries.
   Today, approximately 13,000 people are still employed in
tanneries across the country, according to the U.S. Department of
Labor. In New York, the industry has shrunk to under 500 workers
and only 17 tanneries still operate in Fulton County. Most firms
have moved to the Far East to take advantage of low wages for the
highly labor-intensive process.
   Fulton County's unemployment rate, at 9.2 percent, is more than
double the state average, making it one of the most economically
depressed areas in New York. The toll can be seen on Gloversville's
Main Street, where blocks of empty stores, many with broken
windows, line the city's main thoroughfare.
   The situation leaves area workers torn between the need for jobs
and concern about their health. People need a job, even one that
could give them cancer, said William Towne, manager of the Glove
Cities Area Joint Board of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union.
   ``There's nowhere else for them to go,'' he said. ``For a long
time, fear of losing a job has been greater than fear of cancer.''
   Richard Handy, who spent 13 years working at Gloversville's Pan
American Tanning Corp., including shifts on a spray line where the
suspected cancer-causing DMF was used, agreed.
   ``There's high unemployment there and we don't have any place
else to get a job,'' he said during a recent legislative hearing in
the state capital on hazardous working environments. ``We have to
have a job to provide for our families.''
   Handy doesn't have testicular cancer, but he has developed
cancer of the larynx. He blames chemicals used in the tanneries for
his illness.
   Both Handy and Towne say workers do want safer working
conditions. But at the same time they believe workers feel that if
they place too much pressure on their employers, tannery owners
will pack up and leave, taking much-needed jobs with them.
   At this point, state health officials emphasize that DMF is only
a suspected cause of the cancer. However, they say they're highly
suspicious of the chemical because out of the seven tannery workers
who have contracted the disease since 1974, five worked at the Pan
American spray line where DMF was used. A total of 10 Fulton County
men have contracted testicular cancer since 1974.
   ``We're suspicious there's a link between testicular cancer and
DMF, but it hasn't been definitely proven yet,'' Melius said.
``Tannery workers are exposed to so many toxic chemicals.''
   An attorney for the local Tanners Association also notes the
lack of conclusive evidence.
   ``We understand that from all the data given to us that there's
no conclusion,'' attorney Frederick R. Stortecky said.
   But tannery owners say they no longer use the chemical.
   ``I think the industry has been responsive to new environmental
concerns,'' said Tom Nickerson, president of the Wood and Hyde
Leather Corp. ``They responded as new information became known.''
   Melius said health officials have told workers that even though
DMF might not be used in tanneries anymore, men who had been
exposed to the chemical may be at risk of contracting the disease
for up to 40 years.
   Testicular cancer usually strikes men in their 20s and 30s, but
older men can also get the disease, Melius said. If treated early,
the cancer is curable, he said.
   Use of DMF is not limited to just the tanning industry. The
chemical, which is manufactured by Du Pont Co., is used widely in
the aircraft industry as well. Du Pont officials say a recent study
conducted by their company shows no evidence linking DMF with
testicular cancer.
   The study included 8,700 employees who worked over a 30-year
period at one of the company's four plants that either manufactures
or uses the chemical, said Kathy Forte, a company spokeswoman,
adding that Du Pont does require that all employees be vigorously
protected against exposure to chemicals on the job.
   The results of Du Pont's two-year study were released in May and
are now being reviewed by the National Institute of Occupational
Safety and Hazard.
   The institute is also conducting a study of its own,
specifically to find out if DMF actually causes testicular cancer.
The results of the study should be released by the end of the year.
   Meanwhile, people like Towne are trying to make the best of the
industry's plight.
   ``It's depressing at times,'' the union manager said as he gazed
out onto Main Street from his office. ``But for the leather
industry, we've seen our attrition. What's here will be here for a
while.''

<HEAD>Swedish Company Celebrates 700th Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FALUN, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what could be an early case of insider
trading, Bishop Peter of Vasteras in 1288 traded land and fishing
rights for a one-eighth interest in the Great Copper Mountain
Mining Co.
   The deed of purchase from that deal lays the basis for the
firm's claim to be world's oldest continuously operating company.
   Today, the 700-year-old firm _ Stora Kopparberg AB in Swedish _
is undergoing an expansion program that is typical of the
aggressive style of Swedish business facing increasing competition
for access to European markets.
   As it marks its birthday, the company is celebrating its success
at shedding less productive businesses and establishing itself as a
world power in forest products.
   Some 9,000 shareholders are noting the seven-century mark this
summer with parties, sporting events and a shareholders meeting in
the mine's 300-foot-deep open pit.
   Stora reportedly is spending up to $16 million on the birthday,
including invitations this year to its 22,000 employees to visit
the company's headquarters in this town in central Sweden.
   The mine had already existed for some 200 years and had provided
swords for Viking raiders when Bishop Peter bought into the company
back in the 13th century. He apparently was acting on a tip from
monks in Europe of a technological advance in water wheels that
could be used for power in the mine and greatly increase profits.
   The mine was the source of wealth for the Swedish empire during
the 17th century. Now Stora is devoted mostly to paper and pulp
production, and the mine in the mountains outside Falun is kept
open more for sentimental than for economic reasons.
   ``After 700 years, we don't want to be the ones to close the
mine,'' said Tommy Forss, curator of a small company museum.
   Stora owns forests half the size of Belgium, produces enough
liquid packaging board to make two milk cartons for every person in
the world, and makes newsprint for Sweden's newspapers and for some
of Europe's largest dailies.
   A restructuring plan begun 10 years ago disposed of the
company's steel interests and diversified its forest-products
holdings. Since 1984, it has acquired leading manufacturers of
board, packaging and fine papers. Stora president Bo Berggren and
board chairman Peter Wallenberg are credited with the success of
the transformation.
   In March, the company made it boldest move yet, acquiring
Swedish Match AB, a multinational consumer products group, for $1
billion in the largest cash and securities deal in Swedish history.
Both companies are dominated by investments companies controlled by
the wealthy industrialist Wallenberg family.
   The latest move was one of a series of business consolidations
by the nonaligned Swedes, who are bracing for the elimination of
trade barriers within the European Economic Community in 1992.
   Sweden has remained outside the Common Market to safeguard its
neutral foreign policy, but it is bargaining for ``economic
integration'' that will protect it from discrimination once the EEC
dismantles internal tariffs.
   In the meantime, companies have begun merging or increasing
their holdings in EEC-based industries to keep doors ajar which
otherwise might be slammed shut in 1992.
   For instance, Swedish Match, the world's leading manufacturer of
lighters and wooden matches, recently bought Wilkinson Sword, a
major British producer of matches, shaving products and other
household goods, and the West German flooring group Pegulan. Both
offer Stora access to the Common Market.
   ``We have to create the financial entities with strength enough
to meet the competition. That means consolidation,'' said Stora
president Berggren in an interview.
   He said Stora and Swedish Match sell half their production to
the EEC, or about 20 billion kronor ($3.3 billion), making the
combined company too big to be ignored.
   In similar fashion, Asea AB merged with Switzerland's Brown
Boveri and Co. late last year to become the world's largest heavy
electrical engineering firm. Although both Sweden and Switzerland
are outside the EEC, the newly merged company has enough holdings
in EEC countries to give it a pipeline into the market.
   Ultimately, Berggren said, Sweden will have to join the EEC to
avoid isolation. As for now, ``by establishing ourselves within the
Common Market, we at least limit the disadvantage.''

   The stock market showed a modest gain today in a
bid to extend Tuesday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 22.41 on Tuesday,
rose 6.22 to 2,137.09 by 11 a.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 647 up, 481 down and
552 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 51.53 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said the market continued to benefit from expectations
of a continuing rally by the dollar in foreign exchange.
   A steady to stronger dollar would presumably attract money from
overseas investors to both stocks and bonds traded in the United
States.
   Worries over upward pressure on commodity prices eased,
meanwhile, after Tuesday's rain in much of the Midwest.
   With all that, brokers said many investors were reluctant to
chase after stocks at levels near the high point of the range in
which they have fluctuated since the crash last fall.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up 1 at 128; DuPont, up \ at 90~; Alcoa, up 1 at 53|, and
International Paper, up [ at 47{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

   Senate Republicans today thwarted an initial
attempt by supporters of mandatory advance notice of layoffs and
plant closings to force a showdown with the Reagan administration
before the Democratic National Convention.
   On a 58-39 largely party-line vote, the Senate refused to bring
to a halt six days of debate on the measure, which President Reagan
cited last month as his primary reason for vetoing a massive
overhaul of the nation's trade laws. Sixty votes are necessary to
cut off Senate debate on a bill.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., acknowledged the
setback even before falling two votes short of the number needed to
end debate, telling reporters that Republicans intend to ``drag
this thing on awhile.''
   However, Byrd said he would call lawmakers back into session on
July 6 instead of giving them all next week off to campaign for
re-election in their home states if Democrats do not win final
Senate passage of the bill tonight.
   GOP opponents concede that Congress will pass the legislation,
but they are trying to deny Democrats possible victory on a
congressional override of an expected veto from Reagan before the
Democratic convention opens July 18 in Atlanta.
   The bill would require employers of 150 people or more to give
60 days advance notice to both workers and local community
officials before closing a plant or laying off 50 people or more.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Tuesday he could
not explain all the myriad amendments Republicans have offered to
the bill in six days of debate on the Senate floor.
   ``I don't know precisely what's happening myself; it's not a
requirement around here,'' he said. ``But I know what the game plan
is on the other side and it's to get a bill passed before the
Democratic National Convention.''
   Byrd had planned to adjourn the Senate today, giving the House
an opportunity to act on it Thursday before it recesses. That would
give Reagan just 10 working days to veto the bill, enabling an
override attempt the week before the Democratic convention.
   ``It's hard-ball politics,'' said Dole. ``I'm not sure of its
importance beyond that.''
   With recent polls showing that more than 80 percent of Americans
favor early notices, Democrats and union leaders are more confident
of winning the three Senate votes they lacked last month to
override Reagan's veto then.
   Dole won an amendment Tuesday exempting businesses affected by
the drought that is parching most of the Farm Belt and other
natural disasters from having to provide the early layoff notices.
   ``I don't think we ought to get carried away by the demands from
organized labor,'' he said. ``If we're serious about alleviating
the effects of the drought on the economy, then we ought not to be
hitting businesses with both barrels.''
   The Senate unanimously approved Dole's amendment after farm
state lawmakers said they have been told by bakeries, flour mills
and meatpacking, poultry, egg, ethanol and farm equipment plants
they anticipate future layoffs because of the drought.
   Also approved Tuesday were four amendments offered by
Republicans _ including one to exempt employers from having to give
60-day layoff notices to strikers who have been replaced.
   Rejected was an amendment to extend that exemption to
non-strikers whose jobs might be lost from a plant closing or
layoff resulting from a strike. Also rejected was an amendment
limiting the layoff notices only to workers losing their jobs as a
result of a hostile corporate takeover.
   Fulfilling a promise to the nation's labor leaders, top
Democracts have agreed to delay final congressional action on a
revised trade bill until after first acting on the plant closing
and layoff notices.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, a chief author of the trade
measure, said Tuesday he doesn't anticipate that Senate action on
it until August _ after Congress has had a chance to override
Reagan's expected veto of the plant-closing bill but before the
Republican National Convention.
   Without a separate plant-closing law, AFL-CIO officials have
vowed to withdraw what backers of the trade bill agree is organized
labor's pivotal support for it.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Plummet As Rain Spreads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
dramatically lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade, weakened by
the spread of steady rains over much of the drought-stricken Farm
Belt.
   ``Basically, you're seeing a very sudden shift from very dry
conditions to a cooler, rainier situation,'' said Walter Spilka, an
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   Most contracts for future delivery of corn, oats and soybeans
plunged their daily limits at the opening.
   But the limits on contracts for July delivery of grains and
soybeans were routinely removed today pending the expiration of
those contracts in three weeks.
   Without limits, prices for July delivery went into a free-fall,
despite forecasts for another month of hot, dry weather in the
Midwest.
   The July contracts expire at noon on July 20.
   The Agriculture Department, in its daily weather update, said
cooler temperatures and some additional showers were expected for
the region through Thursday.
   In early trading, wheat was 14 cents to 23\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.50 a bushel; corn was 14\ cents
to 22{ cents lower with July at $3.15 a bushel; oats were 15 cents
to 38 cents lower with July at $3.25 a bushel; soybeans were 45
cents to 74{ cents lower with July at $9.40 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were 1.50 cents lower to .40 cent higher with August
at 65.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to 1.50
cents higher with August at 74.55 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50
cents lower to .43 cent higher with July at 46 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies werer .90 cent to 2 cents lower with July at
36.90 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mixed on Tuesday.

   The Pentagon's top procurement official said
today the criminal investigation into fraud and bribery in weapons
buying arises from ``one word _ greed'' but he said the probe shows
the strength _ not the weaknesses _ of Reagan administration
defense policies.
   ``So, if we have accomplished so much, why have there been so
many cases of procurement fraud?'' Robert B. Costello asked at a
packed hearing of the House Armed Services Committee. ``Is there
more corruption now?''
   ``We don't think so. Due to our improvements we can conduct
viable enforcement to apprehend, prosecute and jail procurement
fraud perpetrators,'' he answered.
   Added the witness:
   ``We are firmly committed to insuring the integrity of the
acquisition process and are continually improving it. Our
acquisition system works. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to
identify persons who attempt to circumvent it. They may elude us
for a while, but in the end, we will prevail.''
   Costell is the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and
oversees the vast Pentagon purchasing system.
   When Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the panel, asked
Costello why ``we're seeing this case now,'' Costello answered,
``in one word _ greed.''
   The hearing was the first formal meeting of a congressional
committee to review the Pentagon acquisition since the ongoing
investigation became public two weeks ago.
   An hour before today's session started, well over 100 people
were lined up along the corridors in hopes of getting into the
hearing room.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee will also hold hearings into
military purchasing starting next month, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the panel, said Tuesday.
   Neither committee's hearings will delve into the current
criminal investigation so as not to interfere with it. Prosecutor
Henry Hudson says has said it may not be before the end of the year
until indictments are returned.
   The probe focuses on allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagon
officials for contracting details.
   Costello declined to discuss specifics of the current case, but
said, ``we cannot and will not tolerate illegal acts that undermine
the department's acquisition process.''
   ``As the investigation's results become available, we will take
all appropriate actions, on a case by case basis,'' Costello said.
``But let's not judge suspects in an ongoing investigation through
innuendo. Let's await the facts and allow the investigators, our
administrative processes, and the courts to do their jobs.''
   He said the Pentagon has taken a number of steps to improve the
way its billions of dollars are spent.
   ``We have substantially improved the acquisition system,'' he
said, outlining a series of steps, including more reviews of
contracts, more use of commercial products rather than products
designed specifically for the military and increased competition.
   ``Although not part of the acquisition system, our enforcement
agencies contribute as much to the acqusition system as the Defense
Acqusition Board or the Defense Logistics Agency,'' he said.
   Aspin noted that the investigation involves about 85 contractors
worth tens of billions of dollars and warned that those contracts
may be compromised.
   ``This uncertainty raises a number of critical legal issues that
_ until resolved _ will cloud the day-to-day operations of the DoD
acquisition system,'' said Aspin.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., noted that Congress has tried
to reform the Pentagon procurement system for years.
   ``Quite frankly,'' he told Costello, ``many of us are
disappointed to see defense procurement problems again in the
headlines. In fact, many in Congres and much of the public at large
are more than disappointed, they are tired of hearing about a
defense acqusition systems that cannot seem to iron out its
systemic problems.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, which will conduct its own hearings next month, said
Tuesay that ``I think we need to look at the procurement process.
We have to re-examine it to find out where it can be improved.''
   ``But we don't want to interfere with the current
investigation,'' he said. ``We've got to get to the systemic part
of the procurement problem and correct that, but we should not use
those problems to excuse pure old fraud, waste and greed.''
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger believes there's no
way to insure against fraud and he said he doesn't feel bad about
the current situation.
   Appearing Sunday on ABC-TV, Weinberger said even his working
every day ``cannot guarantee that there's going to be a total,
complete, 100 percent honesty in the chain of people ... I don't
have any basis whatever for saying I didn't do enough, and I
certainly don't feel culpable.''
   No changes in Pentagon policy have yet been proposed in
Congress, but several plans are likely to be offered.
   For example, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., a frequent critic of
current Pentagon spending practices, has said he may try again to
win approval of a law which he says would restrict the so-called
``revolving door'' between government and private sector employment.

   The stock market lapsed into a broad decline
today after an early advance faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 7 points in
the early going, was down 19.74 at 2,111.13 by 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 5 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 417 up, 1,003 down
and 499 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders still were expecting a continuing rally by
the dollar in foreign exchange. A steady to stronger dollar would
presumably attract money from overseas investors to both stocks and
bonds traded in the United States.
   Worries over upward pressure on commodity prices eased,
meanwhile, after Tuesday's rain in much of the Midwest.
   However, the bond market turned in an uninspired showing today,
leaving interest rates slightly higher on the day.
   Brokers said many investors were reluctant to chase after stocks
at levels near the high point of the range in which they have
fluctuated since the crash last fall.
   Pullman Co. jumped 1} to 7~ in active trading. The company said
top executives were considering a proposal to acquire the company
for $7.50 a share.
   Losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, down 1\ at 52[;
General Electric, down } at 42|; DuPont, down 1] at 89\, and Philip

<HEAD>Investment Firm Withdraws $695 Million Offer for Quaker State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OIL CITY, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ardshiel Inc., a New York investment firm,
said it withdrew its $695 million takeover offer for Quaker State
Corp. in part because the motor oil company ignored the proposal.
   ``We had hoped (to) put leverage on them to talk to us, but they
maintained their policy of silence,'' Dennis McCormick, an Ardshiel
senior managing partner, said Tuesday.
   ``It may not be the end of the game,'' he said. ``We like the
company, and we believe we have some good ideas for it.''
   McCormick said Ardshiel ``looked at all our options, and for a
lot of reasons, we decided just to step back from the situation.''
   Ardshiel said its April 8 offer of $26.50 a share hinged on
approval from the Quaker State board, without which a hostile
suitor would need approval of 95 percent of the outstanding shares
under Quaker State's bylaws.
   McCormick declined to say whether Ardshiel officials have
considered a hostile takeover.
   The investors said they had intended to maintain Quaker State's
core businesses, which are producing engine lubricants and changing
motor oil at a chain of fast-service shops.
   Quaker State, the nation's second-largest motor oil producer,
employs about 6,500 workers, including 450 people at its
headquarters and research center in Oil City.
   Ardshiel is a private firm specializing in leveraged buyouts,
most notably the $1.46 billion acquisition of National Car Rental
System Inc. in 1986 from Household International Inc.

   Share prices closed lower Wednesday on the London
Stock Exchange as the market drifted aimlessly in the absence of
news.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index slipped 1.8
points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 1,855.1, the session's low.
   Volume was a slim 378.0 million shares, down from 386.7 million
shares traded Tuesday.
   Dealers said the market appeared to be consolidating around the
1,850 to 1,860 level. The small range in which the FT-SE 100-index
moved Wednesday reflected the market's indecision about which
direction to take next.
   ``We're in limbo,'' said Jeremy Evans, an equity market
strategist at County NatWest WoodMac.
   Evans said activity in the market likely would be limited until
it sees another half-percentage-point rise in the base lending
rate, following the half-point hike to 9.5 percent on Tuesday.
   ``Once we get that out of the way, we'll be able to move out of
the range,'' he said.
   Several dealers said the market also might remain quiet
following the end of the earnings reporting season.
   ``Without a steady stream of results to motivate things down
here, it's going to be awfully quiet,'' one equity salesman said.
   Another dealer said activity likely would remain subdued until
the next set of U.S. trade figures, slated for release in mid-July.

   The dollar rose Wednesday in Europe as players
became increasingly convinced that the Group of Seven countries,
particularly the United States and Japan, are willing to tolerate a
higher U.S. currency.
   Gold responded by sliding nearly $10 an ounce in heavy selling
in Europe, reaching its lowest levels since early March.
   ``The market has a feeling that G-7 doesn't mind the dollar
going higher,'' said a trader at a British bank, adding that two
central banks, the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank,
engaged in only limited intervention Wednesday.
   Dealers said they saw no buying by other major central banks.
   The Group of Seven major industrialized nations is made up of
the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada.
   Jim O'Neill, an economist at Swiss Bank Investment Bank in
London, said the dollar continued to rise because the U.S. Federal
Reserve and the Bank of Japan did not play a major role in
Tuesday's heavy concerted intervention. Many traders concluded the
Fed and the Japanese central bank have given their consent to a
higher dollar.
   In London, it cost $1.7060 to buy one pound, cheaper than
$1.7200 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8290 West German marks, up from 1.8070; 1.5155
Swiss francs, up from 1.4960; 6.1635 French francs, up from 6.0885;
2.0545 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0210; 1,350.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,337.00; and 1.2173 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2105.
   In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar broke the 133-yen level for
the first time in nearly seven months before falling back to close
at 132.40 yen, up 1.45 yen from Tuesday. In London, it topped 133
yen again and was quoted at 133.70 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar's strength in the face of central bank
intervention was the main factor behind gold's slide. They also
cited softness in other commodities prices.
   ``Whenever the market creates a wave like this, you have
speculators fueling the fire and then there is investor
follow-through on the downside.'' said one bullion dealer in Zurich.
   The slide began in New York on Tuesday, and then was exacerbated
by heavy selling in Europe.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $433.30 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $443.20.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $433.50 compared with $443.20
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $6.26 to close at a bid $440.04
a troy ounce.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market. The metal
traded at a late bid price of $6.66 a troy ounce, compared with
Tuesday's $6.92.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Unions, Helps Workers In Discrimination Cases</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for AM-Scotus-Business Rdp</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organized labor was dealt a potentially severe
financial blow Wednesday from a Supreme Court ruling that non-union
workers may sometimes withhold financial support from unions
representing them in collective bargaining.
   Meanwhile, the justices made it easier for workers to prove
their bosses were guilty of illegal discrimination and barred
states from placing sweeping regulations on professional groups
that solicit contributions for charities.
   By a 5-3 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that non-union employees
of private employers may not be forced to pay the equivalent of
union dues if some of that money is used for activities not
directly related to collective bargaining.
   The high court said that using compulsory fees paid by non-union
employees under so-called ``agency shop'' contracts to pursue a
union's political goals violates federal labor law.
   Thousands of labor contracts require workers who choose not to
join the unions representing them to pay the same amount in fees as
members pay in dues.
   Although federal labor law allows states to pass
``right-to-work'' laws barring such agency-fee requirements, 29
states representing two-thirds of the nation's population have
chosen not to pass such laws.
   In those states, over 90 percent of the collective bargaining
agreements to which a key federal labor law applies carry
agency-fee requirements.
   The justices were told that 6 million workers are covered by
such contracts.
   The high court in 1977 had ruled that public employees _ those
who work for some governmental entity _ have the right to withhold
that portion of their non-member union fees used by the union for
activities not directly related to collective bargaining.
   On Wednesday, the court ruled that employees of private
employers have the same right.
   The ruling could deprive many unions of significant portions of
their revenue. And it likely will require many unions to establish
costly bookkeeping procedures to assure that agency fees paid by
non-members are not used for anything but collective bargaining.
   Wednesday's ruling involved 20 employees of American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. in Maryland who sued the Communications Workers of
America union in 1976. The employees contended that they should
have the right to withhold a portion of their non-member fees to
avoid the involuntary subsidizing of political positions with which
they did not agree.
   They said the union's use of their money for such purposes
violated their constitutional rights and the National Labor
Relations Act of 1935.
   Unions spend millions of dollars each year in lobbying for
legislation and engaging in other political activities. Unions most
often support Democratic candidates.
   A federal judge had ruled that the Communications Workers union
must refund that portion of the agency fees spent for purposes
other than collective bargaining, and the ruling was upheld by the
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled against
non-union employees in a similar dispute involvig the United Auto
Workers.
   The Reagan administration, splitting with some of its
conservative supporters, urged the justices to rule against the
non-union employees.
   In other business-related decisions Wednesday, the Supreme Court:
   _Expanded the way employees can use statistical evidence to
prove bias. Voting 8-0, the justices said that Clara Watson, a
former bank employee in Fort Worth, Texas, improperly was barred
from using statistics in trying to prove she was discriminated
against because she is black.
   The lawsuit against Fort Worth Bank & Trust, now known as MBank
East, was ordered returned to a federal trial court.
   _Ruled states should not be allowed to place sweeping, strict
regulations on professional, for-profit organizations that solicit
contributions for charities. The justices, by a 7-2 vote, said that
a North Carolina law that imposed such regulations violated
free-speech rights.
   Numerous charitable groups such as the National Federation of
the Blind, the American Red Cross and the Easter Seal Society had
urged the court to disallow North Carolina's regulations for
fundraising. They said the restrictions severely threatened
charities' ability to raise money.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices To Rise 4.5 Percent to 5 Percent, Forecast Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices will rise at a faster pace in
the second half of 1988 than they have during the past five years,
according to a forecast by Standard & Poor's Corp.
   Overall, consumer prices should increase by 4.5 percent to 5
percent for the entire year, compared with a 1987 increase of below
4 percent, the forecast said.
   The Labor Department has reported that inflation ran at an
annual rate of 4.4 percent from January through May.
   Since 1983, inflation has risen at an annual rate of between 3
percent and 4 percent.
   David Blitzer, the chief economist at Standard & Poor's, said
the weaker dollar has pushed up prices of imported goods, while
food prices are up because of the Midwestern drought.
   In addition, Blitzer said, ``Rising industrial production and
higher capacity utilization are causing some manufacturing
industries to charge more.''
   The economist said he does not expect prices to soar this year
because the Federal Reserve will move to rein in inflation. But if
current trends continue, prices could rise by 5 percent in 1989, he
said.
   The drought will force food prices to rise at a faster pace than
the general inflation rate as soaring futures prices force the cost
of poultry, bread, pasta and cereals higher, Standard & Poor's
predicted. But competition among producers for other products
should help keep food prices to a 5 percent to 6 percent overall
increase, the forecast said.
   Clothing prices are expected to rise as much as 7 percent
because of higher prices for imported apparel and increased costs
for wool and synthetic material, Standard & Poor's said.
   Prices for domestic cars are expected to remain at current
levels through the end of the year, Standard & Poor's said.
Competition from foreign automakers will help keep increases below
the rate of inflation.
   Homeowners should find their natural gas bills will rise about 2
percent, while the cost of electricity will decline because of
lower corporate tax rates.
   Oil prices are expected to remain at current levels, which
should translate to lower gasoline prices, the forecast said.
   Standard & Poor's also predicted liquor prices would remain
stable unless taxes are increased. But rising wholesale prices and
a possible federal tax increase for cigarettes could drive their
cost up as much as 15 percent.
   The cost of taking a vacation is expected to continue to soar
following a 9 percent increase in air fares during the first
quarter. Hotel room prices are expected to be up between 4 percent
and 5 percent.

   General Motors Corp. announced Wednesday that
some light-duty truck production will be moved from Janesville,
Wis., to Flint, Mich., to make way for production of a new
medium-duty truck in Janesville.
   GM said production of cab chassis and crew cab models will move
in the spring of 1989 from Janesville's Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac
Group plant to the Flint Truck & Bus plant.
   The car line at Janesville is unaffected by the change. In
Flint, the trucks will be assembled on one shift, GM said in a
written statement.
   Approximately 650 Flint assembly employees are expected to be
recalled from layoff when the move takes place. About 300 of those
recalled will be laid off when cab chassis production ends,
probably in December 1989, the company said. Crew cab production is
expected to continue through the 1992 model year.
   In Janesville, employees building the components will be laid
off temporarily during the plant's retooling for medium-duty trucks.

<HEAD>Farmers Takeover Would Hurt Its Anti-Smoking Policies, Lawmakers
Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress began a campaign Wednesday
against a hostile takeover attempt they said would thwart the
pioneering anti-smoking policies of the nation's seventh-largest
insurance company.
   The lawmakers cited testimony by officials of London-based
B.A.T., the world's largest tobacco company, that following a
B.A.T. takeover of the Farmers Group, the insurance company would
have to stop publicizing the U.S. surgeon general's findings that
smoking is hazardous.
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of the Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on transportation, tourism and hazardous materials,
said B.A.T. officials told the Oregon Insurance Commission last
month that ``B.A.T. believes the surgeon general was wrong.''
   Farmers Group says it was one of the first insurance companies
to offer non-smoker discounts for life insurance policies and led
the industry in offering non-smoker discounts for auto and
homeowners' insurance.
   William Braddock, vice president of marketing for the group,
said the company distributes anti-smoking brochures and has
sponsored anti-smoking campaigns with public health groups. He said
the company bans smoking at its home and regional offices, helps
pay for non-smoking clinics for employees and bans tobacco ads in
its monthly magazine.
   ``We urge you to consider whether it is in the public interest
for a massive British tobacco company to take over America's
premier anti-smoking insurance company,'' Braddock said in
testimony submitted to the subcommittee.
   ``It is inconceivable that a parent organization whose existence
depends on tobacco and the avoidance of tobacco liability would
permit a subsidiary insurance company to actively engage in
advocating non-smoking,'' Braddock said.
   B.A.T., a holding company, is mounting the takeover attempt
through its subsidiary, BATUS, the owner of Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp., one of America's largest tobacco companies.
   William Rosenblatt, a lawyer representing BATUS, said BATUS and
B.A.T. officials have consistently told state insurance
commissioners ``that Farmers will be encouraged to continue to
market its non-smoker policies. This makes good business sense.''
   In his own testimony to the subcommittee, Rosenblatt also said
the officials have testified that Farmers generally would be left
to determine how to promote its non-smoker policies.
   ``If, however, a particular brochure ... makes affirmative
statements inconsistent with BATUS' position on smoking and health,
BATUS officials have testified that they would not permit such a
publication to be distributed,'' Rosenblatt added.
   Luken said tobacco conglomerates formed through takeovers and
mergers ``accentuate the insidious power of the cigarette
manufacturers to prevent the development of anti-smoking health
policies.''
   No legislation is pending on the matter, but Luken said he
wanted to raise public and congressional awareness of the issue.
   Luken was joined by Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who said Farmers'
assets could be jeopardized as a result of health lawsuits pending
against B.A.T.'s tobacco subsidiaries.
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, said the takeover also would be
detrimental because B.A.T. is 10 percent owned by foreign
governments.
   BATUS launched its hostile takeover attempt Jan. 13 by offering
$60 a share to holders of Farmers stock. It raised the offer to $63
a share, for a total of $4.5 billion, on March 3. That offer is
still in effect and as of June 17, holders of 28 percent of Farmers
stock had offered to sell their shares.
   BATUS is seeking permission to operate an insurance company from
regulators in nine states where Farmers does business. Arizona has
approved the company's application, while California has rejected
it on the basis of the foreign government ownership _ a decision
BATUS is appealing in court.
   Hearings have been completed in Oregon, Idaho and Illinois and
are in progress in Ohio. Insurance officials in Kansas, Washington
and Texas still must hold hearings.

<HEAD>Pennzoil Considering Buying Tenneco Oil and Gas Division</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pennzoil Co., cash-rich after receiving a $3
billion settlement from Texaco Inc., is eyeing the oil and gas
operations being sold by neighboring Tenneco Inc., a Pennzoil
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Tenneco, headquartered a few blocks from Pennzoil's main office
in downtown Houston, announced in May that it would sell off its
Tenneco Oil Co. division, which includes vast oil and gas
properties and refining and marketing divisions, to reduce its $8.5
billion debt. Analysts said the division could fetch $5 billion to
$7 billion.
   A Pennzoil spokesman said the company has not yet requested any
information in preparation for making a bonafide offer for Tenneco
Oil.
   ``We haven't gotten anywhere near that point yet,'' spokesman
Robert G. Harper said. ``We're looking at a number of investment
situations. Since Tenneco has put its oil operation on the market,
that's one of those we're looking at. We're kind of analyzing the
situation.''
   Harper downplayed a report quoting Pennzoil Chairman Randal
McDonald as saying the company is interested in buying Tenneco Oil
and would use the $3 billion legal settlement from its protracted
legal battle with Texaco.
   McDonald was quoted as saying the company is looking at the
Tenneco assets but has not decided if it will make a bid.
   Tenneco has received a number of quieries on the properties,
company officials said.
   Analysts have speculated that Pennzoil probably doesn't have the
financing to buy all of Tenneco Oil, although it could combine with
one or more partners or make a limited bid for some of the
company's producing properties.
   McDonald said the company is particularly interested in oil and
gas properties but would consider buying everything, including the
refining and marketing division.
   Pennzoil received a $3 billion payment from Texaco as settlement
for a lawsuit in which Texaco was ruled to have interfered with
Pennzoil's plan to buy oil and gas properties held by Getty Oil Co.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Close Dramatically Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed dramatically
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as showers in the
drought-stricken Farm Belt spurred some of the steepest losses in
exchange history.
   Most contracts for future deliveries of corn, oats and soybeans
plunged their daily limits at the opening.
   But the limits on contracts for July delivery of grains and
soybeans were routinely removed Wednesday pending the July 20
expiration of those contracts. Without limits, prices for July
delivery went into a free fall, despite forecasts for another month
of hot, dry weather in the Midwest.
   July soybeans closed 85{ cents a bushel below Tuesday's
settlement price while all other soybean contracts were limited to
losses of 45 cents. July corn plunged 29{ cents a bushel and July
oats dropped 33 cents. Other corn and oat contracts were permitted
to fall only 15 cents.
   ``It was just panic liquidation,'' said Jay Homan, an
independent oat trader.
   Mario Balletto, soybean analyst with Merrill Lynch Captial
Markets Inc. in New York, said the markets had overreacted to the
rain.
   ``You always see some rain somewhere in the middle of a
drought,'' he said. ``But everybody wants it to be bone dry or else
they get nervous.''
   At the close, wheat was 17 cents to 19\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.54 a bushel; corn was 15 cents
to 29{ cents lower with July at $3.08 a bushel; oats were 14 cents
to 33 cents lower with July at $3.30 a bushel; soybeans were 29\
cents to 85{ cents lower with July at $9.29 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   The man accused of making millions on
insider trading in the United States is said to be a rich Taiwanese
socialite divorcee with a doctorate degree, a penchant for buddhism
and a history of stock-dabbling.
   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil
complaint Monday accusing Fred C. Lee of making $19 million by
trading on tips about impending corporate takeovers given by a
junior analyst at the Morgan Stanley and Co. brokerage firm,
Stephen Wang Jr.
   Wall Street and SEC sources in the United States have described
Lee, 38, as a wealthy member of a Taiwanese family who had several
trading and bank accounts, interests in real estate, import-export
operations and public utilities. He has homes in Hong Kong and
McLean, Va., a Washington suburb.
   Taiwan newspapers identified the man as Lee Chuan-hong and said
he was a major investor in the Taiwan stock market several years
ago.
   The mass-circulation China Times reported Wednesday that Lee's
``contacts with high-leval political and financial circles made him
somewhat famous. Lee himself and his story are legendary.''
   The mass-circulation United Daily News said Lee's acquaintances
included Tsiang Yien-si, former secretary general of Taiwan's
ruling Nationalist Party, and former Taipei mayor Yang Ching-tsun.
It did not elaborate on the nature of the relationships.
   An official at the government-run Taiwan Power Co., speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed that Lee Chuan-hong has been a
director of the utility since 1978. A City Bank of Taipei official,
also requesting anonymity, told The Associated Press that Lee had
previously been on the bank's board.
   Lee became general manager of the Taiwan Tea Corp. in 1984 but
quit two years later, telling friends and associates he wanted to
preach Buddhism in the United States, newspapers said. He
reportedly has returned to the United States only on rare occasions
since.
   An account in the Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified
acquaintances of Lee as saying he enjoyed dabbling in the Hong Kong
and Taipei stock markets, where insider trading is believed to be
widespread.
   The acquaintances also were quoted as describing Lee as a ``bon
vivant'' divorced father of two, who held largely honorary
positions on the boards of some prominent Taiwan businesses.
   Lee attended elementary school and college in Taiwan, but went
to post-graduate school in the United States. In June 1983, he
received a doctorate in education policy and management from the
University of Oregon in Eugene, according to Gunvor McWilliams, an
official of the school's registrar office.
   Other elements of Lee's background remain unclear. While he was
apparently well known among business and political circles in
Taiwan, he wasn't prominent in Hong Kong, according to press
accounts there.
   The SEC has been investigating Lee's trading activities for some
time, but it was when the commission's attorneys interviewed him in
Hong Kong last Friday that a break in the investigation came,
according to SEC officials. After denying he knew Wang, Lee
admitted using information supplied by Wang to profit from stocks,
SEC documents show.
   In Hong Kong, U.S. Consulate spokesman Daniel Sreebny said
Wednesday he had no information on Lee. The local branch of Morgan
Stanley also said they knew nothing of the businessman.
   No reports have surfaced indicating Lee has left Hong Kong.
   Michael Perlis, Lee's attorney, said in a telephone interview
from his San Francisco office on Wednesday that Lee was either in
Hong Kong or Taiwan.

   The government said Wednesday its chief
economic forecasting gauge dipped slightly in May, the first
setback since January, but analysts shrugged off the tiny downturn
as no threat to prospects for the rest of the year.
   The Commerce Department reported a 0.1 percent decline last
month in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, primarily
reflecting weakness in the stock market, manufacturing orders and
the labor market. But at the same time, the department revised
upward, from 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent, the gain it had initially
reported for April.
   Economists dismissed the May estimate's small decline, the first
since a 0.2 percent decrease in January, and said it did nothing to
shake their belief that growth would continue at least through the
remainder of 1988 with no danger of recession.
   ``This tiny one-month decline in the leading index will likely
turn out to be an isolated event. The message is that we have an
economy that should be expanding throughout 1988 and into 1989,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   In a second report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said that
new home sales edged down a small 0.3 percent in May to an annual
sales rate of 658,000 units. While it was the first drop in sales
since January, analysts said the decrease was so tiny it indicated
that demand for homes was holding firm despite increases in
mortgage rates.
   Analysts said the June leading index figure, from what is
already known about the performance of the economy during the
month, should show a resumption of the string of gains.
   The current economic expansion is in its 67th month, a record
for peacetime. While many analysts originally feared that the
economy could topple into a recession following the October stock
market collapse, they have jettisoned those forecasts in light of
stronger-than-expected growth in the first three months of the year.
   The Reagan administration last week issued a revised forecast
predicting that the overall economy, as measured by the gross
national product, will climb 3 percent this year, a significant
revision from the administration's original 2.4 percent GNP
forecast made at the beginning of the year.
   This estimate is in line with the expectations of many private
economists who now say that the stock market downturn had no impact
on the real economy.
   ``We are expecting steady growth this year with the strength
coming from exports and capital spending,'' said Richard Peach,
senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   The GNP grew at a robust annual rate of 3.6 percent from January
through March, and Peach said he expected the current April-June
quarter would show similarly strong growth of around 3 percent. He
said this rate was likely to hold for the rest of the year.
   But Lawrence Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, an economic
consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said he was expecting some
slowing of economic activity as the year progresses, in part
because of the fact that farm production will be curtailed by the
severe drought in the Midwest.
   ``We have a mixed economy where some parts are doing well and
others are slowing. That is one reason we have seen the leading
index flatten out in recent months,'' Chimerine said.
   In May, five of nine available indicators registered declines.
The biggest factor holding the index back was a 2.5 percent drop in
the value of the Standard & Poor 500-stock compilation. Without the
drop in stock prices, the index would have registered a 0.1 percent
increase for the month.
   The four other business barometers which registered weakness
were a drop in plant and equipment orders, a rise in initial
unemployment claims, a decline in the average workweek and a fall
in building permits.
   Analysts said the small labor market weakness only represented a
pause following a period of exceptional strength and should not be
cause for alarm.
   Four of the nine indicators made positive contributions to the
index. The biggest positive force was a slowdown in business
deliveries from suppliers. This is seen as a sign of rising demand
and is thus viewed as a good sign for future economic activity.
   Other positive forces were a rise in manufacturers' orders for
consumer goods, a rise in raw materials prices, also viewed as a
positive for the index, and in increase in the money supply.
   The various changes left the index at 192.6 percent of its 1967
base of 100.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. on Wednesday said
it would cut 380 jobs from its energy systems business, which now
employs about 7,000 people, because of stiffening worldwide
competition.
   All but 100 of the jobs to be cut are in the Pittsburgh area,
where 4,000 of the 7,000 energy systems jobs are located. Most of
the cuts will be made by year's end.
   ``Worldwide competition is the major force affecting our
businesses,'' said Richard J. Slember, vice president and general
manager of the segment. ``The business has changed from supplying
large commercial nuclear plants to supplying smaller fossil-fueled
plants, waste-to-energy plants, and engineering and field
services.''
   Slember said a growing number of small competitors with lower
overhead costs are ``making it necessary for us to streamline our
organization to compete successfully and grow in these markets.''

   Led by General Motors, Ford and Boeing, the
nation's top exporters had a banner 1987, as a cheaper dollar
pushed overseas sales up and in turn helped chip away at the trade
deficit, Fortune magazine says.
   Exports by Fortune's ``top 50'' rose 8 percent to nearly $80
billion last year, while total U.S. exports jumped 11 percent to
$253 billion, the largest one-year increase this decade, the
magazine said in its July 18 issue.
   And more encouraging, the trend shows no sign of abating.
Fortune said exports continued to climb this year, reaching $29
billion in March for the highest monthly showing ever.
   Auto parts, electronic components, computers, chemicals and
other industrial goods were the hot products last year, accounting
for $200 billion in exports, or roughly 80 percent of all goods
moving overseas.
   But Fortune noted that even farm equipment, down for three
years, made a dramatic turnaround with exports rising 10 percent to
$29 billion.
   Experts attribute the favorable performance to the weaker
dollar, which has made U.S. goods cheaper for foreign buyers.
   GM headed Fortune's list for the sixth straight year with 1987
exports totaling $8.73 billion. Ford eased out Boeing for the No. 2
slot.
   Boeing slipped after losing more than $1 billion in sales on
overseas sales of 747s. Other aerospace companies had similar
difficulties, including Lockheed, which dropped 14 places because
of fewer deliveries of its C-130 Hercules transport planes and P-3
antisubmarine aircraft, Fortune said.
   General Electric, with 1987 exports of $4.83 billion, held the
No. 4 spot. GE spokesman George Jamison noted that despite the
exports, the company imported about $2.76 billion in raw materials
and parts, putting the company's ``balance of trade'' at about $2
billion.
   Jamison said he anticipates more exports and fewer imports this
year due largely to a changing product mix.
   Current import figures were not immediately available from GM,
but a company spokesman said that in 1986, imports of vehicles and
materials from countries excluding Canada amounted to less than 2
percent of total sales.
   Among new companies to appear on Fortune's annual list were
Cummins Engine, Xerox, Hoechst Celanese and Ethyl, which makes
petroleum and specialty chemicals.

<HEAD>Bank Board Chief: 259 Insolvent Thrifts Will Be Dealt With By 1990</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the agency that regulates
federally insured savings institutions said Wednesday that the
cases of 259 ``grossly insolvent'' thrifts would be resolved by
1990 at a cost of $17.4 billion.
   Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said
in a speech to a U.S. League of Savings Institutions conference
that the ailing savings and loan industry is ``getting better.''
   But, he added, ``The healthy are getting healthier, and the sick
are getting sicker.''
   The caseload of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,
which insures savings deposits of up to $100,000, includes 259
``grossly insolvent institutions,'' he said.
   ``We are clearly on a track that will have us resolving 259
institutions as a minimum by the end of next year,'' Wall said.
   He said he expected it would cost $17.4 billion to shut down or
bail out the sick institutions. About 50 cases have been dealt with
this year, he said.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, has
estimated that some 500 S&Ls are insolvent, more than 200 of them
hopelessly so.
   Last month, the bank board reported that the 3,118 federally
insured savings institutions suffered losses of $3.8 billion in the
first three months of this year, more than half of the record $7.6
billion loss in 1987.
   Because of the S&L troubles, FSLIC ended 1987 with a negative
net worth of $13.7 billion. Congress approved a measure to raise
$10.8 billion for the insurance fund through the sale of bonds.
   That, together with insurance premium payments by S&Ls, is
expected to give the fund $20 million over three years. Wall has
said it is too soon to tell if more will be needed later.

   The stock market retreated today after an early
advance faded.
   Analysts said traders still were expecting a continuing rally by
the dollar in foreign exchange. A steady to stronger dollar would
presumably attract money from overseas investors to both stocks and
bonds traded in the United States.
   Worries over upward pressure on commodity prices eased a bit,
meanwhile, after Tuesday's rain in much of the Midwest.
   However, the bond market turned in an uninspired showing today,
leaving interest rates slightly higher.
   Brokers said many investors were reluctant to chase after stocks
at levels near the high point of the range in which they have
fluctuated since the crash last fall.

   The Environmental Protection Agency on
Wednesday formally unveiled massive new draft regulations aimed at
upgrading protection of 2.5 million farm workers from pesticides.
   The agency said it was unable to estimate how many worker
poisonings would be avoided as a result, because no one knows how
many are occuring now.
   Farmers using hired labor, chemical manufacturers and others
will have to spend an estimated $170 million to comply in the first
year the regulations are effective, and smaller sums after that,
said Louis True, head of program management and support in EPA's
pesticide program.
   The agency believes that a reduction in poisonings by one-half
to 1 percent would make the cost worthwhile, he said, without
giving the basis for the calculation and insisting the agency does
not know how frequent such poisonings are.
   The regulations would extend protection to 300,000 workers in
greenhouses, nurseries and forests who are not covered by existing
rules. They would not apply to non-commercial use in forests, as by
a park agency, or to home use, research, use on rights of way or
where the chemical is injected directly into the plant.
   The agency circulated a draft of the new rules late last year to
interest groups and congressional staffs. In response early this
year, farm groups and labor organizations attacked various
provisions, but the draft released Wednesday made no major changes.
   The regulations will be open for comment for 90 days after
publication next week and should be adopted sometime next year,
True said. The 55 pages of two new regulations would replace a
one-page regulation adopted in 1974.
   Major provisions include a requirement that fields be closed for
24 hours or 48 hours after treatment with the most toxic carbamate
and organophosphate compounds.
   A host of other new provisions would be added, ranging from the
requirement for blood tests of employees of commercial applicators
to the provision of water for washing off spills in the field, and
posting addresses and telephone numbers of the nearest emergency
treatment facilities.
   Other important provisions try to fix responsibility more
precisely for mishaps, generally placing it on the farm owner or
lessee and spelling out when hired applicators or others may be
blamed.
   True said it was ``implicit in the regulation'' that owners or
lessees must make sure that contractors are aware of the new
provisions. ``Perhaps we'll make that explicit after the
comments,'' he said.
   True said the agency believes there are thousands of pesticide
poisoning incidents every year, but doubts estimates of hundreds of
thousands. A contractor once came up with an estimate of 12,000,
which could not be supported, he said.
   The regulations do not apply where EPA already has established
rules for specific chemicals. They are meant to add general
protection while the agency is carrying out its laborious review of
the 650 active ingredients in pesticides, something it expects to
finish only in the next century.
   Mark Maslyn, pesticide specialist for the American Farm Bureau
Federation, said farmers would accept the new requirements in some
instances, but would oppose them in others. ``I don't think there's
any question people are willing to provide protective equipment to
their mixers and loaders,'' he said.
   But as for the rules barring workers from re-entering fields for
certain periods after applications, ``I think there's going to be
an enforcement problem,'' Maslyn said. ``In some particular cases
it's too long'' for farmers under pressure to get a crop to market,
he added.
   Shelly Davis, an attorney with the Migrant Legal Action Program,
said the proposed re-entry intervals are not long enough and should
be based on more than just acute toxicity. She said ``I would
establish a long interval for anything that's an actual or
suspected carcinogen (cause of cancer) in animals _ like a week.''
   Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., complained that the new standards
still aren't stiff enough. ``More stringent standards have been
proven and accepted in California and Texas without harm to the
agricultural economy,'' he wrote the EPA.

   Sales of new homes edged down 0.3 percent in
May, the first decline in four months, the government reported
Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said new single-family homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 658,000 units last month,
following an increase of 1.1 percent in April.
   The decline was the first since a 1.2 percent fall in January,
but analysts said they were relieved that the setback wasn't worse,
especially in light of a report last week that housing starts
plummeted 12.2 percent in May.
   That drop had raised fears that builders were sharply cutting
back on construction plans in light of worse-than-expected sales
activity.
   Analysts said last month's small dip in sales should reassure
builders that the housing industry is not facing a disastrous year,
although activity will be lower than in 1987.
   ``This lessens the concerns raised by the big drop in housing
starts. It tells us that people are still buying homes so there is
reason to believe that builders will pick up the pace in June,''
said Mark Obrinsky, senior economist at the U.S. League of Savings
Instituions.
   For the first five months of the year, home sales have been
running 7.8 percent below the pace of the same period in 1987.
Analysts blamed higher interest rates for much of the slowdown.
   For all of 1988, Obrinsky predicted sales would total 650,000
units, down about 5 percent from the 1987 level.
   ``This forecast is achievable assuming we don't have a sharp
runup in mortgage rates,'' he said.
   Mortgage rates, which dipped into the single-digit range briefly
in February and March, have been rising in recent months and now
stand at 10.4 percent for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages.
   David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of
Home Builders, predicted that rates would hit 11 percent or higher
by the end of the year, pushed upward by tighter credit conditions
imposed by the Federal Reserve in an effort to fight inflationary
pressures.
   Seiders said he believed sales hit their peak in the just-ending
April-June quarter and will be headed lower for the rest of the
year.
   The median price of a new home edged down 0.9 percent to
$110,000 in May compared with April. The median price is the point
where half the homes sold for less and half sold for more. The
average sales price during the month rose 0.2 percent to $135,900.
   The small sales decline was led by a 7.3 percent drop in sales
in the Northeast, where new homes were purchased at an annual rate
of 101,000 units last month.
   Sales fell 0.7 percent in the South to an annual rate of 271,000
units. Sales were up 6.4 percent in the Midwest to a rate of
100,000 units, while sales in the West edged up 0.5 percent to
185,000 units.

<HEAD>High Court Ruling Makes It Easier To Prove Job Discrimination</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court, issuing a key civil rights
ruling on the last day of its 1987-88 term, made it easier
Wednesday for workers to prove their bosses are guilty of illegal
discrimination.
   The court, by an 8-0 vote, said employees can use statistical
evidence to prove that some subjective decisions made by theilate federal
law.
   The decision means Clara Watson, a former bank employee in Fort
Worth, Texas, gets a new day in court in her effort to prove she
was discriminated against because she r
employers viois black.
   Although involving a complicated aspect of federal anti-bias
law, Wednesday's decision carries a significant, direct impact on
numerous lawsuits filed by women and members of racial minorities
who say they have been treated unfairly.
   ``It will have very broad ramifications,'' said Julius L.
Chambers of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. ``That the court approved
of statistical evidence in such cases is a major step.''
   But Chambers and other civil rights lawyers voiced concern over
language used by four justices in discussing how difficult it
should be to prove, with statistics, that subjective decisions are
illegally discriminatory.
   ``It's not clear how lower courts will implement that part of
o a drive-in
teller and in 1980 was promoted to be a commercial teller in the
bank's main lobby.
   Over the course of the next year, however, Ms. Watson applied
unsuccessfully four times for promotions to supervisory positions
in the bank.
   She sued in 1981, charging racial bias. In part, her lawsuit
contended that the bank discriminated against all blacks when it
came to filling supervisory jobs.
   Ms. Watson offered statistics claiming that the same white
supervisors who hired only 3.5 percent of black applicants hired
14.8 percent of white applicants. Her lawsuit said the same
supervisors rated blacks an average of 10 points lower than whites
on annual salary evaluations and also promoted blacks from one
salary level to another slower than they promoted whites.
   Her suit was dismissed by a federal trial judge, and the
dismissal was upheld by the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit court.
   The appeals court rejected Ms. Watson's contention that she had
proved statistically that the bank discriminated against blacks.
   The bank's lawyers argued successfully before the 5th Circuit
court that statistics are irrelevant when evaluating subjective
employment decisions.
   But most other federal appeals courts had ruled that the
disparate impact approach _ allowing the use of statistics _ may be
used in challenging subjective employment decisions.
   The Reagan administration urged the justices to uphold the 5th
Circuit court's ruling, saying employers otherwise might resort to
fixed quotas in their selection practices.
   In the court's main opinion Wednesday, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said allowing the use of statistics in attacking objective
employment policies would be rendered ineffective if statistics
could not be used to challenge subjective management decisions as
well.
   ``We are persuaded that our decisions in (1971) and succeeding
cases could largely be nullified if disparate impact analysis were
applied only to standardized selection practices,'' O'Connor said.
``So long as an employer refrained from making standardized
criteria absolutely determinative, it would remain free to give
such tests almost as much weight as it chose without risking a
disparate impact challenge.''
   That portion of her opinion attracted eight votes. Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the case.
   But O'Connor was speaking for only herself and three other
justices when she said that offering statistical proof that an
employer's subjective management decisions are illegal will be
tougher than attacking objective policies.

<HEAD>Hosking To Retire as Head of CBS Radio, Widmann Named as
Replacement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the CBS Radio division, Robert
L. Hosking, has decided to take CBS's early retirement offer and
will leave the company at the end of July, the company announced
Wednesday.
   Hosking will be suceeded by Nancy C. Widmann, who has been with
CBS Radio for 16 years and will be the first woman to head the
division. Her appointment is effective Aug. 1.
   Hosking, 56, joined CBS as a financial management trainee in
1958. He became vice president and general manager at WCBS-TV in
New York in 1970 and was appointed to the same post at WCAU-TV in
Philadelphia three years later.
   He became vice president of affilate relations for the CBS
Television network in 1978, and two years later joined CBS Radio as
executive vice president. He became president of the radio division
in 1981.
   Hosking is taking early retirement under a special incentive
plan that CBS announced in March. Employees age 55 or over and with
at least 10 years of experience were offered significantly improved
pension benefits provided they notified the company by July 1 of
their intention to accept the proposal.
   CBS said about 800 employees were eligible. A CBS spokeswoman,
Alice Henderson, said she had no information on how many people had
signed up. When a similar early retirement plan was offered in the
fall of 1985, the company said about 32 percent of the eligible
employees signed up.
   Hosking said he is leaving CBS with good feelings for the
company.
   ``It was a matter of did I want to continue to be in
broadcasting for another 10 years or try something else,'' he said
in an interview.
   He said he and his wife ``decided to both leave our jobs, spend
a lot of time together and go teach.'' His wife is a lawyer.
   Ms. Widmann, 44, began with CBS as an account executive for CBS
radio advertising sales in 1972 and was named its New York sales
manager four years later.
   She has been vice president for the CBS-owned radio stations
since 1987.
   The CBS Radio division owns and operates 18 radio stations, two
radio networks with a combined total of 600 affiliates, a
syndicated programming service with an additional 250 affiliates
and a national sales organization.

   Interest-rate worries helped push stock prices
lower Wednesday in an erratic session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 7 points in
early trading and down nearly 20 at its midsession low, finished
with an 8.89 loss at 2,121.98.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
591 up, 892 down and 499 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 159.59 million
shares, against 152.37 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 191.22 million shares.
   Analysts said traders still were expecting a continuing rally by
the dollar in foreign exchange. A steady to stronger dollar would
presumably attract money from overseas investors to both stocks and
bonds traded in the United States.
   Worries over upward pressure on commodity prices eased,
meanwhile, after Tuesday's rain in much of the Midwest.
   However, the bond market turned in an uninspired showing,
leaving interest rates slightly higher on the day.
   Brokers said many investors were reluctant to chase after stocks
at levels near the high point of the range in which they have
fluctuated since the crash last fall.
   Stocks showed little effect either way from the Commerce
Department's report that the index of leading economic indicators
slipped 0.1 percent in May.
   Losers among the blue chips included Exxon, down { at 45}; Ford
Motor, down } at 52|; General Electric, down ] at 43; DuPont, down
{ at 90[, and Philip Morris, down ] at 83|.
   Pullman Co. jumped 1} to 7~ in active trading. The company said
top executives were considering a proposal to acquire the company
for $7.50 a share.
   McGraw-Hill climbed 3| to 61|. The company said it would
reorganize into three operating companies embracing its publishing,
financial services and information services businesses.
   Del Webb Corp. rose 1[ to 15. The company said it knew of no
corporate news to account for the advance, and said it appeared
some party was accumulating its shares.
   Quaker State Corp. fell 2{ to 21]. A group led by a New York
investment banking firm said it was withdrawing its proposal to
acquire Quaker State for $26.50 a share.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $10.86 billion, or 0.40
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .64 to 153.13.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.37 to 313.20, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.33 at 270.98.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dipped .01 to 391.66. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 307.15, down 1.27.

<HEAD>GOP Senators Try To Force Vote on Dukakis' Plant Closing Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republicans on Wednesday tried to make
Democrats vote against a Massachusetts plant closing law touted by
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis as the price for allowing
federally mandated layoff notices.
   Democrats balked, calling the maneuver a ``triviabuster.'' But
the GOP move temporarily delayed further action on a bill to
require 60 days advance notice of plant closings and layoffs
affecting 50 or more workers.
   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., took the bill off the
floor and said he would reconvene the Senate next Wednesday,
cutting short 11 days of uninterrupted campaigning many lawmakers
had planned over an extended July Fourth holiday.
   But there were doubts that enough of the 46 Republicans would
show up then to permit votes on ending what Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., called a ``triviabuster' by the GOP through the use of
several trivial amendments.
   Byrd on Wednesday could muster only 58 _ all 53 voting Democrats
plus five Republicans _ of the 60 votes needed to end six days of
debate and bring the bill to a final vote.
   ``If there is an agreement from the other side that we can pass
the bill today, I'm receptive,'' Byrd said. ``But we're not going
to sit around here and fiddle-faddle with these little amendments
that don't mean anything.''
   Byrd made the remarks after Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of
Kansas said he planned to introduce a substitute bill that mirrored
the 1984 state plant closing notice law that Dukakis won as
Massachusetts governor.
   Dukakis boasted throughout the presidential primaries that
because of his efforts Massachusetts is ``the one state that has a
comprehensive plant closing law.''
   But labor leaders and other critics claim the Massachusetts law
has no teeth because employers are only requested _ not required _
to give advance notice as a condition for obtaining state economnic
development aid.
   ``Let's vote on the Dukakis plan. Let's see how many votes he
has,'' Dole said. ``He's for giving notice in his state, but he
wants to give it voluntarily.''
   Dole said he thinks President Reagan would sign a bill seeking
voluntary rather than mandatory notices and offering incentives
rather than fines as an inducement.
   Vice President George Bush has endorsed a similar measure that
would condition federal contracts and tax incentives to companies
on a pledge to voluntarily provide advance layoff notices as part
of their affirmative action hiring plans.
   Democrats had hoped to win both Senate and House passage of the
bill before recessing for the July Fourth holiday. That would give
Reagan 10 days to exercise his expected veto and Congress enough
time to vote on overriding it before the Democratic National
Convention opens July 18 in Atlanta.
   ``This is a priority for the Democratic convention ... but
somehow those plans have failed,'' Dole quipped. ``I know that it's
big on organized labor's list and they have a lot of clout in this
body.''
   AFL-CIO leaders had threatened to withdraw their pivotal support
for a revised plant closing bill that Reagan vetoed last month
because of the layoff notices if Congress did not first vote on the
plant closing provisions as a separate measure.
   Byrd denied that he is ``dancing to the tune of organized
labor,'' saying he promised AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, United
Auto Workers President Owen Bieber and United Mine Workers
President Richard Trumka only to put another trade bill on Reagan's
desk.
   Byrd acknowledged that a trade bill unincumbered by a plant
closing provision is not likely to win Senate approval without
completing congressional action on the layoff notices first.
   ``After the Democratic convention, maybe after the Republican
convention, we can do the trade bill,'' he said.

   The dollar finished mostly higher against
foreign currencies in U.S. trading Wednesday despite a late selloff
incited by rumors of aggressive central bank intervention, currency
brokers said.
   Gold prices eased further in New York after falling sharply in
Europe. At of 4 p.m. EDT, Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$435.30 a troy ounce, down from $437.20 at the same time Tuesday.
   Money traders have attributed the dollar's persistent rise in
value over the past several days to an increasing perception that
the major industrialized democracies are willing to tolerate a more
expensive U.S. currency.
   But the dollar's growing attractiveness in foreign exchange
markets was dampened somewhat Wednesday after Japan's central bank
governor Satoshi Sumita said Tuesday in Tokyo that he was ready to
stem the rise if necessary.
   Rumors also spread that other central banks sold dollars late
Wednesday, concerned that the U.S. currency quickly was becoming
overvalued. The rumors sent some money traders scurrying to sell
dollars.
   ``Today was kind of a mixed day,'' said Arthur Liming, money
market analyst at LNS Financial Group Inc. in Chicago. ``Most
people kind of took a chance to sit back and look at what's been
transpiring. They're trying to decide whether the central banks are
trying to stem rise of dollar or make sure the rise doesn't get out
of hand.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar broke the 133-yen level for the first time
in nearly seven months before retreating to 132.40 yen, up 1.45 yen
from Tuesday. In London, it was quoted later at 133.70 yen. Later
in New York the dollar closed at 132.93 yen, up from its 132.74-yen
close on Tuesday.
   The British pound fell sharply in London to $1.7060 from $1.7200
late Tuesday but recovered partly in the United States. The pound
fetched $1.7132 in late New York trading, up from $1.7085 late
Tuesday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8225 West German marks, up from
1.8220; 1.5118 Swiss francs, up from 1.5080; 1.2147 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2097; 6.1375 French francs, up from 6.1340; and
1,351.00 Italian lire, down from 1,352.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's rates,
included: 1.8290 West German marks, up from 1.8070; 1.5155 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4960; 6.1635 French francs, up from 6.0885;
2.0545 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0210; 1,350.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,337.00; and 1.2173 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2105.
   Dealers said the dollar's resilient strength was the main reason
for the slide in gold prices.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled down $2.30 a troy ounce to $435.70.
   Earlier in London, gold tumbled nearly $10 an ounce to $433.30,
against $443.20 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold dropped to $433.50 an
ounce $443.20 late Tuesday. In Hong Kong, gold fell $6.26 to close
at $440.04.
   Silver bullion prices fell in tandem with gold. Silver traded at
$6.66 a troy ounce in London, down from $6.92 Tuesday. On New
York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell 13.8 cents
an ounce to $6.622.

   Grace Mirabella, the editor-in-chief of Vogue
magazine for the past 17 years, resigned Wednesday and was replaced
by the editor of HG magazine, Anna Wintour.
   The changes were announced by S.I. Newhouse, chairman of Conde
Nast Publications Inc., which owns both magazines.
   Ms. Wintour, 38, was appointed editor-and-chief of HG _ formerly
House & Garden _ only last September. She previously served for
slightly more than a year as editor-in-chief of British Vogue, and
as creative director of Vogue and as a senior editor at New York
magazine.
   Ms. Wintour was succeeded at HG by Nancy Novogrod, 38, a senior
editor at the magazine who previously worked for The New Yorker and
for Clarkson Potter, a book publisher.
   Ms. Mirabella, 58, joined Vogue in 1951 and was named
editor-in-chief 21 years later when Diana Vreeland retired. Under
Ms. Mirabella's direction, the magazine's circulation rose from
400,000 to 1.2 million, according to Conde Nast.
   A spokesman for Conde Nast, Leslie Palmer, declined to comment
on the reasons for Ms. Mirabella's resignation or her plans for
future employment. Ms. Mirabella did not immediately return a
telephone message left with her office.
   Newhouse praised Ms. Mirabella's ``remarkable contribution to
Vogue and to Conde Nast. Grace's most significant success has been
expressed in the high quality of Vogue's reportage of the fashion,
beauty and cultural trends that evolved during her tenure.''

<HEAD>Grain Futures Plummet As Rain Panics Traders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices tumbled Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as showers in the drought-stricken Midwest
created panic in the trading pits and spurred some of the steepest
declines in the exchange's history.
   On other exchanges, cotton futures plunged; livestock and meat
were broadly mixed; precious metals were lower; energy futures were
mostly lower; and stock-index futures retreated.
   ``It was just panic liquidation'' on the grain markets, said Jay
Homan, an independent oat trader.
   Many traders who had bet on higher prices and worsening crop
yield prospects rushed to sell in reaction to heavy rains in
Wisconsin and Illinois and lighter showers in Indiana, Minnesota,
Iowa, Missouri and South Dakota.
   Most contracts for future deliveries of corn, oats and soybeans
plunged their daily limits at the opening on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   But the price limits on contracts for July delivery of grains
and soybeans were routinely removed Wednesday pending the July 20
expiration of those contracts. Without limits, prices for July
delivery fell freely.
   July soybeans finished 83{ cents a bushel below Tuesday's
settlement price; all other soybean contracts were limited to
losses of 45 cents. July corn plunged 28{ cents a bushel and July
oats dropped 38 cents. Other corn and oat contracts were permitted
to fall only 15 cents.
   Mario Balletto, a soybean analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc. in New York, said the markets overreacted to the rain.
   ``You always see some rain somewhere in the middle of a
drought,'' he said. ``But everybody wants it to be bone dry or else
they get nervous.''
   Despite the rain, no one was declaring an end to the drought.
   The National Weather Service predicted above-normal temperatures
and below-normal rainfall for most of the Midwest in both its
6-to-10-day and 30-day forecasts.
   ``We see the drought continuing,'' Balletto said.
   Wheat settled 11{ cents to 19} cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.53{ a bushel; corn was 15 cents to 28{ cents
lower with July at $3.09 a bushel; oats were 15 cents to 28 cents
lower with July at $3.35 a bushel; soybeans were 27\ cents to 83{
cents lower with July at $9.31 a bushel.
   Cotton futures also plunged their limits in reaction to the
rain. And the New York Cotton Exchange announced expanded limits _
an increase from 2 cents to 3 cents a pound _ after the close.
   Cotton settled 2 cents to 2.72 cents lower with limitless July
at 63.70 cents a pound.
   The crashing grain markets also had a resounding impact at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where livestock and meat traders
scurried to undo their ``drought spreads,'' analysts said.
   The sharp rise in grain prices in recent weeks had stirred
livestock traders to bet on falling cattle and hog prices through
the end of the year, followed by a sharp rise in prices next year.
   But as grain prices turned around and began to fall, livestock
traders bid up the price for summer and fall deliveries and sold
off contracts for 1989 delivery, analysts said.
   Some contracts made limit moves. Livestock futures carry limits
of 1.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies are permitted daily
moves of 2 cents a pound.
   Live cattle werer 1.15 cents lower to .20 cent higher with
August at 64.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to
1.50 cents higher with August at 74.55 cents a pound; hogs were
1.30 cents lower to .23 cent higher with July at 45.80 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .45 cent to 2 cents lower with July
at 37.07 cents a pound.
   Precious metals futures finished lower on the Commodity Exchange
in New York, pressured by lower grain prices and the stronger
dollar, said John Norris, chief precious-metals trader for Citibank.
   Gold was $2.10 to $2.30 lower with August at $438.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 13.8 cents to 17 cents lower with July at $6.622
a troy ounce.
   Most energy futures tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange
despite an American Petroleum Institute report indicating
record-high demand for gasoline.
   Peter Beutel, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York,
attributed the sharp selloff to the United Arab Emirates statement
that it did not feel obliged to stay within OPEC crude-oil
production quotas.
   Near-month gasoline futures advanced due to the API report,
Beutel said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents to 38 cents
lower with August at $15.43 cents a barrel; heating oil was .73
cents to .87 cents lower with July at 41.50 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .75 cent lower to 1.09 cents higher with July

   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile

   Bond prices fell in seesaw trading Wednesday in
spite of a sharp drop in commodity prices and a rise in the dollar
that ordinarily would have boosted the credit market.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue fell } point, or about
$7.50 per $1,000 in face amount, giving back most of the gains
achieved Tuesday. Its yield rose to 8.92 percent from 8.85 percent
late Tuesday.
   Bond traders remained skeptical about the dollar's strength and
nervous about the future of commodity prices in spite of the good
news on both fronts Wednesday, analysts said.
   Grain and soybean futures prices tumbled on the Chicago Board of
Trade as showers in the drought-stricken Midwest created panic in
the trading pits and spurred some of the steepest declines in the
exchange's history.
   The dollar finished mostly higher against foreign currencies in
U.S. trading despite a late selloff incited by rumors of aggressive
central bank intervention.
   ``The bond market just doesn't know what to concentrate on,''
said Jay Goldinger, who heads an investment banking firm, Capital
Insight Inc., in Beverly Hill, Calif.
   One factor depressing the Treasury bond market was a rumor that
the government would issue a 30-year bond at its quarterly
refunding auction in August, said F. Ward McCarthy, chief financial
economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, who said he
disbelieved the rumor.
   Expectations that a new long bond would not be available had
pushed up the price of existing 30-year issues.
   David Resler, chief economist for Nomura Securities Inc., said
some investors are still ``gun-shy'' after a sharp decline in bond
prices earlier this month that was brought about by concerns about
rising interest rates here and abroad.
   ``The bond market was just whipped around. By the end of the
day, it had to feel like Michael Spinks, only it took longer than a
minute and 31 seconds,'' Goldinger said.
   By late Wednesday in the secondary market for Treasury bonds,
prices of short-term government issues were unchanged to 3-32 point
lower, intermediate maturities fell between [ point and ] point and
long-term issues fell from ] point to } point, according to figures
provided by Telerate Inc., a business-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.06 to 110.03. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
Daily Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, stood
at 1,150.01, down 2.01.
   Corporate issues were little changed to slightly higher. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, rose 0.12 to 284.50.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were down 1 basis point to
6.57 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills fell 1 basis point to 6.71 percent and one-year
bills were up 1 basis point at 7.01 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 7} percent, up from 7 9-16 percent late
Tuesday.

   Sterling Engineered Products, a subsidiary
of Trinova Corp., will purchase a West German plastics company,
Trinova's president and chief executive officer said Wednesday.
   Darryl Allen said Sterling's acquisition of Gotthilf Roth GmbH &
Co. KG, based in Frankfurt, is another step in making Sterling a
global supplier of plastic automotive components.
   Trinova did not disclose a purchase price.
   Roth is a leading plastic components supplier to the West German
automotive market. Allen said Roth manufactures parts for BMW and
Volkswagen-Audi as well as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
   ``West Germany is the number three vehicle-producing company in
the world and produces 34 percent of the vehicles in Europe,''
Allen said.
   ``With operations in the United States, a new major automotive
joint venture with Japan and a growing operation in the United
Kingdom...Sterling is well-positioned to serve the major automotive
markets of the world,'' he said.
   Roth manufactures products such as plastic wheel covers, sun
visors, glove boxes, body side moldings and metal window frames. It
operates two plants in West Germany and employs 1,100 people.
   For the year ending Dec. 31, 1987, Roth recorded sales of about
$70 million dollars.
   During the same period, Sterling reported sales of $358 million.
   Trinova, which makes power and motion control systems for the
aerospace, defense, building and construction markets, reported
1987 sales of $1.68 billion.

<HEAD>Court Sides With Posh Ice Cream Maker In Marketing Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that ice cream
maker Haagen-Dazs did not violate antitrust laws by withdrawing
from a distribution arrangement that sold competing brands.
   The state and federal laws may not be used as an ally in the
dispute between Haagen-Dazs and two California companies, U.S.
District Judge Charles A. Legge ruled Tuesday.
   The case, which made headlines nationwide in 1985, involved Two
Count, a Northern California-based ice cream distributor; and
Double Rainbow, a San Francisco ice cream maker. Haagen-Dazs was
sued.
   The decision said the Haagen-Dazs policy, which has national
implications, neither violated antitrust laws nor the contractual
rights of the distributor or manufacturer.
   ``Our company is delighted with this ruling,'' said Mark L.
Stevens at Haagen-Dazs headquarters in Teaneck, N.J. ``Our
distributor policy is healthy for competition ... protecting our
product at every step until it reaches our consumers' hands is
essential ...''
   Judge Legge ruled, ``Haagen-Dazs terminated Two Count because
Haagen-Dazs has a marketing policy of requiring exclusive
distribution, which Two Count violated by agreeing to distribute
ice creams of Double Rainbow, as well as other brands that compete
with Haagen-Dazs.
   ``Competition in the ice cream market is flourishing and
interbrand competition is intense. Antitrust laws are no substitute
for such true competition ... separate distribution has led to
increased and successful interbrand competition.''

<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge delayed decision Wednesday on
the Robert M. Bass Group's request for a preliminary injunction to
block Macmillan Inc.'s planned restructuring.
   Jack B. Jacobs, the Delaware Chancery Court judge who earlier
this month temporarily blocked Macmillan from proceeding with the
restructuring, heard four hours of arguments from both sides. A
Bass spokeswoman said the judge said he would rule as promptly as
possible.
   The Bass group has made an unsolicitied $1.9 billion takeover
bid for the publishing giant.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillan finished unchanged at
$75.12{.
   Separately on Tuesday, Macmillan disclosed that its chairman,
Edward P. Evans, had told Security Pacific National Bank in a
letter that it felt the bank had improperly agreed to provide
financing for both the Macmillan restructuring and the Bass bid.
   Macmillan said Security Pacific had been given confidential
materials about Macmillan in mid-June so it could consider the
possibility of providing financing for Macmillan's restructuring
plan. On June 17, Security Pacific said it would commit $200
million for Macmillan's restructuring.
   But Evans said Macmillan was ``surprised and outraged'' when the
Bass group announced its own financing plans for its tender offer
on June 23 that Security Pacific was listed as committing $500
million in financing for the Bass group's offer.
   In the letter, Evans said Macmillan was offering Security
Pacific ``an opportunity to correct breaches of confidentiality
undertakings and fiduciary duty'' before pursuing a legal remedy.
   In Los Angeles, Richard Warner, an executive vice president for
Security Pacific, said Wednesday he had no comment on Macmillan's
request that the bank withdraw its commitment to the Bass group,
but said ``the charge of breach of confidentiality is absolutely
untrue.''
   ``The two pieces of business that came in came in through two
different offices, and our policy of client confidentiality was
maintained throughout the process,'' Warner said.
   He said Security Pacific's New York office made the financing
commitment to Macmillan while the Chicago office handled the
commitment to the Bass group.
   The Bass group proposed paying $64 a share for Macmillan in May.
   Macmillan responded with a restructuring valued at $64.15 a
share that included splitting the company into separate publishing
and information services companies and paying shareholders a cash
dividend of $52.35.
   The Bass group subsequently said it would offer $73 a share in
cash or, alternatively, a restructuring plan comparable to the
Macmillan package but including a dividend of $58 a share.
   Earlier this week, Macmillan said a special committee of its
board had again considered and rejected the Bass offer.

   Bank of New York Co. threatened Wednesday to
abandon its hostile $1.4 billion bid for Irving Bank Corp. unless
it receives a favorable court ruling within two days or reaches an
amicable settlement with Irving.
   Bank of New York said in a statement that it submitted a written
request to the New York State Supreme Court for a ruling by Friday
on the validity of Irving's anti-takeover ``poison pill'' and
numerous other pending legal issues.
   Irving, in its own letter to State Supreme Court Justice Herman
Cahn, said ``it is not up to BNY to attempt to dictate deadlines
and ultimatums either to this court or the Irving board.''
   The letter noted that top Irving executives will be unavailable
until the middle of next week. ``We would anticipate the scheduling
of a meeting of the Irving board on Tuesday or Wednesday to
consider BNY's revised proposal,'' the letter said.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady denied the bank was
issuing an ultimatum. ``It's just pointing out the realities of the
situation that if we don't get an answer, we're running out of
time.''
   Bank of New York's deadline for conditional merger approval from
the Federal Reserve Board expires on July 9, and Brady said the
bank needs time to prepare a request for an extension. ``We believe
we can't go to the Fed unless we can point to some progress,'' he
said.
   Bank of New York also is seeking to overturn the results of a
proxy battle in which shareholders chose Irving's incumbent board
over Bank of New York's nominees.
   Bank of New York presently is offering 1.575 shares of its stock
and $15 in cash for each outstanding Irving share, or a total of
about $1.1 billion.
   The company said it would reinstate a June 15 offer that would
give Irving sharesholders 1.675 Bank of New York shares, $15 in
cash and $5 in special dividends if the state Supreme Court removes
the takeover obstacles.
   That offer, for all of Irving's 18.5 million shares outstanding,
is valued at about $76 a share, or $1.4 billion, which is about 25
percent higher than the existing hostile $1.1 billion tender offer.
   Bank of New York also would revive the offer if requested to do
so by Irving's board ``as the basis for an amicable resolution of
all outstanding matters.''
   The offer also would be revived if Irving's board favors a
merger with Banca Commerciale SpA, Italy's second largest bank,
which is offering $80 a share for 51 percent of Irving, or about
$760 million. The proposal is part of a complex defensive
restructuring plan approved by Irving's board. The plan includes,
among other things, sale of Irving assets, cost-cutting measures
and a special cash dividend.
   Separately, a Florida bank regulator said Banca Commerciale
might have to seek separate approval from the state to acquire
Irving's Florida subsidiary.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ownership of nine big-city radio stations is
being shuffled in a complex transaction announced Wednesday.
   The deal was designed to accommodate New York investor Robert
F.X. Sillerman's pending purchase of Metropolitan Broadcasting and
involves four companies.
   Among the transaction's larger provisions is the sale of KJOI-FM
in Los Angeles for $75 million.
   The deal was set in motion by Sillerman's agreement in April to
buy Metropolitan Broadcasting for $300 million.
   Metropolitan owns KTWV-FM in Los Angeles, while another company
in which Sillerman owns a major stake, Legacy Broadcasting, also
has a Los Angeles station, KJOI-FM. Federal Communications
Commission regulations against concentration of ownership required
that at least one be sold.
   Under the agreement:
   _Legacy, a privately held Los Angeles company in which Sillerman
holds 49 percent of the voting stock, will acquire 49 percent of
Metropolitan. Legacy, under a consulting agreement, will take over
management of Metropolitan's remaining stations, which are WNEW-AM
and FM in New York, KTWV-FM in Los Angeles and WMMR-FM in
Philadelphia.
   Legacy, in which Carl Hirsch owns 51 percent, will continue to
operate its own stations _ KDWB-AM and FM in Minneapolis-St. Paul,
KILT-AM and FM in Houston, WCXR-FM and WCPT-AM in Washington, D.C.,
and WLLZ-FM in Detroit.
   _Carl C. Brazell Jr., the current president of Metropolitan,
will leave to form his own company, Command Communications, which
will pay Legacy $95 million for KJOI-FM in Los Angeles and sister
station KSYY-FM and KHOW-AM in Denver. Brazell also will buy
Metropolitan's KRLD-AM and the Texas State Networks in Dallas for
$50 million.
   _Westwood One, which is a publicly owned radio company based in
Culver City, Calif., signed a letter of intent to buy 50 percent of
Metropolitan's WNEW-AM in New York for $11 million and to operate
the station. The station, which has experimented unsuccessfully
with daytime talk shows, already uses much Westwood One programming.
   Sillerman, who has extensive investments in communications, said
in a telephone interview that the diverse formats of the stations
would be unchanged, except for WNEW-AM.
   Sillerman said he would have a ``substantial'' interest in
Brazell's Command Communications as a lender and investor, but
wouldn't have a voice in management.

   A group led by Charleston businessman
Charles Way has purchased the Kiawah Island resort for $105
million, in one of the largest real estate transactions in South
Carolina history.
   The 10,000-acre island southwest of Charleston was purchased
Wednesday from the Kiawah Island Co., which is owned by Kuwaiti
business interests.
   Way, who signed a contract for the purchase in March, said at a
news conference that he closed the deal Wednesday.
   Vicki Jinnette of the South Carolina Tax Commission said the
sale was among the largest in state history, but there was no way
to immediately confirm whether it was the single largest.
   Purchasers include Way and members of the Way, Long and Darby
families of Charleston. Other principals include Frank Brumley and
Pat McKinney of Charleston, Henry Holliday III of Atlanta and an
institutional investment group including the investment firm Mabon,
Nugent & Co. and Imperial Corp. of America of San Diego.
   Way said the purchase includes three championship golf courses,
the 150-room Kiawah Island Inn, three swimming pools and two tennis
centers and commercial facilities on the island. It also includes
undeveloped land on a barrier island.
   The sale was financed with a $118.5 million bank loan. The
additional $13.5 million over the purchase price will be used to
make improvements at the island, Way said.
   In addition, he said, the new owners will work to bring in a
commercial hotel to the island.
   Kuwait Investment Co., the parent of Kiawah Island Co., bought
the island in 1974 for $17.4 million from C.C. Royal of Aiken, who
had purchased it in 1952 for lumbering for about $125,000.
   Royal purchased the island from the Vanderhorst family of
Charleston, which had held the island for a century before then.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's top purchasing official, faced
with hostile questions from congressmen Wednesday, backed away from
a proposal he made just last month to give Defense Department
officials the power to prevent searches of contractors' facilities
by fraud investigators.
   Under blistering questioning, Robert B. Costello, undersecretary
of defense for acquisition policy, said he had changed his mind and
would not now write the same memo he had written May 5 outlining
the plan.
   Costello asserted, however, that current Reagan administration
policies work in uncovering misdeeds in military equipment
procurement and that there is less corruption in the process now
than before.
   ``Our acquisition system works,'' he told the packed hearing
room at the first congressional hearing into defense procurement
problems since the disclosure that investigators have issued 275
subpoenas, conducted more than 40 searches and listened in on more
than 4,000 wiretapped conversations in the probe of fraud and
bribery in sales to the Pentagon.
   Among the Congress members clearly frustrated by Costello's
defense of present policies was Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   ``You drive me crazy. ... You're in an absolutely protective
mode,'' she told him at the House Armed Services Committee hearing.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _Henry Hudson, the U.S. attorney who is heading the
investigation, said in court papers filed in Brooklyn, N.Y., that
he has learned of several instances of documents being destroyed by
people under investigation in the probe.
   Neither Hudson nor Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica, who
wrote an attached affidavit, provided details on who destroyed
documents or how they might be related to the investigation.
   _Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., asked the FBI to give Congress its
file on Melvyn Paisley, a former Pentagon procurement official
under investigation in connection with alleged fraud and bribery in
defense purchasing.
   The current chairman and ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va.,
said in a statement Wednesday night that the committee has
researched the records it currently holds on Paisley's nomination.
The only records it has, the senators said, are financial
disclosure forms and associated memoranda and the standard letter
from him required by the committee concerning his financial
situation.
   Although Costello defended his plan for Pentagon decision-making
on searches of contractors' facilities during most of the
questioning, he backed down as the hearing wore on into the
afternoon.
   Rep. J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., told Costello his proposal ``is not
appropriate. ... It doesn't look good; it doesn't smell good.''
   Costello declined to agree the memo was inappropriate, but added
that he wouldn't write it now.
   ``I can change my mind,'' he explained to Rowland. He said that
he and June Gibbs Brown, the Defense Department's inspector
general, ``had a discussion and I listened to her and I said,
`June, you're right.'''
   He noted that Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci rejected the
proposal after Brown complained.
   ``In the worst case, such a policy could be interpreted as
placing constraints on or interfering with the criminal
investigative process,'' Brown wrote in her own memo. ``Such an
approval would be unprecedented within federal law enforcement and
unwise as a matter of law enforcement and procurement policy.''
   Costello's May 5 memo suggested that he and other top Pentagon
officials be given power to veto searches of the private
contractors who supply military equipment. The Associated Press
obtained a copy of the memo Tuesday.
   He said he wrote the memo after a contractor's office in St.
Louis was searched. He explained he didn't object to the search,
but that it should not have been conducted without a prior review
at the upper levels of the Pentagon.
   ``The system at that point had been short-circuited...,''
Costello said. ``If the system had been allowed to function as it
was constructed to function ... the access to the information could
have been achieved without resort to the use of force.''
   Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., told Costello that ``the
memo itself sends the wrong signal'' to defense contractors. ``The
whole tenor of that (the memo) is awfully sympathetic to defense
contractors,'' he said.
   Carlucci, talking to reporters during a visit to the State
Department, said he disagreed with Aspin. ``I don't think this
sends any signal at all that we are letting up on our monitoring
activities or on inspection activities,'' he said.
   In Costello's defense of Reagan administration policies, he said
military procurement changes had reduced fraud and waste in the
government's largest department.
   ``So, if we have accomplished so much, why have there been so
many cases of procurement fraud?'' Costello asked rhetorically.
``Is there more corruption now?''
   ``We don't think so. Due to our improvements we can conduct
viable enforcement to apprehend, prosecute and jail procurement
fraud perpetrators,'' he said.
   At one point, Aspin interrupted to ask, ``How come we're seeing
this now?'' in reference to the widespread investigation.
   ``In one word _ greed,'' Costello replied.
   An another occasion, Rep. John R. Kasich, R-Ohio, said, ``Every
time we suggest legislation, you're opposed.''
   Later, Rep. Andy Ireland, R-Fla., told Costello, ``I simply
don't agree we have all the laws and regulations we need.''
   Another Defense Department witness, General Counsel Kathleen
Buck, agreed with Costello that no new laws may be needed. ``This
is something that's pretty old-fashioned after all. It's bribery,''
she said.
   When Mrs. Schroeder said the current investigation may show
``we've been overcharged'' for some weapons, Costello answered that
``we may have been undercharged'' and explained that the
investigation is still incomplete.
   At that point, Mrs. Schroeder said, ``You drive me crazy.''
   She told Costello, ``I want you to be a pit bull,'' and he
answered by saying, ``I do have a Great Dane.''
   Mrs. Schroeder shot back, ``I don't want you to have a Great
Dane. I want you to be one.''
   When Aspin noted that 85 contracts worth billions of dollars may
be involved in the current investigation, Buck answered that ``we
will revisit every single contract involved here ... on a
case-by-case basis.''
   If contracts are found to be tainted, she and Costello said, the
Pentagon has several options, including rebidding or reletting the
contracts, or barring contractors from bidding on future contracts.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher At Midmorning; Stocks Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged higher early Thursday against
the Japanese yen, although it declined from its opening highs,
while stock prices rose in active trading in Tokyo.
   The dollar opened at 132.90 yen, up from Wednesday's close of
132.40 yen, but retreated to the 132.45-132.55 yen level by
midmorning.
   The dollar fell because market participants were closing their
positions prior to the long Fourth of July holiday weekend in the
United States, said a dealer with a major securities firm, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Financial markets will be closed Monday in the United States.
   ``Those who were buying the currency at the 133-yen level at the
start of trading moved down to 132 yen because of the upcoming
holiday,'' he said.
   The dealer also attributed the dollar's decline to bullish
movement overnight in New York, where the dollar briefly shattered
the 134-yen level.
   ``The market today (Thursday) is taking a break,'' the dealer
said.
   But he added that he expected the dollar to bounce back against
the yen as soon as the U.S. holiday weekend was over, ``so long as
the Bank of Japan does not intervene in the market.''
   Lack of intervention by Japan's central bank since last week has
fueled the dollar's surge on the Tokyo foreign exchange market.
During a regular press conference earlier this week, Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa ruled out the possibility of intervention
and dismissed the current market gyrations as ordinary fluctuations.
   However, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a news
conference Wednesday the nation's central bank was ready to take
``appropriate'' action to brake the dollar's rise, depending on how
the U.S. currency moves in the future.
   The dollar has risen 3.45 yen in the past two trading days in
Tokyo.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, up 209.24 points on Wednesday, rose another 123.03
points to 27,730.36 by the end of the morning trading session.
   The main market barometer's climb was led mainly by heavy
electricals, shipping issues and shipbuilders. Traders said
automakers also managed to move higher during the morning dealings.

<HEAD>JAL To Buy Another 15 Boeing Jumbos For $2 Billion</HEAD>

   Japan Air Lines has decided to purchase an
additional 15 Boeing jumbo jets for a total of $2 billion, a JAL
spokesman said Thursday.
   Spokesman Kazuto Yamamoto said the new B747-400 aircraft, with a
two-person cockpit seating capacity, will be flown on international
routes. The first three aircraft would be delivered from the
Seattle-based U.S. aircraft maker in 1990.
   The decision, reached during a JAL board of directors meeting
Wednesday, was made to win ``fierce competition in the introduction
of the new type of aircraft...and to meet our company's plan to
increase its international flights,'' Yamamoto said.
   With Wednesday's decision, JAL will own 20 B747-400 jumbo jets
by the early 1990s, four more than have been ordered by British
Airways and Air France, Yamamato said.
   JAL placed an order to buy five Boeing aircraft last September,
with the first to be delivered in August next year, he said.
   An official of a JAL union, representing 1,360 crew members,
said labor unions oppose the planned introduction of the two-man
cockpit aircraft for safety reasons.
   The crew members' union and another union representing 1,890
flight attendents went on a 48-hour strike last Tuesday and
Wednesday following disagreement with management over the number of
cockpit crew members in the new aircraft.
   ``We believe the new computer aboard the plane will not replace
the flight engineer,'' said the labor union official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   She said the crew members' union would meet Thursday to decide
what action to take against the management's plan to introduce the
new aircraft.
   During a shareholders meeting Wednesday, JAL's new Chairman
Fumio Watanabe, was officially installed, replacing Susumu Yamaji.
Yamamoto quoted Watanabe as saying at a news conference that he
believed the cockpit crew issue ``will be solved through an
exchange of opinions.''
