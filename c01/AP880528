   A 23-year-old student on a hunger strike
to protest being conscripted was found guilty of insubordination
and sentenced to five years in prison, a military court spokesman
in this northern city said Friday.
   The man, Thanassis Makris, a conscientious objector, had asked
to do social work as an alternative to serving the regular 24
months in the armed forces.
   Maris was sentenced Thursday and appealed, according to the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He was jailed
pending an appeal court hearing. Makris, an economics student at
Athens University, gave up his student's privilege to defer
military service. He appeared weak at the hearing from a hunger
strike he started 19 days before, the spokesman said.
   Military service is compulsory in Greece and there are no
alternative options for conscientious objectors, who are routinely
given harsh jail terms.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government has pledged to
amend a set of tough military laws on non-combatant military
service.
   The pledge was in response to a hunger strike by conscientious
objector Mihalis Marangakis, 31, who fasted for 68 days. Marangakis
called off the hunger strike but is still serving a 26-month prison
term for insubordination.
   The two men are Greece's first conscientious objectors who are
not members of the Jehovah's Witness sect. More than 400 Jehovah's
Witnesses are in jail for refusing military service.

<HEAD>Man Pleads Innocent to Stealing Teen-ager Missing for Four Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VICTORVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 40-year-old man pleaded innocent
Friday to a felony child-stealing charge after a search turned up a
teen-age boy who had been missing for nearly four years, officials
said.
   Patrick Michael McCleery was arrested Wednesday after
Christopher Elias, 17, was discovered in McCleery's trailer in
Apple Valley, a town about 85 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   Elias was 13 when he disappeared in July 1984 from a recreation
area in Lake County, about 100 miles north of San Francisco.
   The teen-ager was reunited with his parents Thursday at the
sheriff's station at Victorville, six miles west of Apple Valley,
and the family headed back to their home at Clear Lake.
   Detective Dale Sharp said McCleery was living in a trailer in
1984 near Clear Lake, where the teen-ager's father manages a
marina. ``One day, McCleery rented a boat from them, and that was
the last they saw of him or their son,'' Sharp said.
   The boy's mother said the only contact the family had with the
boy was one telephone call a year in which he would say, ``I'm
alive,'' and hang up. On Wednesday the mother said she received an
anonymous call from someone who gave her an Apple Valley phone
number to reach her son, Sharp said.
   The number was wrong but detectives canvassed telephone
customers with the same prefix, Sharp said, and the boy was found
in the camping trailer McCleery used as a home.
   McCleery originally was arrested for investigation of
kidnapping, but Deputy District Attorney Gary Fagan said
child-stealing was the ``appropriate'' charge.
   Kidnapping involves an element of force while child-stealing
involves enticement and concealment, he said. A hearing has been
scheduled for May 31 where McCleery may face additional charges.

   Four iron workers fell 30 feet when a scaffold
on the newly reopened Williamsburg Bridge collapsed Friday
afternoon, and one was hospitalized in serious condition,
authorities said.
   The four men suffered leg, neck, back and ankle injuries, said
Peter O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
   James Molin, 23, of Queens, was in serious but stable condition
with multiple fractures, said Bellevue Hospital Center spokesman
Peter Schectman. The others were evaluated in the emergency room,
he said.
   The accident occurred around 4:20 p.m. on the Brooklyn side of
the span, under elevated railroad tracks that lead onto the bridge
that links the borough to Manhattan, said Victor Ross, spokesman
for the Department of Transportation.
   The workers, employed by Gottlieb Ironworks, of Queens, landed
on metal plates 60 to 80 feet above the ground that catch debris
from trains, Ross said.
   The bridge reopened for restricted, one-way traffic Thursday
after a six-week shutdown for structural deterioration.
   Schwartz said two wooden ``needle beams'' that support the
scaffolding planks the workers stand on cracked. Police removed the
scaffolding and were investigating the collapse, Ross said.

   Four men thought to be Kurdish guerrillas
and two police officers were killed in a clash in this township 590
miles east of Ankara, Hurriyet news agency reported Friday.
   The guerrillas responded to calls to surrender with a volley of
fire after they were surrounded in a joint police-military
operation near Kilise hamlet in Dogucak village late Thursday, the
agency said.
   The dispatch said a major and three other security forces
members were wounded.
   Hurriyet said the guerrillas were believed to belong to the
Kurdish Labor Party, which seeks to set up a Marxist state in parts
of eastern and southeastern Turkey.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of
52 million.

   The human sexuality class at San Francisco
State University is in an uproar over cheating, and some students
could be flunked or expelled, university officials say.
   The final examination for the class _ the school's most popular
course _ has been tossed out because some students cheated,
officials said.
   ``I guess they don't want to run home and say they flunked
sex,'' said student discipline officer Robert Westwood.
   At midweek, Westwood said, at least 10 students of a class of
700 were caught taking the final with duplicate copies marked with
the correct answers. The test was halted and declared void. A
makeup test was scheduled later.
   Some students told school officials that copies of the test had
been floating around the campus for about a week before the exam.
One student said the copies were being hawked out of a car.
   Teacher Ann Auleb said she was furious to discover the cheating,
theorizing tht some students apparently found the class too
demanding.
   ``Many students come to this course thinking they know
everything about human sexuality,'' she said. ``They find out they
don't, so they find an easy way out.''

   A Japanese butterfly salesman was caught trying

butterflies, an official report said today.
   Foreigners are not allowed to purchase or catch any Chinese

   The agency said Hiroyuki Wakahara was detained April 19 in
southwest China's Yunnan province, where many rare butterflies are
found. It said he was carrying 816 specimens.
   The report said Wakahara had visited Yunnan three times
previously to catch and buy rare butterflies, and persuaded local
residents to catch specimens for him by giving them presents and
promising to help them study in Japan.
   It said he left the country on April 30.

   Norman Vincent Peale, whose ``The Power of
Positive Thinking'' is the best-selling non-fiction book in
history, reached another milestone with the dedication here of the
Center for Positive Thinking.
   Among the 1,000 people taking part in the ceremony Friday were
television personality Art Linkletter, chairman of the center's
fund-raising committee, and former Kentucky Gov. John Y. Brown and
his wife, Phyllis George, a former Miss America.
   The two-story building houses offices, an auditorium, seminar
rooms, a library and a recording studio. It will serve as a
repository for the documents, sermons, books, articles, photographs
and recordings pertaining to Peale's work.
   Peale, who turns 90 on Tuesday, is a minister and the author of
35 books. ``The Power of Positive Thinking,'' published in 1952,
has sold 15 million copies worldwide.
   Peale and his wife, Ruth Stafford Peale, established the
Foundation for Christian Living 48 years ago. For the past 66
years, Peale has lectured and written about personal motivation.

33-year-old fixture on the Las Vegas Strip.
   Gov. Richard Bryan presented plaques to the three comics, who

billed ``The Living Legends of Comedy.''
   Berle recalled playing the hotel when it opened in 1955. At the
time, it was dubbed a ``nine-story skyscraper'' and was one of only
a handful of hotels on a section of the highway that was becoming
known as ``The Strip.''
   The hotel's newest addition gives it a total of more than 2,500
rooms.
   Hotel owner Meshulam Riklis was on hand for Friday's dedication
along with his wife, singer and actress Pia Zadora.
   Ms. Zadora was honored by Thomas for a concert she gave in Las

   It may not be easy, but Mayor Edward I. Koch
says he plans to follow his doctor's orders and avoid sunbathing
after he had five non-cancerous lesions removed from his face.
   Koch said three of the lesions were caused by exposure to the
sun and the other two were from an inherited condition.
   ``They are common and benign lesions,'' Koch said.
   He said dermatologist Richard Green gave him a local anesthetic
and removed the lesions in about 20 minutes Friday. He said no
further medical treatment was required.
   However, he said, Green advised him to avoid prolonged exposure
to the sun.
   ``I have always believed it is a good idea to follow doctor's

   More than 2,300 fans gave American soprano Kathleen

the New York Metropolitan Opera as Susanna in ``The Marriage of
Figaro.''
   Miss Battle, arguably the best-known female opera singer in
Japan, delighted the audience with a rousing performance Friday
alongside bass John Cheek as Figaro.
   Her reception, however, was cooler than when the Met opened
Wednesday with Placido Domingo in the lead role of ``The Tales of
Hoffman.''
   Domingo earned hearty bravos and eight curtain calls for
Hoffman, which marked the beginning of the Met's first tour outside
North America in 13 years.
   Nevertheless, Friday's audience in the 2,303-seat Tokyo Cultural
Hall called the cast and musical director James Levine back for
five curtain calls. The Met is on a three-week tour of Japan. Miss
Battle alternates appearances in ``Figaro'' with another soprano,
Hong Hei-kyung.
   Miss Battle's popularity in Japan stems partly from her
appearance in television and magazine ads for Nikka Whiskey.

   Public support has plummeted for President
Reagan's handling of developments in Panama, where the
administration is seeking to oust military ruler Manuel Antonio
Noriega, according to poll results published Friday.
   The Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 58 percent of
Americans disapproved of the way Reagan has handled the situation
in Panama, while 26 percent approved and 16 percent were undecided,
the newspaper reported in Saturday editions.
   A similar poll conducted March 21 found 39 percent of the public
critical of the administration and 49 percent supporting its Panama
policies.
   The most recent survey of 1,328 adults was conducted May 20-25,
ending just as Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced that
negotiations aimed at Noriega's ouster had collapsed.
   The poll found that 44 percent of Republicans disapproved of
Reagan's Panama policy, while 40 percent approved. Among Democrats
and independents, six out of 10 disapproved of the way the
president has handled the situation.
   The poll had a margin of error or plus or minus 3 percentage

<HEAD>Senate-Passed Pentagon Budget Gives Military New Drug-Fighting
Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Naval officers would get new power to arrest
suspected drug smugglers at sea under a nearly $300 billion
Pentagon budget bill approved by the Senate.
   The bill, including controversial provisions giving the military
new authority to enter the fight against illegal drugs, passed the
Senate on Friday, ending a parliamentary dispute that had delayed
final action for two weeks.
   The approval sends the measure to a House-Senate conference
committee, which will begin meeting next month to try to work out
differences between the House and Senate versions of the
legislation.
   The Senate's anti-drug provision includes arrest powers for
Naval officers whose warships stop drug boats in international
waters. The House bill, which passed overwhelmingly, is more
far-reaching. It orders President Reagan to have the military
essentially seal the U.S. borders against drug smugglers.
   The Senate approved the bill on a voice vote in an almost-empty
chamber late in the afternoon, shortly before adjourning for a
Memorial Day recess. That procedure was unusual. There is usually a
roll call vote on the budget for the federal government's largest
single agency.
   Approval came after Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., withdrew an
amendment which would have permitted the death penalty to be meted
out to drug pushers who are convicted of killing persons.
   D'Amato's proposal will be considered as a separate piece of
legislation when the Senate returns next month.
   Originally, he had attached his plan as an amendment to the
Pentagon bill because Senate opponents had threatened to filibuster
a free-standing bill. His proposal is popular in the Senate, but
its filibuster rules are designed to protect the right of the
minority.
   The Senate was close to passing the Pentagon bill two weeks ago,
but D'Amato refused to drop his amendment. He finally gave way
Friday after Democratic leaders renewed their argument that lack of
a defense budget bill would harm U.S. national security.
   Both House and Senate bills authorize $299.5 billion in Pentagon
spending. The current defense budget is $291 billion. The $299.5
billion figure was approved by Reagan last December as part of the
agreement between the White House and Congress to reduce federal
budget deficits.
   The bills contain money for a vast array of weapons. Among those
in the Senate measure are another Trident missile-firing submarine,
two more 688-class attack subs, the first of the new
``Seawolf''-class of attack subs, three destroyers, 72 F-18
fighters, 36 F-15s, 180 F-16s and 72 Apache attack helicopters.
   Besides the anti-drug provisions, other differences between the
two bills include:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   STAR WARS _ The Senate measure proposed $4.6 billion for
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, while the House voted $3.5
billion. Reagan had wanted $4.8 billion. The most likely compromise
would be about $4.1 billion, which would be an increase over the
current SDI budget of $3.9 billion.
   ARMS CONTROL _ Both bills ban any SDI tests that would violate
the existing, ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty. But the House measure contains two other
restrictions, including a ban on spending for any weapons that
violate numerical restrictions on various categories of weapons in
the unratified 1979 SALT II treaty, and a ban on all but the
smallest tests of U.S. nuclear weapons.
   PAY RAISE _ The Senate approved Reagan's request for a 4.3
percent average pay raise for the nation's 2.1 million uniformed
military personnel, while the House voted for a 4 percent increase.
   BASE CLOSINGS _ The Senate bill creates a 15-member Pentagon
commission to study the nation's 3,600 military installations and
recommend by Dec. 31 which ones can be closed. No such provision is
part of the House bill, although that chamber is considering the
base-closing commission as part of a separate bill.
   CENTRAL AMERICA _ The House bill includes a prohibition against
sending any U.S. combat troops to leftist-ruled Nicaragua, a ban
the Senate refused to add. Reagan has repeatedly said the United
States has no intention of sending combat troops to the Central
American nation.
   LAND-BASED NUCLEAR MISSILES _ Reagan sought $793 million for a
railroad-based version of the MX nuclear missile and $200 million
for research into the Midgetman missile. The House approved $100
million for the MX and $600 million for Midgetman, while the Senate
voted $700 million for MX and only $50 million for Midgetman.

<HEAD>Abrams Describes New Negotiating Strategy on Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is working on a new strategy
for dealing with Panama that would involve a ``four-sided'' effort
to oust military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, Assistant Secretary
of State Elliott Abrams says.
   Abrams discussed the proposed effort in a telephone interview
Friday as intense diplomatic contacts continued following the
collapse on Wednesday of direct U.S. negotiations with Panama.
   One official, who asked not to be identified, said that some
members of Congress are so eager for a solution in Panama that they
are recommending that the administration authorize Noriega's
assassination.
   Assassination of foreign leaders is forbidden under a 1981
executive order.
   Abrams said the new initiative would involve discussions among
officials from the United States, Latin American democracies, the
Panamanian government and the opposition.
   ``What many Latins have in mind is seeing if they can negotiate
a complete package deal and seeing if they can get Noriega and the
United States to go along,'' Abrams said.
   He said Noriega would more likely accept a negotiated solution
if the Latin American democracies can work together to isolate him
diplomatically.
   Abrams acknowledged the task won't be easy because of the strong
sentiment in the hemisphere in support of non-interventionism.
Weighing against that sentiment, he said, ``is the growing support
in the hemisphere for human rights and democracy and the war on
drugs.''
   Two federal grand juries in Florida indicted Noriega in February
on drug smuggling charges.
   Abrams said he does not believe that any Latin American
initiative can work unless the United States plays a role as well.
   Among the countries most receptive to the idea of a Latin
American initiative in Panama are Guatemala and Venezuela, he said.
   Abrams met Friday morning with former Venezuelan President
Carlos Andres Perez, who is seeking election this year to a new
term and had expressed interest previously in contributing to a
settlement in Panama.
   ``This is a situation we cannot allow to continue adrift,''
Perez said.
   Abrams said Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo has offered to
host talks between Noriega and the Panamanian opposition, with
Guatemalan officials serving as witnesses.
   This proposal has been endorsed by ousted Panamanian President
Eric Arturo Delvalle, whom the United States continues to recognize
as the legitimate authority in Panama.
   While expressing support for a multilateral approach, Abrams
said it is essential that diplomatic and economic pressure on
Noriega be maintained as well.
   Otherwise, the negotiations would amount to nothing more than
``sweet talk,'' he said.
   As part of the U.S. plan to restore democratic rule in Panama
next year, Noriega was to step down this August and go into
temporary exile. In return, the federal drug smuggling indictments
were to be dismissed.
   But Noriega rejected the proposal and the talks were called off.
   In a speech Friday, Noriega blamed Abrams and U.S. Ambassador
Arthur Davis for the breakdown in talks but he didn't elaborate on
the charge. Earlier, he had complained that the United States
presented him with an ultimatum.
   He called for ``foreign forces'' to leave Panama and for the
United States to ``leave Panama in peace. Sirs, for God's sake
leave it in peace.''
   During a photo session in Helsinki on Friday with Finnish
President Mauno Koivisto, President Reagan said he and his advisers
have reached no decision about how to proceed on the Panamanian
problem.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III plans to find
a replacement quickly for a top Justice Department aide who says
his departure has nothing to do with Meese's legal problems.
   Charles Cooper, the assistant attorney general who heads the
office of legal counsel, handed in his resignation Friday,
effective July 8. The department ``fully expects'' to have a
replacement for Cooper by the time he leaves, said department
spokesman Patrick Korten.
   In terms of staffing, the department ``is in better shape than
most agencies around town at this point in an administration,''
said Korten. Many officials are returning to jobs in the private
sector as President Reagan's term comes to an end, he said.
   There has been a complete turnover of personnel in key sections
of the Justice Department since the March 29 protest resignations
of Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and criminal division chief
William Weld.
   Five of Burns' deputies left following his resignation,
virtually emptying the deputy's office, and two of Weld's aides
quit when he did.
   Earlier this month, Meese fired his chief spokesman, Terry
Eastland, and the head of Meese's speechwriting unit resigned as a
result.
   It took Meese until this week to find replacements for the posts
vacated by Burns and Weld. Burns' successor, Utah trial lawyer
Harold Christensen, will fill the slot on an acting basis, pending
Senate confirmation. Weld's replacement, Edwards S.G. Dennis Jr.,
the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, also will serve on an acting
basis.
   Cooper doesn't have a job but wants to work for a private law
firm. He said his decision to leave was not based on the fact that
independent counsel James C. McKay is expected to issue a report in
several weeks raising questions about Meese's ethical conduct.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources,
reported in today's editions that Meese met with Vice President
George Bush earlier this month to discuss the political
ramifications of the attorney general's legal difficulties.
   The newspaper said the sources did not reveal what Bush said
during the discussion, but said the meeting was requested by Meese.
The vice president has said he would not ask Meese to resign while
the McKay probe is in progress, but Bush aides have said publicly
that Meese is a liability to Bush's presidential campaign.
   Cooper said ``I have not formed any judgments'' about Meese on
the matters McKay has been examining: Meese's involvement with
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline
project.
   Cooper praised Meese as being ``almost exclusively responsible''
for advancing a number of issues on the Reagan administration's

   In an interview, Cooper said he has ``an extraordinary
admiration'' for Meese's ``ability to withstand the controversy
that prevails at this time'' in connection with McKay's year-old
criminal investigation of Meese and that ``I ... have every good
wish for him in the future.''
   Meese thanked Cooper in a letter for his ``loyalty, support and

the Senate on Friday.

<TEXT>
   December _ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization agrees to
adopt a two-track response to the Soviet SS-20 missiles being
installed in the western Soviet Union. The first track will be
negotiations aimed at eliminating the missiles, while the second
will be deployment, starting in 1983, of 464 ground-launched cruise
missiles and 108 Pershing 2 missiles.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>1981</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   October _ Preliminary talks begin and the two sides lay out
their positions. The United States seeks a ceiling on the SS-20s,
balanced by equal deployments of the U.S. weapons. The Soviets want
a freeze on new deployments.
   November _ The Reagan administration offers its first proposal,
the ``zero-zero'' option that formed the basis of the eventual
deal. U.S. deployments would be canceled in return for dismantling
of all Soviet medium-range weapons.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>1982</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   February _ The Soviets reject the ``zero-zero'' proposal and
offer their own plan, calling for the cancellation of U.S.
deployments and gradual reduction of NATO and Warsaw Pact missiles
and nuclear-capable aircraft.
   July _ Paul Nitze and Yuli Kvitsinky, negotiators for the United
States and the Soviet Union, respectively, agree secretly to a
``walk in the woods'' deal. It would give both sides 75 launchers
and 150 nuclear-capable aircraft. But both governments reject the
deal.
   December _ Soviet leader Yuri Andropov offers to reduce Soviet
European missiles to the levels of British and French forces if the
United States abandons its medium-range missile deployment.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>1983</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   March _ The United States modifies the ``zero-zero'' proposal to
reduce U.S. deployments to between 50 and 450 warheads if the
Soviets reduce their missiles worldwide to the same level.
   May _ Andropov changes the Soviet proposal, calling for equal
levels of warheads instead of launchers.
   September _ President Reagan changes the U.S. proposal, saying
the United States wouldn't insist on matching the global Soviet
medium-range missile total.
   October _ Andropov says that if the United States indefinitely
defers deployment, the Soviets will cut to about 140 the numbers of
missiles in the European part of the U.S.S.R.
   November _ NATO begins deploying the first Pershing 2s in West
Germany and the Soviets walk out of the talks.

   March _ Treaty talks resume in Geneva, with the United States
pushing the ``zero-zero'' proposals and the Soviets calling for a
freeze on new deployments.
   April _ Mikhail S. Gorbachev, having just taken power in the
Soviet Union, announces a freeze on deployments of SS-20s.
   November _ Gorbachev proposes a freeze on deployments by both
sides, following by later reductions. The United States counters by
proposing equal numbers of 140 launchers and 420 warheads on each
side.
   Nov. 21 _ In the final Reagan-Gorbachev summit communique from
Geneva, both men support the idea of an interim treaty agreement.

   January _ Gorbachev proposes to eliminate all U.S. and Soviet
medium-range nuclear missiles in five to seven years.
   February _ The United States counters with a revised
``zero-zero'' plan, proposed to take effect over three years. Both
sides would cut to 140 launchers in the first year. Launchers would
be cut again in half during the second year and eliminated by 1990.
   May _ The Soviets propose a treaty based on Gorbachev's January
proposal.
   September _ The United States proposes an interim ceiling of 100
warheads in Europe.
   Oct. 12 _ At their second summit in Iceland, Reagan and
Gorbachev agree to eliminate all European-based intermediate-range
weapons.

   February _ Gorbachev says the Soviets are willing to sign a
separate INF agreement that is not part of a larger treaty on
long-range weapons.
   March _ The United States places a draft treaty, including
on-site verification, on the bargaining table.
   April _ Secretary of State George P. Shultz, meeting in Moscow
with Gorbachev, proposes a treaty based on the ``zero-zero'' plan.
   Summer _ Throughout the summer, the Geneva negotiators work out
the details of a treaty based on the ``zero-zero'' plan. In August,
U.S. negotiators table a proposal calling for on-site verification.
Later that month, West Germany announces that 72 Pershing 1-A

the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty ratified by the
Senate, 93-5, Friday.

<BYLINE>WEAPONS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The treaty covers nuclear missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,400
miles, which will be destroyed within a three-year period after the
pact takes effect.
   The United States will scrap 464 ground-launched cruise missiles
scheduled for deployment in Britain, West Germany, Belgium, Italy
and the Netherlands. Of that number, 256 have been deployed. The
United States also will scrap 108 Pershing 2 missiles deployed in
West Germany. An additional 295 missiles, currently being held for
testing or nondeployed, will be eliminated.
   The Soviets will scrap what they say are 650 triple-warhead
SS-20 missiles in Eastern Europe, 112 SS-4 missiles, about 20 SS-23
missiles and 110 to 120 SS-12 missiles. Of the SS-20s, 400 have
been deployed and 250 are stockpiled. Another group of inactive
SS-4 missiles and short-range SS-5 missiles, totaling 850, are also
scheduled for destruction.

   The negotiations began in 1980, a year after the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization agreed to the deployment of the
intermediate-range nuclear missiles, starting in 1983. The
deployment was in response to the SS-20 deployments started a
decade ago by the Soviets.

<TEXT>
   Within three months after the treaty is ratified by both
nations, teams of on-site inspectors will visit every missile site
listed by each nation in a separate ``protocol.'' For six months
after the treaty takes effect, each side could get rid of 100
missiles each by launching them unarmed. The missiles can also be
cut up or buried.
   The treaty also provides for on-site inspections. Each side can
carry out 20 inspections a year for three years to search for
banned weapons, 15 inspections annually for the following five
years and 10 a year for another five years.

Reagan in reaction to the Senate ratification of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty Friday:
   I am very pleased with the action of the United States Senate in
consenting to ratification of the INF treaty. In two days I will
arrive in the Soviet Union to meet with General Secretary Gorbachev
to discuss our four-part agenda. Today's action by the Senate
clearly shows support for our arms reduction objectives.
   I want to express my appreciation for the leadership
demonstrated by Majority Leader Bob Byrd and Republican Leader Bob
Dole in securing the timely approval of this treaty. I have invited
them to join me for the exchange of ratification documents in
Moscow.
   I continue to have concerns about the constitutionality of some
provisions of the resolution of ratification, particularly those
dealing with interpretation, and I will communicate with the Senate
on these matters in due course.

<HEAD>Organist Hits Sour Note With Umpire</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 13th graf, ``This is ...' to UPDATE with organist
returning Friday night.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The organist for the Omaha Royals hit a sour
note with an umpire and was ejected from a baseball game for
playing ``derogatory music.''
   Lambert Bartak, who has played for the American Association
minor league team for 15 years, was thrown out by an umpire for
playing the theme song from ``Mickey Mouse Club'' during the fifth
inning Thursday night.
   ``He was playing music derogatory to the profession of
umpiring,'' umpire Tony Maners said after the game.
   Bartak disagrees.
   ``All I was doing was playing to fill during a break in the
action,'' Bartak said shortly after Terry Wendlendt, Omaha's
assistant general manager, told him he had played his last note of
the evening.
   The incident occurred after Omaha catcher Larry Owen questioned
a call by home plate umpire Angel Hernandez. Out came Omaha Manager
Glenn Ezell to join in the discussion.
   While Owen, Hernandez, Ezell and Maners debated, Bartak played
``M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.''
   It proved less than a hit with Maners, chief of the three-man
umpiring crew.
   ``He had been warned about it during one of our earlier trips
here,'' Maners said.
   Maners motioned toward the lower press box, where the stadium
organ is located, and gave Bartak the heave-ho. However, no one
told Bartak he'd been ejected.
   During a break in the action in the bottom of the fifth, Bartak
began playing.
   Maners stopped play and told Omaha officials the umpires would
leave the field at Rosenblatt Stadium if Bartak hit one more note.
   ``This is a first,'' said Bartak, who was back at the organ
Friday night.
   Not for Maners, who says he ejected another organist when he
umpired in the International League.
   There was one more sour note in the game: the Royals lost to the
Richmond Braves 8-1.

   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, blasting the Reagan administration for alleged
$200,000 payments by the CIA to Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega:
``We've been paying that guy what we pay the president of the
United States. You can't be serious about waging a real war against
drugs when we have an administration that can't say no to Noriega.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, unfazed by his new underdog status as suggested by
recent polls: ``Do I worry about it? I don't worry about it. I like
fighting back. (Dukakis) is the front-runner. He's been decreed
that in poll after poll. And I like fighting back. I remember
Iowa.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, hearkening back to the beginning of his Rainbow
Coalition in his call for people to work together: ``Hispanics in
the barrios, blacks in the ghettos, ranchers on ranches, Indians on
reservations. ... There's a tendency of these people to be
abandoned by law. The real challenge is to begin to pull together
our various backgrounds and find common ground ... to turn to each
other and not on each other.''

   Where killer whales cruise the harbor,
eagles gather by the thousands, and moose graze next to Main
Street, what takes the title of most exotic animal?
   No contest _ it's Elsie the cow.
   The light brown jersey is bringing fame to Sue Edward's
five-acre farm in Haines, a remote town on the northern end of
Alaska's Inside Passage where residents say they haven't seen a cow
in close to 30 years.
   Second-graders take field trips to see the bovine wonder and her
two bull calves, the summer fair features a contest to guess
Elsie's weight _ 50 cents a chance _ and her ``date'' with an
out-of-town bull made the front page of the local newspaper.
   Edwards, who moved to Haines four years ago from an eastern
Oregon cattle ranch, says she was dismayed to find the fishing town
of some 2,000 people lacked any livestock, aside from a few goats.
   So Elsie was imported last year from a Yukon Territory farm a
few hundred miles away.
   ``I like cows. I'm partial to cows,'' Edwards says.
   ``A lot of people drive new cars and live in cathedral-style
houses. They're in debt up to their ears but they're doing what
they want to do. I've got myself a milk cow and I'm in debt up to
my ears and I'm doing what I want to do.''
   It's not easy living in a one-cow town.
   Take hay, for starters. Prime alfalfa hay sells for up to $18 a
bale on the rare occasions it is shipped to Haines. So Elsie and
her offspring _ 15-month-old Pooh-Da-Bear and the newborn Little Ed
_ have to settle for inferior hay trucked south from the Yukon.
   But it costs $4 a bale, at least four times more than it would
in the lower 48 states, Edwards says.
   Then there are the local moose, who took a keen interest in
Elsie around calving time. They didn't hurt the cow or Little Ed,
born May 6, but struck terror into the heart of Sherman the horse.
   ``The horse and the moose have a grudge match,'' Edwards says.
``The moose'll bugle at the horse. The horse'll start running at
the end of his rope.''
   So far, the horse-moose match has cost Edwards one downed fence
and several trips to recapture the fleeing Sherman.
   Despite Elsie's popularity, no one else in town has been
inspired to buy a cow.
   ``There's not a lot of encouragement around. There's definitely
more skepticism,'' Edwards says. She fits in farming while selling
gear at the local cannery with help from her husband, David, a
logger.
   Still, local folks who take Alaska's bald eagles, whales and
other abundant wildlife for granted have come to count on Elsie and
the Edwards' barnyard antics for entertainment.
   It started when Elsie was shipped to Skagway, about an hour
north by state ferry, for a liaison with a bull.
   Stardom struck on the return trip. The cow got rambunctious and
tore open a sack of grain in the back of Edwards' pickup truck,
down on the car deck of the ferry.
   The purser's call for the cow's owner alerted other people to
the rare beast on board, and the ship's cook sent down a special
request for some fresh milk, which he said he had never tasted.
   The empty pail was presented at the dock. Elsie, by that time
looking seasick and none too happy, nonetheless obliged with a few
squirts, Edwards recalls.
   By the time the cow disembarked, a crowd was waiting, people
were cheering, and the editor of the weekly Chilkat Valley News had
a camera at hand. ``That's was the beginning of Elsie's glory,''
Edwards says.

   Herbert H. Schiller, an assistant postmaster
general for technology who helped advance automation and technology
developments in mail delivery, has died.
   Schiller, who was 62, died of cancer on Friday at George
Washington University Hospital.
   A native of Vienna, Austria, Schiller came to the United States
in his youth and worked for the Sperry-Rand Corp. and Harris Corp.
before serving as technical director for International Telephone
and Telegraph Corp. He joined the U.S. Postal Service in 1983.
   Under his direction, the postal service initiated technological
developments in optical scanning and document handling. One of
Schiller's innovations, the automated postal teller, will undergo
customer testing later this year.
   Schiller is also credited with establishing a technological
development advisory board of outside academic and industry
professionals at the postal service, and initiated an annual
advanced technology conference.
   A resident of Fairfax, Va., Schiller was born in Austria and
emigrated to the United States in the 1930s. After serving in the
Army in World War II, Schiller was graduated from Carnegie-Mellon
University and received a masters degree in electrical engineering
from Columbia University.
   He is survived by his wife, Julia, and a daughter, Margaret Ann.

<HEAD>Ousted President Says Noriega Used Talks to Embarrass U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle
said the United States was tricked into negotiating with Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who used the talks to cement his position
as Panama's de facto ruler.
   From hiding, Delvalle also said Friday that Noriega exploited
the negotiations on the general's eventual removal from power to
embarrass the Reagan administration.
   He said Washington erred in not bringing Panama's opposition and
the region's democracies in the talks.
   ``I have always thought that (the talks) were a ploy to delay
matters, to give (Noriega) time to strengthen his inner circle
within the Panamanian Defense Forces and at the end, yes, to
ridicule President Reagan and the United States,'' Delvalle said.
   ``I don't think (Noriega) was sincere, and I told the (Reagan)
administration that what happened would happen. That wasn't very
difficult. I told them about three weeks ago,'' he said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Wednesday announced that
talks had collapsed and blamed the failure on Noriega.
   Noriega on Friday blamed U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis and the
State Department's Elliott Abrams for the breakdown.
   Delvalle spoke with several correspondents Friday at a location
the reporters agreed not to identify. He was ousted by Noriega on
Feb. 26, one day after he tried to fire the general, who heads the
nation's 15,000-strong Defense Forces and is the power behind the
Panamanian presidency.
   The United States continues to recognize Delvalle as Panama's
legitimate president.
   Noriega was indicted in the United States in February on drug
trafficking charges, which he denies.
   ``I am disappointed at the fact that they did not use to their
advantage our knowledge of Noriega,'' Delvalle said, criticizing
the United States for attempting to remove Noriega without help
from other Latin American countries.
   He suggested the United States permit Latin American democracies
to take the lead in mediating the crisis, a move the Reagan
administration is exploring.
   Asked if there were circumstances under which he might renounce
his claim to the presidency, Delvalle responded: ``Why should I?
This is one of the basic factors, respect for the constitution by
the military.
   ``All over Latin American there has been a clear, loud message
that (the military) is below civilian government,'' he said.
   Delvalle warned of a rising threat of street violence if Noriega
remains and the economic crisis, prompted in part by U.S.
sanctions, continues. Millions of dollars in Panamanian assets are
frozen in American banks.
   ``I think we will be facing violence in the near future,''
Delvalle said. ``The people of Panama are getting desperate. We
will see some violent demonstrations here in the next few days or
weeks.''
   In a speech to a women's convention Friday, Noriega said he held
the Reagan administration responsible for his personal safety.
   ``I place responsibility for the life of Manuel Antonio Noriega
with the establishment of the United States. I hold the
establishment responsible for the life of this son of God,''
Noriega said.
   The general did not elaborate on his charges that Davis and
Abrams were responsible for the collapse of the talks.
   But he called for ``foreign forces'' to leave Panama and for the
United States to ``leave Panama in peace. Sirs, for God's sake
leave it in peace.''
   The United States normally maintains about 10,000 troops in
Panama, but sent in an additional 2,000 soldiers since the crisis
over Noriega intensified this year.
   Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Eduardo Ritter, said Friday
that Panama's relations with the United States were ``practically
nonexistent.''
   He said relations were bad ``because the United States maintains
recognition of a government that doesn't exist,'' referring to
Washington's continued endorsement of Delvalle as president.

<HEAD>Gandhi's Grandson Preaches Self-Help To Rejuvenate Civil Rights

   Arun Gandhi says civil rights laws are a
big stick, but one that has failed to beat racism out of the social
fabric of the South.
   Instead, he is using a soft voice like the one his grandfather,
Mohandas K. ``Mahatma'' Gandhi, used three generations ago to help
free India from British rule.
   Gandhi, a 53-year-old freelance journalist, is living in
Mississippi to conduct research for a book and hopefully rejuvenate
what he calls a stalled civil rights movement.
   Gandhi's only weapon is his almost-whisper and a long list of
speaking engagements, during which he promotes the self-help
programs he once employed to aid India's poor. Gandhi says he never
points fingers _ only talks and offers suggestions.
   ``We have enough hatred in this world, and we don't want to add
to it,'' he says.
   So far, the quiet presentations by Gandhi and his wife, Sunanda
Gandhi, have caught the ear of dozens of political, religious and
business leaders. The Gandhis have been crisscrossing the state
since their arrival from Bombay last August.
   ``I think the name opens some doors and gives them some
opportunity for dialogue that may not be open to someone else,''
says state Rep. Leslie King of Greenville, head of the Mississippi
Legislature's Black Caucus.
   Black and white Mississippians now dine together, ride the bus
together, vote together, and go to school and work together. But
they don't socialize together, Gandhi said in an interview.
   ``There is no real acceptance, there is just toleration,'' he
said.
   Gandhi plans to live in Mississippi a year gathering material
for his book, which will compare the treatment of blacks in the
South with the treatment of the ``untouchables'' in India's
Maharashtra state, his home for the past 30 years.
   Although Indian laws have banned the old caste system, which
relegated the untouchables to the bottom of the social strata, he
said discrimination remains _ just as it does for blacks in the
United States.
   ``In both cases we have legally solved the problem, but not
socially,'' Gandhi said. ``If we don't do it at an individual
level, it will never happen. The government can't do it.''
   But Gandhi isn't ignoring the government in his crusade to
improve the lot of Mississippi's blacks.
   Gov. Ray Mabus plans to study Gandhi's proposal for cooperative
industries to be owned by poor Mississippians, Mabus spokesman
Kevin Vandenbroek said.
   ``He felt that they were good ones,'' Vandenbroek said of Mabus'
reaction to Gandhi's suggestions during an hour-long meeting in
January.
   Instead of government welfare and private charity, Gandhi said
Mississippi's poor, who are primarily black, need their own
businesses.
   In 1962, Gandhi and a few friends established a trust that
loaned money to 250 poor Indian farm-worker families to establish
their own agricultural and dairy cooperative.
   Within six years, Gandhi said, the cooperative produced crops
worth $130,000 annually that allowed it to pay the workers more
than double the minimum wage prescribed by Indian law.
   Gandhi believes adaptations of his Indian programs could help
the poor here. And he says Mississippians, particularly religious
leaders, are best able to erase racial inequity.
   There's been more discussion in the religious community about
reaching out to the poor, including blacks, since the Gandhis began
visiting congregations, said chaplain Hal Hutchison of the
University of Mississippi's Episcopal ministry.
   ``I don't think that they could prescribe for Mississippi a
remedy for economic and employment problems,'' Hutchison said.
``But I think some of the things they say can prompt us to
re-evaluate how we're going about things.''

<HEAD>Donations Pour in To Repair Vandalism to Vietnam Memorial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans organizations and radio stations
around the country have raised more than $60,000 to repair
scratches made by vandals on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
   ``People have been exceedingly generous,'' Jan Scruggs, founder
and president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, said Friday.
   Scruggs said he was surprised so many people were interested in
contributing money to repair the memorial, which has become the
most heavily visited monument in Washington since it was dedicated
six years ago.
   Three small scratches, including one resembling a swastika, were
found on the V-shaped granite wall last month. A Vermont granite
expert has been studying ways to remove the scratches from the
polished granite, which contains the Americans killed in the
Southeast Asian war.

   Five old trucks and buses carrying food,

as part of a nationwide ``Veterans Peace Convoy.''
   Driven by U.S. veterans, the trucks that left Washington on
Friday will hook up with about 50 other trucks from around the
country on June 5 in Austin, Texas, to form a caravan of donated
humanitarian aid to Nicaragua.
   ``This is a people-to-people project to feed children, not a

Mass., veteran who launched a project he said will carry 40 tons of
goods to Nicaragua.
   The various legs of the convoy are going through 40 states, with

Missoula, Mont.; Minneapolis; Dayton, Cleveland and Cincinnati,
Ohio; and Portland, Ore.

<HEAD>Economists Boost Growth Predictions, Still See Recession in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economists for the nation's top businesses
expect high interest rates to push the country into recession
sometime next year despite their revised forecasts for stronger
growth in 1988.
   The survey found that a majority of the economists, 57.8
percent, believed the lengthy American economic expansion, now in
its sixth year, will end with a recession in 1989.
   At the same time, the survey by the National Association of
Business Economists released Friday showed a substantial boost in
growth estimates for this year compared with a survey done three
months ago.
   However, the economists expressed concerns the rapid growth in
foreign demand for U.S. goods, coupled with continued high consumer
spending in this country, would contribute to inflationary
pressures and prompt the Federal Reserve to step in with higher
interest rates to cool off the economy.

<HEAD>Nixon Says Post-Convention Summit Would Be `Three-Ring Circus'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Nixon says a proposed fifth
Reagan-Gorbachev summit later this year would be meaningless unless
the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates also attend.
   Nixon said that with only five months remaining before the Nov.
8 presidential election, too little time remains for the Reagan
administration to complete an arms control agreement in the
national interest.
   President Reagan, quoted by the German newspaper Die Welt, held
out the possibility of another summit before he departed Wednesday
for talks with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow.
   But Nixon wrote in a column for this weekend's editions of the
Sunday Times of London, ``Once the two major parties choose their
tickets for the general election, an incumbent's authority _ in
Soviet eyes _ drops to nil,'' he said.
   ``Any summit after the two conventions will be meaningless
unless both the Republican and Democratic nominees agreed to
attend. In the unlikely event that they did, it would be a
ludicrous three-ring circus,'' he wrote.

plastic ice cream cone suspended around the neck. They are labeled
``Ice Cream Doll, Made in Hong Kong.''
   No injuries have been reported involving the toys, but both

   Rebel leaders agreed Friday to discuss
a truce extension proposed by the leftist government and one of the
best-known rebel commanders turned himself in to accept government
amnesty.
   Manuel Espinoza, the presidential spokesman, said ``some
advances had been made'' during the second day of the peace talks.
   The government proposed extending the talks beyond their
scheduled end on Saturday, but Contra leaders rejected the
suggestion, saying an agreement could be reached if the government
truly desires one.
   Alfredo Cesar, head of the rebel delegation, said ``we cannot
stay here longer,'' adding that ``if there is political will on the
part of the Sandinistas an agreement can be signed'' on Saturday.
   Felix Garcia Hernandez, known as Alfa Lima, told reporters
Friday that before he asked for amnesty he commanded more than 400
Contras in the Chontales region.
   He said he met with representatives of the Nicaraguan army
several times during the truce and decided to return because of his
family and because he felt Nicaraguans should stop killing each
other. He turned himself in Wednesday and the Sandinista government
announced it Thursday night.
   Alfa Lima abandoned the rebel force with six of his men and said
Friday he hoped to encourage more of his former comrades to take
advantage of the amnesty.
   ``I am going to try to convince my men to come in. There are
many out there who do not know what they are doing or why they are
fighting,'' said the soft-spoken Alfa Lima, still wearing his
camouflage uniform.
   Alfa Lima's former commander-in-chief, Enrique Bermudez, was in
Managua for the peace talks and said upon hearing of his decision,
``We regret it. He was a field commander with a long record. We
consider him a war casualty.''
   Although they agreed to discuss extending the cease-fire, which
is scheduled to end May 30, the rebels still insist on an agreement
that includes a firm schedule of democratic reforms.
   According to a source at the negotiating table, Defense Minister
Gen. Humberto Ortega, head of the government delegation, told the
session ``it would be difficult to reach an agreement by Saturday
noon, but we are not discarding the possibility of a miracle, like
the miracle at Sapoa.''
   Sapoa, a town on the Costa Rican border, was where the March 23
peace agreement was signed by the Sandinista government and the
U.S.-supported rebels.
   Cesar said there was a ``25 percent chance of an agreement.''
   Rebel spokesman Bosco Matamoros said after Friday's session that
``some political topics had been discussed,'' but added the two
sides still differed on fundamental political issues.
   ``We have different concepts of democracy, different concepts of
human rights, the role of the state in a society and the structure
of a judiciary system,'' he said.
   President Daniel Ortega's government feels a permanent
cease-fire is a necessary first step toward peace. The Contras want
political reforms that would enlarge the opposition's role in a
more pluralistic and democratic society.
   On Thursday, the rebel delegates declared they had come to
Managua only to discuss their own plan, which sets deadlines for
government introduction of reforms. The Sandinistas called the
Contra proposals ``unrealistic,'' but agreed to put them on the
table.
   Government negotiators then offered a plan for electoral reforms
and a cease-fire as a continuation of general agreements reached at
Sapoa for a truce, amnesty, a government dialogue with the
political opposition and eventual integration into the political
life of the rebels and their leaders.
   ``The important thing is not to disappoint the expectations of
the people of Nicaragua,'' said Bayardo Arce, vice coordinator of
the political committee of the Sandinista National Liberation
Front, known by its Spanish initials FSLN.
   Luis Rivas Leiva, adviser to the Contra delegation, said: ``We
are paying a high price in the negotiations. The FSLN does not want
to pay any. They are being very inflexible.''
   At the heart of the disagreement are the definition of
democratization and how to go about it.
   Within five days of an agreement, the Contras demand an end to
the military draft, freedom to supply their forces in the field and
total press freedom, including establishment of private radio and
television stations.
   Within two months, they want measures to guarantee political
pluralism, separation of state powers, curtailment of the powers of
the FSLN, guarantees of the right to strike and reforms in the
judiciary and the electoral system.
   The government has offered to discuss electoral reforms, and
announed an amnesty program and a plan for municipal elections.
   ``They have been doing some things, but those are more form than
substance,'' Rivas Leiva said. ``There are some important matters
that involve guarantees for the return of all our people to the
political life of Nicaragua.
   ``They want a permanent cease-fire. We want at the same time a
political process that would democratize Nicaragua,'' he said.
   Cesar is a former Sandinista financial expert. Bermudez, the
Contras' military commander, was once a colonel in the army of the
late President Anastasio Somoza, whom the Sandinistas overthrew in
July 1979.

<HEAD>Dukakis Hits Administration on Panama; Bush Embraces Underdog
Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis is blasting the Reagan administration
for failing to `say no' to Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
Republican George Bush, after sniffing the Maine air,
declared,``I'm the underdog and I like it.''
   Dukakis, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination, ridiculed the administration over reports
emerging in congressional hearings that the CIA allegedly made
$200,000 payments to the military leader, who has been indicted in
U.S. courts on drug charges.
   Campaigning Friday in Albuquerque, N.M., Dukakis called on
President Reagan, Bush or ``someone in this administration'' to
provide an explanation of the CIA's alleged link to the Panamanian.
   ``We've been paying the guy what we pay the president of the
United States,'' Dukakis said. ``You can't be serious about waging
a real war against drugs when you have an administration that can't
say no to Noriega.''
   Bush, who is spending the week of the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting
at his vacation retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine, urged new
negotiations to persuade Noriega to leave Panama, even though he
earlier opposed those talks.
   He denounced as ``an outrageous lie'' what he said was a
reported suggestion that the administration held the talks to help
his campaign.
   ``I don't like it being injected by Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson either. If they have some proof, or they have something
other than insinuation, let them speak out,'' he said at a news
conference Friday on the lawn of his family home.
   Bush, who is meeting over the next week with advisers and
prominent Republicans in an effort to renew his campaign, said he
wasn't worried about polls showing him running behind Dukakis.
   ``I'm the underdog and I like it,'' he said. ``It is May and the
election is in November. Do I worry about it? I don't worry about
it. I like fighting back. ... I remember Iowa.''
   He was referring to his loss to Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., in the
Republican primary in Iowa, which Bush followed with a victory in
New Hampshire.
   The latest ABC News-Washington Post poll said Dukakis was
leading Bush by a 53-40 percent margin among registered voters.
   With the Atlantic surf pounding in the background, Bush told
reporters, ``It's the Maine air. When I get up here I feel _ it's
not feistiness _ but I feel very relaxed. I don't feel troubled by
somebody pointing out that I'm behind in the polls.''
   Meanwhile, an aide to Bush declined to comment on a report in
today's editions of The Washington Post that Bush met privately
with Attorney General Edwin Meese III earlier this month to discuss
political ramifications of the attorney general's ongoing legal
problems.
   Citing unidentified sources, the newspaper said it could not be
learned what Bush told Meese. Two Bush aides earlier this month
called Meese a campaign liability, but the vice president denied he
had authorized the statements.
   Bush has wrapped up the Republican nomination, while Dukakis is
looking toward primaries in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and
Montana to clinch a victory over his remaining Democratic rival,
Jesse Jackson.
   Dukakis needs 2,081 delegates to win on the first ballot at the
Democratic convention. He has 1,711 so far according to a tally by
The Associated Press, while Jackson has 984 delegates. There are
466 at stake on June 7.
   Dukakis left New Mexico Friday, stopping in Austin, Texas, for a
barbecue with state Democratic leaders. He plans to campaign in New
Jersey over the Memorial Day weekend, as does Jackson.
   The two men met briefly Friday at the Albuquerque airport. They
emerged smiling from a private session of about five minutes. Aides
would not discuss what they said.
   Earlier, Jackson told Indian leaders at the All Indian Pueblo
Council that they have been ignored by the federal government.
   ``Hispanics in the barrios, blacks in the ghettos, ranchers on
ranches, Indians on reservations ... there's a tendency of these
people to be abandoned by law. The real challenge is to begin to
pull together our various backgrounds and find common ground ... to
turn to each other and not on each other,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gorilla Goes Ape Over Females' Interest In Willie B.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Willie B. stepped out of his cage and into a love
triangle, gorilla style.
   The Atlanta zoo's famous lowland gorilla was allowed outdoors
with other apes for the first time Friday. As he ventured into his
new tropical rain forest habitat, he tried to get his first good
look at three female gorillas who will share the artificial
environment with him, though separated by a moat.
   Things were smooth until Rann, the 25-year-old male silverback
who lives with the females and fathered five of their six
offspring, realized his harem was eyeing Willie with more than mild
curiosity.
   Life in the rain forest got hot.
   Willie B. ended 27 years of life in a cage two weeks ago with
tentative steps into his new outdoor home. But when he made his
first full-fledged foray Friday, Rann wasn't about to let the naive
gorilla near his mates.
   ``He just knows there is another male ... on the scene and he's
trying to protect his females,'' said Frederick King, director of
Emory University's Yerkes Primate Research Center, which loaned
Rann and his family to the zoo.
   ``Rann is confused. There's another male gorilla, and the
females are interested in him,'' King said. ``Rann wants to keep
'em to himself. He's seen him and smelled him, but he doesn't know
that Willie can't get to the ladies.''
   Rann spent most of the day watching for Willie B. to appear
across the moat. He plopped onto the ground and munched tomatoes
tossed out by trainers as a lure.
   When Willie B. drifted into his line of vision and perched under
a magnolia tree, Rann hopped up and chased the female gorillas
inside. Willie B. responded by slamming his cage door as he drifted
in and out.
   The ritual got violent when Shamba, the dominant female in
Rann's harem, trotted out in mild flirtation to get a look at
Willie B. Her advances prompted a jealous Rann to shove her back
inside and, later, to smack her on the head.
   Rann wouldn't even allow the females to wander out and gather
the fruit and other goodies that trainers offered, preferring to
gobble the foodstuffs himself while he preened for photographers.
   King said Rann's jealousy may keep him from becoming friends
with Willie B., who is named for the late Atlanta Mayor William B.
Hartsfield.
   Willie B.'s shift to outdoor life after more than two decades as
a loner would have been eased by placing him with a female who
could have ``shown him the things he would need to know'' about
socializing, he said.
   Two other ape families from Yerkes will join the gorillas in the
rain forest, which opens to the public June 11, King said. None of
the Yerkes animals will be housed with Willie, but zoo officials
say they are considering whether to bring in a female roommate for
him.
   The outdoor habitat is a major step forward for Zoo Atlanta,
which the Humane Society declared one of the nation's worst zoos
four years ago. Zoo Atlanta officials say the new exhibit, built
with a $1 million grant from Ford Motor Co., is the most advanced
gorilla habitat at any zoo.

<TEXT>
   Latin America _ with a new
tradition of democracy and an old wariness of the United States _
is in a tricky position when it comes to Panama and its military
boss Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   On one hand, the democracies of South and Central American have
expressed little support for Noriega. They consider him a throwback
to an earlier era when military men called the shots in
thinly-disguised dictatorships.
   On the other hand, these nations frown on overt attempts by the
United States to dictate who should run a country and how he should
do it.
   Their experience with Washington's alleged high-handedness goes
back decades and is not easily forgotten.
   It is little wonder therefore that their reaction to the
breakdown of U.S.-Panamanian talks aimed at Noriega's removal has
been cautious and wavering.
   The talks involved an offer from the United States to drop
drug-trafficking charges against Noriega in exchange for his
removal as Panama's leader.
   Washington's two rivals in the region, Cuba and Nicaragua, have
expressed strong support for Noriega in his confrontation with the
United States. They have presented the conflict as a classic
example of a small but proud country valiantly standing up to
Yankee imperialism.
   Most Latin American democracies criticize Noriega but stress
that Panama's people, and not Washington, should decide who should
lead that strategic country.
   On Thursday, Colombian Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes
summed up their feelings best.
   The Panamanian ``problem must be resolved by Panamanians
themselves,'' he said, ``without foreign interference and with the
objective of re-establishing democracy in Panama.''
   And Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo may have offered both
the United States and Panama a way out.
   Cerezo said he is willing to mediate a plan ``aimed at finding a
space for dialogue in Panama in order to consolidate a
democratizing process.''
   Cerezo said early this month that Panama had reacted favorably
to his offer and that he would pursue the idea with representatives
of the Panamanian opposition and with other Central American
leaders.
   ``We believe Panama is drifting toward confrontation and
violence, toward radicalization against the United States, which is
dangerous for the region and is also causing great damage to
Panama,'' he told journalists Thursday night.
   In Venezuela, a Foreign Ministry official was quoted Friday in
Caracas' El Universal as echoing Cerezo's perspective.
   Venezuela, he said, would ``seek democracy (in Panama) but
without the open intervention of other governments trying to
dictate to Panama how it should act.''
   Oscar Arias, president of Costa Rica and winner of last year's
Nobel Peace Prize, has come out against the Reagan administration's
economic sanctions against Panama. Arias, the main author of a
Central American peace plan signed last August, contends the
sanctions have unjustly hurt the average Panamanian.
   He was involved in late March in a Panamanian mediation attempt
that also included Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   The proposal included a major role for the Panamanian Roman
Catholic Church, but the initiative did not prosper.
   Mexico has continued to provide Panama with oil under the San
Jose Pact, which serves small nations of the Caribbean and Central
America.
   An editorial in Mexico City's daily El Universal said
circumstances warranted ``a respectful participation of others on
the continent on behalf of the real and transcendent interests of a
small country that is suffering the effects of a `strongman-ism'
fostered by the White House.''

<TEXT>
   Detroit remains a man's world, with women making
up less than 2 percent of top executives in the auto industry,
according to the 1988 Who's Who guide to car companies.
   But in the ranks beneath the graying corporate upper crust, more
and more women are following paths that will lead them to the
industry's executive suites and boardrooms, analysts say.
   Of the 966 top executives in the auto industry and supplier
companies listed in a directory published this week, 16 were women.
   The annual Who's Who in the Automobile Industry, included in the
Market Data Book published by the trade journal Automotive News,
includes top executives and some lower-level, primarily marketing
executives.
   This year's version, current as of April, shows General Motors
Corp. with nine female executives, Ford Motor Co. with two and
Chrysler Corp. with none. The five other women on the list worked
for companies related to the auto industry.
   ``Most of the people in that list are relatively senior,'' said
David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the
Study of Automotive Transportation in Ann Arbor.
   ``In the next five years I would expect to see a significant
acceleration in female involvement ... as more women work their way
up through the product or manufacturing function and arrive at the
executive level,'' Cole said Friday.
   In 1987, the list contained 986 names, including 12 women or
about 1.2 percent. Women made up 1.7 percent of the listed
executives in 1988.
   ``That's actually a great stride for us. It's been a long time
for us; it's certainly been a man's domain for many years,'' said
Jeanne Beyer, vice president for market research and planning at
Global Motors Inc. and one of the women on the 1988 list.
   Cole and Beyer say women are not yet well represented in the
upper ranks because it was only recently that they began choosing
careers that would involve them in the auto industry.
   ``It's only in the last 10 or 15 years that we are starting to
see significant female involvement in our (engineering) program.
Today it is 25 percent,'' Cole said.
   Women now working their way up as engineers, designers, plant
managers or financial experts are part of the corporate mainstream
that produces top executives from inside the companies, Cole said.
   By contrast, most of the women already in the top ranks at GM
and Ford came from the outside, Cole said.
   Once women are on a career track, it takes 15-20 years to reach
the main executive ranks from which top corporate officers are
selected, Cole said.
   ``Now that women have pursued those careers, the recognition and
opportunity is coming. But it's no faster for women than it is for
men,'' Beyer agreed.
   In 1987, women accounted for 18.9 percent of GM's total work
force of 451,571 and 10.8 percent of all corporate officials and
managers. At Ford, women made up 15.2 percent of the 180,000-member
work force and 5 percent of the managerial and executive ranks.
   Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart said Chrysler's 1987 Equal
Employment Opportunity figures had not been compiled, but she
offered 1986 figures: women comprised 13.6 percent of the
87,987-worker total and 4.2 percent of the managers and executives.
   Once enough women are far enough along in the corporate
pipeline, Cole said he expects they will begin to be
overrepresented in top executive positions.
   ``They have tremendous ambition but also great interpersonal
skills,'' he said. ``It is necessary to have real ability to work
with people in a very team-type setting'' that is becoming the norm
in the auto industry.

   More than 40 years ago, a Ukrainian
farmer risked his life to hide a Jewish family from Nazi soldiers.
Now that family, who lives in New Jersey, plans to thank him in
person.
   Five members of the Zeiger family, originally of the Ukraine,
left Friday for the Soviet Union to visit Antosh Suchinsky, who
still lives on the farm where the family hid beneath a barn for two
years.
   The trip comes during the superpower summit in Moscow, but the
reunion is purely a private affair, said Michael Zeiger, who was 8
years old when he went into hiding.
   ``This is only for us, but there is a bigger message,'' he said.
``If you don't watch out, what happened then could happen now. I
will never forget it and I hope nobody else does.''
   For two terrifying years, Zeiger, his mother, father, brother
and two children whose parents were captured by the Nazis lived in
a 4-foot-deep hole under Suchinsky's barn, afraid to even light a
candle. Zeiger's father told stories to keep the children occupied.
The quarters were so cramped the adults could not stand.
   ``I can't tell you how horrible the conditions were. There was
no air, no food, no light. We were just like animals,'' said
Zeiger, now a 55-year-old Randolph resident and the president of a
wine importing business. ``All we had was the will to survive, a
positive attitude that eventually we would get out.''
   Suchinsky's farm was near the Zeiger vacation home. Before the
war, Zeiger's mother, Sonya, had befriended the poor farmer, who
appeared odd to many local residents. He used to meditate and was
known to talk to his animals and plants.
   ``My mother always liked him,'' Zeiger said. ``She talked to him
and treated him with respect. She gave him clothes and food, and he
never forgot it.''
   At great risk to himself, Suchinsky helped hide the family. He
begged and stole to get the family food, which he lowered to them
in a bucket.
   ``You have no idea how he was risking his life,'' Zeiger said.
``If they ever found out he was hiding somebody, or had anything to
do with it, they would have shot him right there on the spot.''
   Near the end of the war, Suchinsky and other nearby residents
were forced out by the Nazis. For two days, German soldiers stayed
in the barn just above the family's hiding place. Soldiers poked
bayonets in the straw opening, but never discovered the family.
   The family finally left their hiding place in the summer of
1944, when the Russians liberated the Ukraine. Their home
destroyed, they immigrated to the United States in 1950.
   Over the years, the Zeigers kept in touch with Suchinsky through
letters written by friends of the farmer, who couldn't read or
write. They sent him food and clothing, but never returned to see
him. In recent years, they lost contact and thought he had died.
   But Zeiger's brother, Shelly, discovered on a recent business
trip to Europe that Suchinsky was still alive. Arrangements were
quickly made for the reunion with the farmer, now 83.
   ``I'm very happy and excited, but also a little sad,'' Zeiger
said. ``This trip has awakened a lot of dormant feelings that have
been forgotten for 40 years. It should be a very emotional
experience.''

<HEAD>Opposition Party Vows Nationwide Protests To Protest Alleged
Election Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONCLOVA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition National Action Party
called for nationwide protests today after the state legislature
said the governing party's candidate won a disputed mayoral
election here.
   ``We are implementing a civil disobedience insurgency against
the fraud and this trampling of the democratic system,'' Carlos A.
Paiz Falcon, the National Action candidate, said in a telephone
interview Friday night.
   ``We have called on our supporters across the country to occupy
highways, the international bridges with the United States and
other places on Saturday to condemn the fraud,'' he said.
   Paiz Falcon said Manuel Clouthier, his party's presidential
candidate in the July 6 general elections, would be giving party
activists further ``instructions for civil disobedience.''
   The legislature of the border state of Coahuila announced Friday
that Paiz Falcon lost the May 8 special election by 233 votes to
Benigno Franco Coronado of the Institutional Revolutionary Party
(PRI), the government news agency Notimex reported.
   A special election commission said last weekend that Franco
Colorado had won by 294 votes.
   The opposition party claims Paiz Falcon won the election by 448
votes. He said it has copies of the voting tally and can prove the
results of several precincts were altered.
   More than 23,000 ballots were cast.
   ``They falsified the vote,'' an angry Paiz Falcon said. ``The
PRI was the judge, the Congress, the vote-counters. They supplied
the ballots, the paper, everything. The Congress always says what
the party wants. It was an absolute exoneration of the fraud.''
   The PRI has not lost a presidential or gubernatorial elections
since its founding in 1929.
   In regular elections held last October, the governing party won
the Coahuila gubernatorial race and 37 of 38 mayor's posts at
stake. But the legislature annulled the Monclova results, citing
voting irregulatiries and violence. It called the special elections
for May 8.
   The rival parties have battled for nine years for control of
this steel-producing city of 300,000 people about 200 miles south
of the Texas border at Eagle Pass.
   Its most recent administration was controlled by a bilateral
commission after neither party won the 1984 mayoral race outright.

<HEAD>Anti-Corruption Ministry Invades Other Ministries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's anti-corruption ministry has been
authorized to set up bureaus inside most other ministries and
departments to better observe alleged wrongdoing, an official
report said today.
   The only offices the Ministry of Supervision will not be allowed
to invade are those of the Defense Ministry and the State
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, the Xinhua News Agency
said.
   The Defense Ministry presumably was excluded for reasons of
security, but the report did not say why the economic commission
was exempted.
   The Ministry of Supervision was set up in December 1986 with a
mandate to sniff out cases of corruption and excessive
bureaucratism at all levels of government.
   It has a total of 15,000 employees with offices in most of
China's cities and counties, Xinhua said.
   Nonetheless, cases of corruption have continued to climb, and
this week's Outlook Weekly magazine announced the Communist Party
was launching a new ``full-scale fight'' against corruption in its
ranks.
   It said the campaign would be long-term and wrongdoers would be
punished, but did not give specifics.
   Cases of corruption appear frequently in the official press, on
all scales. Earlier this year, the People's Daily reported that $52
million allocated by the government for aiding povertry-stricken
areas was misspent by local officials on such things as tape
recorders and cars.
   Cases of local officials eating and drinking extravagantly on
the government tab and party leaders pocketing party dues also have
been reported in recent weeks.
   Corruption has burgeoned in part because opportunities have
grown. Under senior leader Deng Xiaoping's 10-year-old program to
revitalize the economy, lower-level governments and state-owned
factories have been given greater autonomy in financial matters.
   At the same time, China's general rise in prosperity has raised
the revenues of these governments and factories, increasing the
temptation to would-be embezzlers.

<HEAD>China Calls Vietnam Withdrawal Announcement Deceptive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China today dismissed as deceptive Vietnam's
promise to withdraw 50,000 of its troops from Cambodia this year
and put the rest under the command of the Vietnamese-installed
Cambodian government.
   The Foreign Ministry statement came two days after the
Vietnamese government announced its withdrawal plan. Vietnam
invaded Cambodia in 1978 and has battled Chinese-backed guerrillas
ever since.
   ``Despite Vietnam's repeated announcement of partial troop
withdrawals from Kampuchea (Cambodia), up to now there has been no
sign of reduction of Vietnamese aggressor troops,'' the Foreign
Ministry said. ``One may suspect whether the same old trick is
being played once again.''
   Vietnam says it has made annual troop withdrawals since 1982,
but the United States says the only genuine one was made last
November when 20,000 troops left Cambodia.
   American officials say the other troop movements were only
rotations.
   The United States estimates there are still 120,000 to 125,000
Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.
   Hanoi said it will pull out 50,000 soldiers from June to
December and put its remaining troops under the command of the
Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia as part of its plan to
pull out completely by 1990.
   However, China said, ``it is entirely deceptive talk for the
Vietnamese side to state that it will further withdraw'' its troops.
   China was a supporter of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge regime that
Vietnam ousted in 1978, and has since been the most vociferous
opponent of Vietnam's presence in Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until the Vietnamese
invasion. During that time it killed millions of Cambodians as it
pursued its policy of radical agrarian communism.
   China now supports a three-party resistance coalition headed by
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was ousted as ruler of Cambodia in a
1970 military coup.
   The coalition, made up of three guerilla groups including the
Khmer Rouge, is recognized by the United Nations as the legitimate
government of Cambodia and receives arms and financial support from
China.
   China reiterated today that the only way to resolve the
Cambodian question is for Vietnam to completely withdraw its troops
and take part in negotiations to establish an independent Cambodian
government.
   Vietnam has said it is an outsider and has no place in
negotiations on Cambodia.
   ``It will lead nowhere for Vietnam to disguise itself as an
outsider,'' China's statement said.
   China has made Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia a condition in
normalizing relations with the Soviet Union. It claims Vietnam
would not be able to maintain its occupation without the Kremlim's
support.
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological and strategic
differences in the 1960s, but relations have improved in recent
years.

<HEAD>Band Leader Sy Oliver Dead At Age 77</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 9th graf, `Oliver James ...' to CORRECT first name to
Melvin.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jazz composer-arranger-band leader Sy Oliver,
one of the big band era's most influential and imitated arrangers,
died Friday at Mt. Sinai Hospital of lung cancer. He was 77.
   Oliver gained fame as trumpeter, vocalist and arranger with the
Jimmie Lunceford Band from 1933 to 1939. ``Sunny Side of the
Street,'' ``My Blue Heaven'' and ``Ain't She Sweet'' were among his
most acclaimed arrangements.
   He arranged for Tommy Dorsey from 1939 through the late 1940s,
using a powerful two-beat style.
   Oliver is ranked with Fletcher Henderson among the era's top
arrangers. His works include ``Opus I,'' ``Tain't Whatcha Do,''
``Easy Does It,'' ``Swing High,'' ``Dream of You,'' ``For Dancers
Only'' and ``Yes Indeed.''
   For a decade from 1947 he worked as a musical director for Decca
and other record companies.
   From the late 1950s he was a freelance arranger for singers
Frank Sinatra, Ethel Merman, Sammy Davis Jr., Peggy Lee, Jo
Stafford, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, the
Andrews Sisters and the Mills Brothers.
   In the 1970s he led a band on a fairly regular basis, including
two lengthy engagements at New York's Rainbow Room. Oliver
concentrated on the music of Lunceford, Dorsey, Fletcher Henderson
and Duke Ellington.
   He retired about three years ago.
   Melvin James Oliver was born Dec. 17, 19l0, in Battle Creek,
Mich., and grew up in Zanesville, Ohio, where his parents taught
music.
   After high school he joined Zack Whyte's band in Cincinnati.
Fellow musicians early on gave him the nickname `Sy,' short for
psychiatrist, because he read extensively and had a large
vocabulary.
   He is survived by his wife Lillian, whom he met when she joined
the singing Clark Sisters on the ``Endorsed by Dorsey'' radio show
in 1946, and two sons.

<TEXT>
   Authorities have captured an inmate who
escaped by taking two guards hostage at gunpoint six days ago, then
changing into a guard's uniform and forcing his way out of a state
prison.
   Michael Day was captured Friday afternoon after authorites
spotted him crossing a bridge from Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso,
Texas.
   Day, 31, of Athens was arrested without incident, said Manuel
Marquez, a supervisor with the El Paso FBI office.
   Day's wife, Sylvia Carraveo Day, was arrested several hours
earlier as she crossed the same bridge, and Mrs. Day's daughter
also was in custody, the FBI said.
   Near the bridge, federal authorities found a blue Cadillac
Seville matching the description of a car Mrs. Day had rented
Sunday night in Columbus, said Ross Correctional Institution
spokeswoman Sandy Price. The car was discovered early Friday,
prompting a stakeout of the bridge.
   Day and his wife were in the El Paso city jail Friday night and
will be arraigned Tuesday before a U.S. magistrate, authorities
said. The FBI, El Paso police and authorities from Ohio and Indiana
took part in the arrest.
   Day, serving an 18- to 25-year sentence for burglary and othger
felonies, escaped from the Ross prison with a pistol officials said
was sent to him in a television set. Karen Albert, 29, of Athens
was arrested and charged Monday with sending the gun.
   Day took his two hostages in a prison jeep to a Holiday Inn
here, where his wife and stepdaughter waited with a getaway car. He
handcuffed one guard to the jeep and the other to a towel bar in a
room registered to his wife, authorities said.
   Authorities believe Mrs. Day has relatives in Texas and possibly
in Mexico, Ms. Price said. Mrs. Day also has a sister in Kokomo,
Ind., according to the Ohio Highway Patrol.
   Ms. Price said the daughter would be released to Mrs. Day's
parents.
   Day had been at the prison since June 1987 and had served at the
Chillicothe Correctional Institute and Ohio State Reformatory in
Mansfield since April 1985. He had married while he was in prison.

<HEAD>Lumber Company Agrees to Stop Clear-Cutting Ancient Redwoods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lumber company has agreed to stop
clear-cutting ancient redwood stands, but the decision drew mixed
reviews from environmentalists and politicians.
   A state senator attacked both Pacific Lumber Co. and
environmentalists, and called the announcement nothing but ``window
dressing and a diversionary tactic.''
   But two other legislators, including state Assemblyman Dan
Hause, who negotiated with Pacific Lumber, called the agreement an
important breakthrough.
   ``The company is the largest private owner of virgin redwood
left in the world, which is why its return to selective logging
practices is so important,'' said Assemblyman Byron Sher, Assembly
Natural Resources Committee chairman.
   Apparently bowing to protests by environmentalists, Pacific
Lumber, located in Scotia, announced Thursday that it has reversed
its 2-year-old policy of clear-cutting the company's 16,000 acres
of virgin redwoods in Humboldt County.
   The company will return to selective logging in virgin forests
and also agreed to consider selling some of the old-growth stands
to public interest groups.
   John Campbell, executive vice president of Pacific Lumber, said
the company agreed to stop clear-cutting _ removing all trees from
an area _ its oldest trees because of its ``sensitivity'' to
environmental and legislative concerns.
   As the agreement was announced, three protesters with the
radical environmental group Earth First! were in their sixth day of
living on makeshift platforms high in redwood trees on the
company's land. The group is attempting to block construction of a
road through an area of virgin redwoods set for clearing.
   Pacific Lumber was purchased in 1985 by corporate raider Charles
Hurwitz, head of the Maxxam Group.
   State Senate Majority Leader Barry Keene, who has represented
the North Coast timber region for 16 years, called the compromise
only a diversion.
   He called it ``a cosmetic truce between a company whose recent
practices can by only described as rapacious and an urban
environmentalist whose knowledge of silviculture is limited to
Sierra Club bulletins.''
   He also complained that the agreement does not include any offer
from Maxxam to restructure the company's $600 million takeover debt
or to guarantee jobs and sustained timber production into the
future.
   Even before the agreement, the state Department of Forestry had
stopped Pacific Lumber from most old-growth cutting.
   Earth First! spokesman Darryl Cherney called the agreement a
slick ``public relations ploy.'' The agreement affects only about
16,000 acres of Pacific Lumber's 200,000-acre holdings, he said.
   ``And it's not even a binding agreement,'' he said. ``The
company had a legislative and bureaucratic gun to its head; so
they're willing to say anything,'' Cherney said.

   Leona Tennyson, whose prized quilt trails
an Australian company in the race to be the world's largest, donned
a combat helmet as she joined the governor in declaring
good-natured ``war'' on her stitching rival.
   ``The fabric of our state is on trial here,'' Gov. George Sinner
said Friday in a brief speech on the Capitol mall that provoked
frequent laughs from about 40 onlookers.
   Among them was Tennyson, wearing a camouflage jacket and
olive-green Army helmet with the legend, ``Battle of the Quilts _
Gen. Tennyson.''
   ``This quilt represents the stuff _ or the stuffing _ that our
people are made of,'' Sinner said. ``When it comes to quilts, we in
North Dakota don't cotton to having the wool pulled over our eyes
by Australia.''
   For months, Tennyson has supervised the assembling of the
9,000-square-foot quilt, which is intended to mark North Dakota's
100th birthday next year.
   More than 7,000 people were involved in making parts of the
quilt, which contains material from all 53 North Dakota counties
and is so large it was brought to a news conference in a moving van.
   The Guinness Book of World Records certified the quilt in March
as the world's largest. David Boehm, American editor for the book,
said Friday its size was recorded as 9,495 square feet.
   However, an Australian quilting company, Hobbytex of Bracken
Ridge in Queensland province, soon weighed in with a quilt
measuring almost 200 square feet larger, Boehm said in a telephone
interview from New York.
   Tennyson says her quilt will be expanded in time to beat the
Guinness book's initial publication deadline in July.
   Sinner compared the quilt contest to the America's Cup yacht
race between the United States and Australia.
   Then he added: ``North Dakota's quilt makers are set to do
battle. They are quilters, not quitters. Even Crocodile Dundee
can't get the best of this crew.''

   The double-breasted black and gray pinstripe
suit Rusty Fuller picked to wear for his high school graduation
might not be in the height of fashion now, but the suit is a family
tradition for graduation.
   Fuller graduated Friday night in the same suit his brother,
father and uncle wore during high school graduations dating back to
1938.
   Fuller said he felt obligated and honored to wear the suit
because he shares middle names with his uncle Virgil, who died in
Germany during World War II.
   Virgil Fuller was the first to wear the suit _ at graduation
from Barnard High School in Barnard, Mo., in 1938. Then Fuller's
father, Cleo, wore the suit at his Barnard High School graduation
in 1949.
   Fuller's older brother, Randy, wore the suit at graduation in
Enid 14 years ago.
   Will the tradition continue?
   Fuller doesn't think so. He says the suit that still looks new
after 50 years probably will be retired now.
   ``Fifty is a good number to quit at,'' he said.
   But his father may have a few other ideas.
   ``We've got some grandsons,'' the elder Fuller said. ``You never
know....''

<TEXT>
   A man who said he was sleepwalking when he drove
14 miles to his mother-in-law's house and killed her was found
innocent of murder charges.
   Kenneth Parks, 24, was acquitted by an Ontario Supreme Court
jury of killing Barbara Woods, 42.
   Parks is still charged with the attempted murder of his
father-in-law, Denis Woods, and remained in custody today.
   Prosecutors said Park's defense was ludicrous.
   Parks, of Pickering, Ontario, was charged with second-degree
murder in the beating and stabbing death of his mother-in-law.
   Mrs. Woods was struck with a tire iron and stabbed four times
and died in bed in her suburban Scarborough home on May 24, 1987.
Her husband, who was choked and stabbed, recovered from his wounds
and testified that he never saw his assailant.
   Defense attorney Marlys Edwardh said that on the night of the
killing, Parks ``plunged into a deep, deep sleep. His next memory
is seeing his mother-in-law's face.''
   The attorney said he then regained consciousness, fled the house
and drove to a nearby police station.
   Staff Sgt. Bob Adair of the Toronto police homicide squad
testified Parks said he had no idea how he got to his in-laws' home
and told officers he had no reason to harm them.
   Testimony indicated Parks, married to the Woods' daughter,
Karen, was under pressure from gambling debts.
   Ms. Edwardh said psychiatric evidence indicated that Parks was
sleepwalking at the time of the killing.
   She said Parks had a history of sleepwalking and asked the jury
to acquit him because he was in ``a sleep-state in which ... there
is no will or conscious mind directing (the activity).''
   The jury did so Thursday after nine hours of deliberation.
   According to testimony, there are about 35 documented cases
worldwide of homicides committed during sleepwalking.
   Crown attorney Cathy Mocha argued Parks must have known what he
was doing, but may have blocked ``the very terrible events'' from
his mind.

Friday. ``We'll be judged by God by how we help our fellow man.''
   Mother Teresa, who opened a new mission south of the city and
visited her sisters who work in the area, has been dubbed ``Saint
of the Gutters'' because of her work with the destitute and the
dying in the slums of India and around the world.
   Her Missionary Sisters of Charity operate more than 30 homes for
the hungry, diseased, orphaned and homeless in 80 countries.
   Mother Teresa said winning the Nobel Peace Prize helped bring
recognition to her work, causing people to talk directly to the
poor rather than talking about them.
   She declined to make a comparison between poverty in other
countries and among Indians, which make up a large portion of the
population in the Gallup area.
   ``We help the poorest of the poor and we do not make comparisons
of the poor anywhere we go,'' she said.
   She also spoke against abortion during her 15-minute talk to
about 1,000 people who jammed the cathedral.
   ``Every woman who gets an abortion never forgets how it was her
own child, and that abortion is the great destroyer of love,'' she
said.

   The school bell rang but this time it was
a wedding bell for a pair of elementary school teachers who booked
their wedding in one of their classrooms.
   Tim Peterson, who teaches fifth grade, and Kamela Britvec, who
teaches first grade, took their wedding vows Friday in her
homeroom, surrounded by their 50 students, who read poetry and sang
during the ceremony.
   The pair met last spring during a Wall Elementary School outing
shortly after Peterson joined the faculty.
   ``We hear kids talk about divorce and bad relationships and we
wanted to show them how a good relationship develops over time,''
said Britvec, 25, just before changing into her peach wedding dress.
   Peterson, 30, said his students thought he was joking when he
first told them the wedding would be at school and during school
hours.
   ``The kids have been in on this relationship since day one,''
Peterson said after the wedding.
   After the ceremony, which was performed by Mayor Donald
Easterday, the children presented the Petersons with a quilt
consisting of panels on which they had drawn pictures before it was
sewn by their parents.
   The children also helped decorate the classroom and halls of the
475-pupil school near the Indiana border with pink, green, blue and
yellow streamers, paper flowers, wedding bells and congratulatory
signs.
   Some of the students took credit for the marriage, the first for
both the bride and groom.
   ``We told him how to ask her out. He was too scared,'' said
Richard Potts, 11, one of Peterson's students.
   While most of the first-graders were as bubbly about the wedding
as their older counterparts, 7-year-old Raymond Whitehead scoffed
at all the fuss.
   ``This is mushy,'' he said. But, he added, ``I'll bet the cake
will be good.''
   While other classes remained in session during the 2 p.m.
ceremony, when school let out about 300 students lined the walkway
outside the building.
   As the couple walked down the path, the children cheered as the
principal rang a school bell.

<HEAD>Three Reporters Barred From Summit Coverage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three reporters from Radio Free
Europe-Radio Liberty have been denied permission to cover the
superpower summit in Moscow, the stations said.
   All three had been granted Soviet visas, Radio Free Europe said
Friday.
   Bill Mahoney, spokesman for the two sister stations based in
Munich, said the stations have asked the State Department to
protest the decision.
   The stations are privately-operated entities which broadcast
news and music to the Soviet bloc. They are largely funded by the
U.S. government.
   The reporters are Wayne Brown, Tom Bodin and Elizabeth Teague.
Bodin is an American, and Ms. Teague is from Britain. The
citizenship of Brown could not be immediately learned.
   Brown was already in Moscow when he was told he would not be
accredited ``and that he shouldn't even have a visa,'' Mahoney told
The Associated Press.
   Bodin and Ms. Teague were about to leave for Moscow when they
were told their visas had been revoked, Mahoney said.
   ``This casts grave doubts on the sincerity of (Soviet leader
Mikhail) Gorbachev's policy of glasnost,'' said the stations'
president, Gene Pell, in Washington. ``Glasnost evidently does not
permit representatives of the largest Western broadcaster to
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to provide a firsthand account
of the summit to millions of listeners.''
   The two stations broadcast in 23 languages to Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union.
   Malcolm E. Forbes Jr., chairman of the Board of International
Broadcasting, called on Gorbachev to reverse the decision. The
Washington-based board oversees the radio stations.
   President Reagan is scheduled to arrive in Moscow Sunday for his
fourth summit with Gorbachev since 1985.

   Former Miss America Bess Myerson was
distracted when she left a department store with $44 worth of
unpurchased items, resulting in her arrest on shoplifting charges,
her attorney says.
   Miss Myerson, who was arrested and charged with shoplifting on
Friday, said she left Hill's Department Store with the nail polish,
earrings and other items because she realized she had left her car
unlocked.
   ``She has been distracted by the pressure of recent
circumstances,'' said Miss Myerson's attorney, Frederick A. Hafetz.
He declined to explain what those circumstances were.
   Miss Myerson, the former cultural affairs commissioner in New
York City, is scheduled to go on trial in September on charges that
she tried to influence the judge hearing the divorce case of her
reported lover, Carl A. Capasso.
   Capasso, who along with Miss Myerson was indicted by a grand
jury in October, is serving a sentence for tax evasion at nearby
Allenwood State Prison Camp.
   Miss Myerson, 63, of New York City, appeared before District
Justice John M. McDermott and was released on $150 cash bail. In
accordance with state law, she was fingerprinted and photographed,
said South Williamsport Police Chief Charles Smith.
   She denied police allegations that she tried to leave the
department store without buying six bottles of nail polish, five
pairs of earrings, shoes and flashlight batteries stuffed in her
purse and shopping bag.
   ``I was leaving the store to lock my car and come back and pay
for the merchandise,'' she told the magistrate.
   Miss Myerson said she would not return for a June 27 hearing and
would pay her fine and costs ``under protest'' through the mail, if
court documents affirm her contention that this is her first such
arrest. The maximum penalty, according to the court, would be a
$300 fine.
   ``If true, it's extraordinarily sad that this could have
occurred,'' New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch said of the charge.
Miss Myerson was his campaign manager in 1977 when Koch was first
elected mayor.
   Earlier this month, the New York Daily News, citing unidentified
sources and records, said Miss Myerson was charged in 1970 with
shoplifting from a London department store and settled the case by
paying a fine of no more than $100 in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Police stood by peacefully as about
2,000 people protested a Danube River power project, a sign of
Communist authorities' increasing tolerance of dissent that does
not challenge them directly.
   A participant in Friday's demonstration said police refrained
from interfering and even cleared the way for marchers as they
wound their way through downtown Budapest to the Austrian Embassy.
   The project in Nagymaros, Hungary, is being financed largely by
Austria.
   The marcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called it an
unusual sign of police cooperation with the young members of the
unofficial Danube Circle ecological group.
   State-run television also took the unusual step of running,
without comment, a one-minute film segment on its main evening
newscast showing protesters arriving at the embassy.
   Among them was biologist Janos Varga, a leader of the ecologists.
   The marchers carried placards and banners demanding a halt to
the project, a joint venture involving hydropower installations on
the Danube at Gabcikovo in Czechoslovakia and at Nagymaros.
   Banners read ``We Want Clear Water,'' ``No Dams'' and ``We Want
Our Danube.''
   Hungarian and Austrian ecologists have said that damming the
Danube and slowing its flow will threaten drinking water reserves
of millions of Hungarians and destroy large areas of riverside
forestland in both Hungary and Czechsolovakia.
   Under an Austrian-Hungarian contract signed on May 29, 1986,
Austrian companies will carry out 70 percent of the $483 million
worth of construction work.
   A delegation of four was allowed to enter the embassy to hand
over a resolution protesting Austria's financial participation,
Austria Press Agency reported.
   It said the Austrian ambassador was not there but promised the
protesters by telephone a written reply to their plea.

<HEAD>Quarter Of Japanese Population Signs Anti-Nuclear Weapons Petition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly one-quarter of Japan's population has signed
a petition calling for total nuclear disarmament, the group
sponsoring the petition said today.
   The signature drive has proven so successful that the United
Nations won't accept the signatures because of a lack of storage
space, said Kazuya Yasuda, a spokesman for the Japan Council
Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.
   He said that since 1985, more than 28 million people have signed
the petition. There are about 120 million people in Japan.
   The council had originally hoped to present the signatures to
the United Nations in New York, but were politely requested not to,
Yasuda said.
   ``It would take about 600 large cardboard boxes to hold all the
signatures, and the U.N. told us it simply doesn't have the space
to store them all,'' he said.
   Instead, the group, supported by the Japan Communist Party,
plans to select 900,000 of the signatures for presentation to the
U.N. by 340 council members who are scheduled to visit New York
early next month.
   The presentation of the signatures is being scheduled to
coincide with the United Nation's third special session on
disarmament. Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita is due to
deliver a speech at the session on June 1.
   ``The signatures symbolize the anti-nuclear weapons attitude of
the Japanese people, but we understand the position of the U.N.,''
Yasuda said.

<TEXT>
   Fourteen state prison employees,
including a cellhouse superintendent and several guards, have been
indicted on charges of possessing and distributing marijuana and
cocaine, officials said.
   The indictment followed a two-month probe by the Illinois State
Police that brought charges against the superintendent, two
captains, three lieutenants and eight other employees, U.S.
Attorney J. William Roberts said Friday.
   Thirteen suspects were arrested Friday morning during a shift
change at Pontiac Correctional Center.
   Their cars and the guards' quarters outside the maximum-security
prison were searched but no drugs were found, said state
Corrections Director Michael Lane. They were released later on
personal recognizance bonds after appearing before a U.S.
magistrate.
   The other suspect, whose name was withheld, was still at large,
Roberts said.
   Prisoners apparently were not involved in the alleged conspiracy
and did not receive drugs, Roberts said.
   Lane said he didn't view the indictments as a black eye on his
agency, but rather as evidence the department is willing to clean
house when necessary.
   ``The number of arrests and prosecutions throughout the
Department of Corrections have increased every year for the past
five years,'' he said.
   ``These are not charges of distributing drugs within the prison.
They are charges of distributing drugs within the community, among
the guard ranks, among each other as well as some instances of
simple possession,'' Roberts said.
   The sealed indictments, returned Thursday by a federal grand
jury here, mark the biggest drug case in the state prison system in
recent years, Lane said.
   The suspects face charges of drug conspiracy, possession and
distribution involving cocaine and marijuana. If convicted, some
could face sentences up to 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine.
   More charges and arrests were expected as the probe continued,
Roberts said.
   The investigation, code-named ``Operation White Shirt,'' was
ordered by Lane, who described it as part of an effort to weed out
illegal drugs from the prison system.
   ``Regrettably, this is apparently what it's going to take to
have a drug-free workplace in the Department of Corrections,'' Lane
said.
   A former corrections officer, Lt. Cesar Roland Chavez, 34, of
Odell, was arrested March 17 in Bloomington on a charge of selling
cocaine. Authorities discovered Chavez kept a ledger said to
contain the names of people who bought drugs from him and those
with whom he conducted legitimate business.
   ``Chavez was a central figure,'' Roberts said.
   Chavez wasn't indicted by the grand jury and Roberts said he
doubts any federal charges will be filed against him.

<HEAD>Police Say There Is Little They Can Do About Money Hand Outs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug dealers are tossing money out of
their fancy cars in an effort to lure youngsters in a poor
neighborhood into the world of drug trafficking, police say, adding
there's little they can do to stop them.
   ``What do you charge them with? Littering? They are. They're
throwing bits of paper out the car window. The problem is everyone
is out there picking it up,'' Assistant City Attorney Peter Warner
said Friday.
   The money handouts probably will not last long, said Lt. Richard
Dugan, head of the narcotics unit. ``Their motive is just to make
themselves look good. Other people look at them and say, `Hey, wow,
look at how rich they are.'
   ``These people aren't enormously rich,'' Dugan said. ``They're
drug dealers, but they're not millionaires. They're driving flashy
cars and that's it. The rest of their life is nothing.''
   Monday through Wednesday, several people police say are believed
to be involved in drug dealing began throwing money _ mostly dollar
bills _ from the sun roofs of a blue Mercedes, a black Mercedes and
a BMW. There were some reports of bills as large as $50 winding up
in the grateful hands of neighborhood youngsters.
   ``If you've been to a parade and you know when the clowns come
by and throw candy and the kids all scurry _ it's the same thing,''
Warner said.
   Even though police know who the people are, they can't charge
them with a crime because no laws have been violated. While it's
not against the law to toss money into the street, officials have
considered citing the suspected dealers for littering or charging
them with creating a public nuisance.
   City Council member Bill Wilson said he received reports of
children ages 10 to 15 flocking after cars and picking up money.
   ``Five dollars, $10, even $20, just tossed out the window,''
Wilson said. ``They even set up contests among the kids and bet on
who will win. I heard that the winners get hundreds of dollars.''
   Police said the amount of money being tossed to children has
been exaggerated. Dugan said he understands the concerns of parents
in the neighborhood, but he cautioned against overreacting.
   ``I think the whole thing is blown out of proportion,'' he said.
``I think it's just a couple of isolated incidents. It doesn't have
any significance as far as I'm concerned.''
   But members of the Summit-University neighborhood say they're
outraged by the handouts.
   ``I am shocked,'' said the Rev. James W. Battle, pastor of Mount
Olivet Baptist Church. ``It's a new one on me. It doesn't make
sense to me. They already have more people selling drugs than they
need.''

   Two brothers who tried to stop a small
grass fire from spreading were electrocuted by a downed powerline
as their father tried desperately to free them, authorities said.
   David Connelly, 18, and his brother, Peter, 19, were driving by
an orchard with their parents, Don and Suzanne Connelly, at about
10 p.m. Thursday when they saw the beginnings of a small grass fire.
   The brothers got out to help but apparently did not see the
12,000-volt live wire that had snapped and started the fire near an
intersection in Sebastopol, about 60 miles north of San Francisco.
   David Connelly apparently picked up the line.
   ``We found it in his hand, said Greg Berry, a Sonoma County
coroner's investigator. ``He probably never knew what hit him.''
   Peter Connelly grabbed his brother and received the full impact
of the current, Berry said.
   Their father was hospitalized with minor burns he received when
he tried to intercede, and their mother also was burned slightly.
   Rescuers with the Twin Hills Fire Protection District's
volunteer fire department said they were unable to free David from
the live wire until the power was shut off an hour later by a
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. crew.

<HEAD>Striking Scriptwriters OK Waiver Contracts With 73 Independent
Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 12 weeks on the picket line, striking
TV and movie scriptwriters for such popular programs as ``The Cosby
Show'' and ``Highway to Heaven'' will return to work under
independent contracts.
   Seventy-three independent production companies had signed the
pacts by Friday, Writers Guild of America officials said. According
to union estimates, the signings will put 200 to 400 writers back
to work.
   WGA members overwhelmingly approved the contracts during voting
in New York and Los Angeles on Thursday, union spokeswoman Cheryl
Rhoden reported.
   Eighty-six percent of the 2,016 guild members who voted endorsed
the proposal, she said.
   Negotiators for both writers and the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers agreed to continue their negotiations to
completely resolve the strike. The two sides were to meet in small
groups today and had scheduled a formal bargaining session with a
federal mediator for Tuesday.
   In the meantime, the producers' group downplayed the signings of
the independent production companies as an insignificant episode in
the 3-month-old strike that has stalled preparations for the new
fall television season.
   Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg estimated the independent
contracts, which give in to writers' key pay demands, cover about 1
percent of the union's working members, and none of the big
production companies that make up the backbone of the industry
group.
   ``Not one alliance member is in this group,'' Steinberg said of
the producers who had signed.
   Actor Michael Landon expressed gratification, however, that
Michael Landon Productions, the company that produces his show,
``Highway To Heaven,'' was able to come to terms with the writers.
   ``The only thing that matters to me is that it ends the strike
for the people that work for my company,'' Landon said. ``They have
all been innocent victims and now they can all get back to work.''
   Producers of other popular shows that signed agreements included
``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,'' ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show,'' and ``ALF.''
   However, Steinberg said many of those who had settled by Friday
were one-person writer-producer companies, including some that
produce TV shows that have been canceled, including the Smothers
Brothers' new comedy show and ``Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.''
   But Ms. Rhoden saw the defections as a break in management ranks
and called it a symbolic victory for striking writers.
   The three-year waiver contracts grant the striking writers' key
demand _ retention of the present formula for the residual payments
that writers get for syndication of one-hour television shows.
   Producers are seeking to tie the amount paid to writers to the
level of success or failure a show encounters in the syndication
market.

   Rain fell along the northern Pacific coast today, ahead of a
strong cold front that brought cold, wet and windy weather to the
Pacific Northwest as thunderstorms rumbled through the Midwest.
   A winter storm watch was posted for this afternoon and tonight
in the Shasta Mountains of northern California as snow levels were
forecast to drop to near 3,000 feet by tonight. A winter storm
watch also was issued for late this afternoon and tonight in the
northern Sierra Nevada.
   A high wind watch was in effect today for western Nevada, where
damaging winds were possible near the eastern slopes of the
northern Sierra Nevada.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended from North Dakota
into Nebraska. Small hail and thunderstorm winds whipped up to 75
mph west of Scottsbluff, Neb.
   A band of showers and thunderstorms reached from south-central
Kansas across the Texas panhandle into southeastern New Mexico and
far western Texas. A few thunderstorms also dotted northwestern New
Mexico and southwest Colorado.
   In Kansas, a tornado touched down early Friday evening in
northwest Kearny County, while hail the size of golfballs pelted
areas near Fowler and near Scott City.
   Small tornadoes blew through south Florida Friday afternoon,
uprooting trees and causing minor property damage, officials said.
A girl who was injured after being tossed by a tornado was in good
condition, officials said.
   Today's forecast called for rain across Washington, Oregon,
northern Idaho and northern California; snow in the higher mountain
areas of northern California; showers and thunderstorms in northern
New England and south Florida; widely scattered thunderstorms,
mostly in the afternoon and early evening, from Montana to western
Texas, and from North Dakota to northwest Wisconsin; strong and
gusty winds over the Great Basin.
   Temperatures were forecast in the 80s or low 90s around much of
the nation; in the 60s and 70s in the Pacific coastal region and
the northern Rockies; in the 70s near the northern Great Lakes and
across Maine; in the 90s to around 100 across the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 84 degrees at
Phoenix, Ariz.

<TEXT>
   Despite attacks on four New York City teachers
in a week, the number of teachers assaulted in the past three years
has decreased, mainly because of an increase in security guards in
elementary schools, officials say.
   The head of the teachers union on Friday acknowledged a downward
trend in attacks but said adding security personnel wasn't enough,
especially in light of the blood spilled during the week.
   ``One attack against a teacher is outrageous and to have four in
one week is just intolerable,'' said United Federation of Teachers
President Sandra Feldman. ``And we're afraid that this is just the
tip of the iceberg.''
   The UFT wants security guards in every school and police
officers deployed in troubled neighborhoods to protect teachers and
children involved in outdoor, after-school activities.
   The union is also pushing for legislation to make any physical
attack on a teacher a felony offense, even if it only involves
pushing or punching, Ms. Feldman said. A bill is pending in the
state Senate.
   She praised new schools Chancellor Richard Green for his
proposal to put metal detectors in five violence-prone schools this
fall.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch announced a ``summit meeting'' for Tuesday
to find out what can be done to improve teacher safety. It will be
attended by the chancellor, union leaders, the five district
attorneys and police commissioner.
   A 17-year-old Bronx youth was arrested Friday night and charged
in the latest attack, in which a physical education teacher was
beaten unconscious with a baseball bat after he confronted an
intruder rifling through students' gym bags outside a Bronx school
Thursday afternoon.
   Gary Smith, 37, was in critical but stable condition at Lincoln
Hospital late Friday after undergoing surgery for a ruptured right
eye. ``At this point we don't know if he'll see or not from that
eye,'' said Robert Medina, a hospital administrator.
   Smith, the fourth city school teacher assaulted during the week,
regained consciousness Friday morning, Medina said. The results of
a CAT scan were not immediately known.
   Teacher Douglas De Marco, who was knifed more than a dozen times
Monday by a mugger in the bathroom of a South Bronx grammar school,
said, ``there's something seriously wrong here.''
   The need for increased security has long been evident to De
Marco, who said he teaches in ``a neighborhood that's known for two
things: heroin and crack.''
   The other attacks included a teacher who was beaten up by a
student, the student's brother and sister; and a 71-year-old
teacher who was injured when she picked up an M-80 firecracker
tossed into her classroom.
   Yet the Board of Education said the number of assaults in city
schools have decreased, mainly because of an increase in security
guards in elementary schools.
   There were 1,322 assaults in the city's 1,000 schools in
1985-86, 1,335 in 1986-87, and 969 so far this year, board
spokesman Bob Terte said.
   Those figures included 337 teachers assaulted in 1985-86, 297 in
1986-87 and 198 this year, he said. The rest were on students and
other school personnel including custodians and cafeteria workers.
   Terte described an assault as anything from a shove against a
wall to more violent incidents.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party daily Pravda has accused the
United States of ignoring its own human rights violations,
contending that 11,000 Americans are jailed in their own land for
political reasons.
   In a brief commentary two days before the scheduled arrival of
President Reagan for his fourth summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
Pravda's Friday editions repeated the Kremlin's longstanding
accusations against the U.S. government.
   Pravda said American political groups and lawyers contend 11,000
people are imprisoned in the United States for political actions in
defense of blacks, American Indians, independence for Puerto Rico
and other causes.
   It lists among those people the Soviets consider political
prisoners Leonard Peltier, an American Indian sentenced for killing
two FBI agents.
   Pravda also said there were 200 Americans jailed for anti-war
activities and that hundreds were arrested in recent demonstrations
in Nevada against nuclear weapons testing.
   Repeating the Soviet government's standard accusations about
U.S. human rights violations, Pravda said millions of people in the
United States are homeless and unemployed. The
   Soviets contend basic human rights include provision of jobs and
housing for everyone.
   The commentary suggested the United States pay attention to its
own problems in guaranteeing human rights before criticizing the
shortcomings in other nations.

   The Senate's Democratic and Republican leaders
are sending a present to Moscow for President Reagan: the first
superpower arms treaty since 1972, with ``a little blue ribbon tied
around it.''
   The Senate voted 93-5 Friday to approve the accord banning
intermediate-range nuclear missiles, far more than the two-thirds
majority required by the Constitution.
   When Majority Leader Robert Byrd and Minority Leader Bob Dole
called Reagan in Helsinki, Finland, to tell him the news, the
president invited them to treaty ceremonies in Moscow next week
during his summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
They accepted on the spot.
   The treaty documents themselves were to be taken to Reagan by
White House chief of staff Howard Baker, who was leaving Washington
today. Byrd and Dole were to leave Sunday for Wednesday's
ceremonial exchange of ratification papers between the two heads of
state.
   ``We are very pleased to be able to give you this in advance of
your stepping on Soviet territory,'' Dole, R-Kan., told the
president.
   ``We'll have a little blue ribbon tied around it,'' added Byrd,
D-W.Va.
   ``This is really America's treaty,'' said Dole, who added that
the lopsided vote reflected the will of all Americans to reduce the
nuclear threat.
   Reagan, in a statement, welcomed the action. But he added, ``I
continue to have concerns about the constitutionality of some
provisions'' added to the resolution of ratification by the Senate.
   That appeared to be a reference to a provision added by Byrd
that sharply restricts the executive branch's future ability to
change its interpretation of treaty provisions. Byrd claimed the
addition made the Senate and the White House ``equal partners'' in
treaty making.
   The provision stems from a dispute between the Senate and the
administration over White House efforts to redefine the 1972
U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to allow greater latitude
for testing of Reagan's Star Wars missile defense program.
   Passage of the treaty _ the first such act since the ABM treaty
was approved 16 years ago _ gave cause for optimism to those who
see the relatively modest INF accord as paving the way for a more
ambitious treaty making deep cuts in the two sides' arsenals of
long-range nuclear missiles.
   ``We are making a breakthrough,'' said Senate Majority Whip Alan
Cranston, D-Calif. ``It is not a substantively significant treaty.
... But it lays the foundation'' for future treaties ``that can
substantially reduce the scale, cost and dangers of this arms
race.''
   Senators voting against the treaty were Republicans Jesse Helms
of North Carolina, Steve Symms of Idaho, Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Democrat Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina.
   Humphrey, a staunch conservative, called the treaty ``President
Reagan's most serious foreign policy mistake'' because it would
weaken allied defense of Western Europe while having little effect
on the Soviet threat.
   ``I believe the Senate has served the country poorly by letting
itself be caught up in summit fever,'' he said.
   Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and John Glenn, D-Ohio, did not
vote. Biden is recuperating from surgery. Glenn missed the vote
because of the death of his mother-in -law.
   The INF treaty, signed by Reagan and Gorbachev in Washington on
Dec. 8, requires the elimination within three years of all nuclear
missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles, and would result
in the destruction of 867 U.S. missiles in Europe and 1,752 Soviet
missiles.

<HEAD>Organizer Says Beauty Contest To Go On In Scaled-Down Form</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sponsor of Beijing's first beauty contest said
today that the event would take place after all, although it will
be scaled down and not be televised.
   Earlier this week, Beijing Television Studio, one of two
sponsors of the capital's first beauty contest since the Communist
takeover in 1949, said the pageant had been canceled because
``conditions for such an event are not yet ripe.''
   But Contemporary Television magazine said today that the finals
would be held as planned on June 5.
   ``We have planned this event out very well. It is not like
beauty contests in other places in China. We are not following the
`beauty contest fever,''' said a spokeswoman who identified herself
only as Guan.
   After the announcement in April that Beijing would host a
contest to select ten ``Girls of Youth and Elegance,'' other cities
quickly followed suit, creating a beauty contest craze in China and
generating much discussion about whether they are appropriate in a
country with a low standard of living.
   Organizers of a beauty contest in Jiangxi province, one of the
nation's poorest, were criticized for hosting the 15-day event when
1 million of the province's farmers were still living in poverty.
   Shanghai called off its contest for a ``Shanghai Maiden'' two
weeks ago, also giving the reason that ``conditions are not ripe.''
   In Canton, organizers said they would go ahead with its beauty
contest, and the final selection for ``Miss Canton'' and ``Mr.
Canton'' were scheduled for today. But the local media was told to
play down the event and the organizing television station also
scrapped plans to televise the contest live.
   Organizers of the Beijing contest planned to choose their ten
beauties through a television contest after 40 days of preliminary
judging.
   However, Guan said the finals would not be televised, reporters
would not be allowed to attend and there would be no news
conference afterwards.
   She did not say if only foreign reporters were to be barred.
   When China held its first beauty contest in 1985 in Canton, only
Chinese reporters were allowed to attend because organizers
apparently were afraid of negative publicity.
   More than 800 Beijing women signed up for the competition, and
the field had been narrowed down to 50 by last week.
   Contestants are judged on their talent in singing, dancing,
reading and answering questions designed to reveal their knowledge
and moral values.

   Daniel J. Edwards sentenced himself to die
when he kidnapped a prominent businessman, buried him alive in a
homemade wooden box and left him to suffocate, prosecutors said.
   After six days of testimony, jurors on Monday convicted Edwards,
31, in the murder and kidnapping of Stephen Small. The panel
deliberated less than one hour Friday before sentencing him to die.
   ``When they rolled that box into the courtroom on Day One, I
would say his fate was decided,'' said defense attorney Thomas
Allen. ``You're always disappointed when the jury doesn't buy your
arguments, but it was no surprise.''
   Nancy D. Rish, 26, who lived with Edwards in Bourbonnais, also
was charged with murder and kidnapping. She awaits trial.
   In closing arguments on the death penalty, prosecutor Frank
Nowicki of the attorney general's staff called Edwards a diabolical
criminal whose cruelty demanded the death penalty.
   He challenged jurors to imagine ``a worse way to die,'' as he
stood in front of the box in which Small's body was found Sept. 4,
1987, two days after he was kidnapped.
   ``Imagine Stephen Small when that lid closed ... his life coming
to an end,'' Nowicki said. ``Imagine the panic he felt, the
helplessness ... to claw, to scrape, to scratch.''
   Edwards ``sentenced himself to death'' by his own actions,
Nowicki said.
   But Allen said there was ``some character'' in Edwards and asked
the jury to spare his life.
   Small, 40, member of a prominent media family and great-grandson
of the late Illinois Gov. Len Small, was lured from his home and
abducted, and a $1 million ransom was demanded in telephone calls
to his wife, Nancy.
   But she was unable to understand her husband's tape-recorded
instructions for delivery of the cash. Police found Small's body in
a wooded area between Kankakee and the Indiana border.
   During the trial, jurors saw the coffin-sized plywood box where
Small suffocated and listened to chilling tape-recordings of Small
saying his kidnapper had put him in a ``grave'' where he would die
unless the $1 million ransom was paid quickly.
   Defense attorney Sheldon Reagan maintained that it was a
``tragic accident,'' in which Small was buried with candy bars,
lights and water but a faulty air-supply system. He also suggested
that someone other than Edwards kidnapped Small.

<TEXT>
   Bald eagles have built a nest in
Massachusetts for the first time in nearly a century, but state
officials say it could be another spring before the birds lay eggs.
   The nest, spotted in a red oak tree near the Quabbin Reservoir,
was built by a young female and Ross, the first male eagle the
state raised and released in its six-year-old attempt to restore a
breeding population of the endangered birds, Ellie Horwitz, a
spokeswoman for the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, said
Friday.
   No eggs have been found, but she said young eagles, which mate
for life, often practice building a nest a year or two before
raising young.
   ``What it really means is that our restoration program is
working the way we had hoped,'' she said.
   The last active bald eagle nest in Massachusetts was reported in
1910 in the Cape Cod town of Sandwich, she said.
   State biologists have been unable to get close enough to the
female to check the band she is wearing, but they suspect she may
be a younger bird, not yet of breeding age, Ms. Horwitz said. It
normally takes about five years for bald eagles to grow into
maturity.
   At least two other states with similar restoration efforts, New
York and Pennsylvania, now have nesting eagles, according to Mary
Beth Moss of the National Wildlife Federation.
   Last year the group counted 8,534 bald eagles in the lower 48
states during its annual eagle census. Totals for this year's count
were not yet available, but 34 were spotted at the Quabbin
Reservoir.

   American fishermen would be allowed to fish in
Soviet waters for the first time under an agreement that Soviet
Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan are expected to
sign during their summit meeting.
   The agreement also would require joint efforts to conserve and
manage Bering Sea fisheries.
   ``We reached agreement in principle two days ago in Moscow,'' Ed
Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries,
said Friday. ``It will be signed during the summit.''
   Wolfe declined to say when the signing was scheduled during the
Moscow summit, which begins Sunday. He spoke by telephone from his
Washington, D.C., office and said he had just returned Thursday
night from Moscow.
   The 10-page pact is a final version of a tentative agreement
reached by the two countries in February.
   ``This is exceedingly important to us economically,'' said Arni
Thomson, executive secretary of the Alaska Crab Coalition in
Seattle.
   Industry and congressional sources said that under the agreement:
   _ U.S. fishermen will, for the first time, have access to crab,
bottomfish and other resources in Soviet waters adjacent to Alaska.
Thomson said his group was negotiating for licenses and space in
Siberian ports.
   ``We would like to be the first to fish in their zone,'' he said
of the 175 U.S. crab boats that have had pinched seasons for nearly
a decade.
   Most deals, he said, would involve joint ventures with the
Soviets in fishing and marketing. The Soviets would gain access to
superior American crabbing techniques and profit from trade at the
ports.
   _ The Soviets, who for years have been allowed to fish U.S.
waters, will have greater access to under-utilized American
fisheries, including mackerel off the U.S. East Coast and hake off
the West Coast.
   _ The United States and the Soviet Union identify as areas of
mutual interest management of fisheries resources in the Bering
Sea, including international waters.
   ``The agreement specifically commits the two nations to consult
and work together on ways to address the effects of unregulated
fishing in the `doughnut hole,''' Rep. Don Bonker, D-Wash., said
Friday.
   The doughnut hole is a triangular-shaped, 50,000-square-mile
chunk of international waters where U.S. officials fear heavy
fishing by several countries could result in the decline of
bottomfish stocks. Another area of mutual interest for the United
States and Soviet Union is management of salmon stocks on the high
seas.
   The agreement is a further example of the improving relations
between the United States and the Soviet Union, said Wolfe.
   The United States and the Soviet Union for the past decade have
conducted joint fishing efforts, with American catcher boats
providing Soviet processing ships with hake, yellowfin sole and
other bottomfish.
   Thomson said the latest agreement could mean millions of dollars
to crabbers, who have had lean years the past decade after Alaska's
king crab fishery inexplicably shriveled up.
   However, he said fishermen, whose boats require a $5,000
investment a day to break even while fishing, are concerned about
costs the Soviets might impose.
   If a fleet of 15 to 20 of the crab boats were to fish for the
Soviets, he said, the boats would need a return of $15 million to
$20 million for six months' work.
   He said Soviets were especially interested in deepwater crab
fishing, a technique American fishermen have learned only the past
five or six years. It is the only way crab in deep water can be
harvested, he said.
   Bonker said the agreement could mean greater cooperation in
collecting fisheries data in the Bering Sea for management and
monitoring the fishing boats from various countries. Both countries
have accused others, including Japan, of pirating their fisheries.
   ``We have a resource that is in U.S. waters, Soviet waters and
international waters,'' said Bonker of the fish that wander across
political boundaries. ``It moves around. We all have a stake in
whether that resource is overfished or depleted.''

   Syrian troops today entered Hezbollah's
south Beirut stronghold but a source said they would not occupy the
pro-Iranian militia's main barracks, where most of the 18 foreign
hostages are believed held.
   Meanwhile, civilians, who had fled their homes in the southern
slums began trickling back to piece together their shattered lives.
   The first Syrian soldiers moved into the 16 square miles of
tin-roofed huts and cement-block apartments on Friday, putting an
end to a three-week battle between Hezbollah and the mainstream
Shiite Moslem militia Amal.
   Sources at the Syrian command said the troops started moving at
midday.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plan
does not cover Hezbollah's main barracks in Hay Madi, where most of
the foreign hostages are believed held by Shiite extremists under
Hezbollah's wing.
   The source said the barracks is considered part of the
demarcation line with Christian east Beirut _ the only area of
south Beirut where Syria will allow either militia to maintain
gunmen.
   A Lebanese security source, speaking privately, said the Syrian
deployment in Hay Madi will ``tighten the grip on Hezbollah. It
means the kidnappers will not be able to move the hostages from one
place to another.''
   The hostages include nine Americans, three Britons, a West
German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified men.
   The two-phase Syrian deployment, implementing a cease-fire
agreed to by Syrian and Iran, ended fighting in the slums narrow
alleys that police say left 300 people dead and 1,000 wounded since
it began May 6.
   Abdul Hadi Hamadi, Hezbollah's security chief and a reputed
kidnapper, escorted Syrian officers into south Beirut Friday. His
public appearance stole the spotlight from the Syrian move.
   Hamadi's brothers, Mohammed Ali and Abbas, are held in West
Germany on terrorist charges. Mohammed Ali is accused of the 1985
TWA hijacking in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39
Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Abdul Hadi, who represents Hezbollah on a four-party committee
set up Friday to supervise the truce, is believed to have
mastermined the January 1987 abduction of two West Germans to swap
them for his jailed brothers.
   One of the Germans, Alfred Schmidt, was released last September.
The other, Rudolf Cordes, 53, is one of the 18 foreign hostages.
   A 900-strong force of Syrian infantry men set up five
checkpoints Friday along a disengagement line between the Shiyah
neighborhood, held by Amal, and the Hezbollah-controlled Ghobeiri
district.
   The demarcation line stretched through two miles of gutted
shops, smoldering cars and bullet-scarred cement block shanties.
Broken power cables dangled the streets, littered with glass shards
and used cartridges.
   The Syrians also erected checkpoints at key road junctions in
two Hezbollah-controlled neighborhoods.
   Civilians today started returning to the Syrian-policed
districts of south Beirut to check their property.
   ``My life's earnings have gone,'' said Azzam Sadeq as he
inspected his gutted apartment that overlooks Hezbollah's positions
across the street.
   A helmeted Syrian soldier, armed with a Soviet-designed AK-47
assault rifle, guarded the entrance to the six-story apartment
building.
   The soldier, who refused to be named, only allowed residents
into the building to ``prevent looting.''
   ``All the doors to the apartments are open. They were either
shot open by gunmen or opened by the pressure of exploding
shells,'' the soldier said.
   Sadeq said fire ``destroyed'' everything in his third floor
apartment.
   ``I don't have furniture anymore. My (two) daughters' books and
clothes were also burned. We don't have enough money to repair the
damage and buy new furniture and clothes,'' he said, his eyes
filling with tears.
   Sadeq said he, his wife and two daughters, fled the apartment
shortly after the fighting broke out. Hezbollah took more than 90
percent of the slums in the fighting.
   ``May God's wrath burn the gunmen, all the gunmen,'' shouted a
gray-haired, middle-aged man as he inspectged his demolished
one-story house. ``They fought in my house. Both Amal and Hezbollah
took turns occupying my house.''
   A young man, an apparent Hezbollah member, told him the party's
spiritual guide Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah ``will compensate
for your losses.''
   ``Neither Fadlallah nor Allah can compensate,'' the man shouted
back. ``May you all roast in Hell.''
   Syria has 25,000 soldiers in eastern and northern Lebanon and
about 7,500 patrolling Moslem west Beirut.
   President Hafez Assad of Syria has become Lebanon's main power
broker during 13 years of civil war, but Iran has used Hezbollah to
challenge Syrian influence among the 1.2 million Shiites, the
largest sect in Lebanon.

   Two British citizens wanted in the United States on
charges of illegally exporting military-oriented high technology
materials from the United States to the Soviet bloc have been
arrested in Rome, police said today.
   One of the men is also under investigation for possible links
with Libya, according to Italy's anti-terrorist police.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the pair
was arrested earlier in the week after arriving at Rome's Leonardo
da Vinci airport on flights from London.
   The two, identified as Brian Butcher, 55, of Southampton, and
Clifford Chadwick, 52, of Rochdale, were taken into custody on
international warrants issued by U.S. Customs Service officials in
Boston, Mass., and Phoenix, Ariz. the Italian police said.
   The suspects were being held in a Rome jail. A formal
extradition request from the United States was expected to arrive
shortly.
   Butcher and Chadwick are charged with fraud and illegal export
of high technology that can be used for civilian and military
purposes, the police officials said.
   The material was allegedly delivered to Romania, Bulgaria and
Poland.
   The officials said they could not divulge the exact type of
material involved, but the Italian news agency ANSA described it as
photocopies of electronic equipment for submarines, planes and
missiles.
   The officials said Chadwick is also under investigation in Italy
on suspicion of involvement in procurement of arms for Libya and
attacks against Libyan dissidents.
   Several opponents of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi have
been assassinated in Italy in recent years.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo met with the
nation's top three opposition leaders today and agreed to overhaul
South Korea's powerful intelligence agencies and keep them from
meddling in politics, his aides said.
   All four men pledged to work together to promote democracy
through ``dialogue and compromise,'' said Chief Presidential
Spokesman Lee Soo-jung.
   Lee said the accord was reached during a four-hour meeting
between Roh, Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil, their
first such encounter since Roh took office Feb. 25.
   The four leaders agreed that South Korea has been moving rapidly
towards democracy since a new constitution was adopted last year,
the spokesman said.
   The leaders also said South Korea should continue to seek
reforms in all sectors and rejected violence as a means to change
society, Lee said.
   All three opposition leaders said the meeting was beneficial.
   Kim Dae-jung, head of the largest opposition group, the Party
for Peace and Democracy, called the meeting ``sincere and frank.''
   The 62-year-old Kim said, however, he had failed to get Roh's
promise to free ``all prisoners of conscience.''
   Roh said he would set free ``as many political prisoners as
possible'' if they repent but made it clear that it would be
difficult to release ``those who committed serious crimes such as
murder and arson,'' Lee said.
   Roh pointed out that 1,275 political offenders had already been
set free under three government amnesties last year and early this
year.
   Government officials said between 250 and 300 people are
currently in jail, serving terms or awaiting trial for political
offense. Dissidents claim the number is much higher.
   Roh pledged to reform South Korea's influential state security
apparatus, which has been responsible for arresting many of the
political prisoners.
   South Korea's intelligence agencies have exerted a strong
influence on past governments.
   As the governing party candidate, Roh defeated the three
opposition leaders last December in South Korea's first direct
presidential elections in 16 years. Roh won with only 36.6 percent
of the vote.
   The elections were called after the government of former
President Chun Doo-hwan, under mounting public pressure, agreed to
opposition demands for sweeping democratic reforms.
   A new constitution was subsequently adopted in a national
referendum.
   The opposition made a strong comeback in legislative elections
in April, stripping Roh's governing party of its parliamentary
majority for the first time in South Korea's 40-year history.
   Since the legislative election setback, Roh has promised to work
with the opposition.
   The political leaders exchanged views on this fall's Olympic
Games in Seoul and agreed to do their best to persuade North Korea
to take part in the Games, Lee said. Roh made it clear, however,
that it would be impossible to make North Korea a co-host.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Games unless it is made
a co-host.
   The political leaders also agreed to investigate a 1980 civiling
uprising in the southern city of Kwangju that left nearly 200
people dead, the spokesman said.
   And they agreed to investigate past official corruption, though
Roh said he hoped any such probes would not include former
President Chun, who stepped down at the end of his term in South
Korea's first peaceful transfer of power.

   The death toll from flooding in
northeastern India rose to 26 today and officials in neighboring
Bangladesh said thousands of families were rendered homeless by
rivers that overflowed their banks.
   Heavy rain continued to hamper rescue workers in the northeast
Indian state of Assam, where the Brahmaputra River and its
tributaries have been rising for six days, the Press Trust of India
reported.
   Thousands of acres of farmland have been inundated and thousands
of families have moved to make-shift camps on higher ground, the
news agency said.
   In Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, officials in the Water
Control Ministry said rivers were being swelled by the annual snow
melt from the Himalayan mountains and heavy, pre-monsoon rains.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said more
than 200,000 acres of land had been flooded. They said that if the
water did not recede soon, some of the country's rice crop would be
destroyed.
   More than 5,000 people were reported marooned in the tea-growing
district of Sylhet in northeastern Bangladesh.
   Rice is the staple food for Bangladesh's 105 million people. The
country last year was hard-hit by floods. Nearly one-quarter of its
population was dislocated at the height of rain problems last
summer.

<HEAD>Dinar Devalued 23.9 Percent, Massive Price Increases Introduced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia today devalued its
currency by 23.9 percent and instituted massive price increases as
part of an austerity program instituted to battle a 170 percent
annual inflation rate.
   Gasoline prices went up by an average 36.1 percent, electricity
by 31.4 percent, postal services by 28.1 percent, rail transport by
38.5 percent and coal by 30.3 percent, a government announcement
said.
   The government also lifted price controls for about 60 percent
of the goods under a price freeze since last November. It said
those prices can now be determined by the market.
   The prices of such staples as cooking oil, flour and milk
remained frozen and will continue to be under government control,
said the announcement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency.
   The economic package also includes a reduction of wages by up to
30 percent at a time when 80 percent of manufacturers in the
country have already announced higher prices for their products.
   Devaluation, price rises and wage cuts are a part of an
austerity program decreed in conjunction with the International
Monetary Fund.
   In addition to seeking to eventually curb inflation, the program
intends to help repay the country's $20 billion debt by introducing
a more market-oriented economy. Inflation is expected to increase
by between 8 and 12 percent as a result of the price increases.
   The unpopular measures are likely to contribute to a further
decline of living standards, which have already fallen by one-third
since 1980.
   Labor unrest is also expected to grow.
   In the past several weeks, after the government unveiled the
austerity program, several thousand workers staged a wave of
strikes to protest the planned reduction of wages.
   Yugoslavia registered an all-time record of over 1,600 strikes
last year. More than 300,000 workers were involved.
   The austerity program was originally scheduled to start May 15,
but the government said it was putting it off because of the lack
of new loans expected from Western creditors.
   In its announcement, the government did not say if it had
obtained about $400 million of new loans from Western creditors
previously said to be necessary to start the program.
   The lowering of the exchange rate of the Yugoslav national
currency, the dinar, which took effect today, is based on the May
27 dinar value. According to the official daily exchange list, $1
is now worth 1,922.75 dinars.
   The dinar cannot be converted into foreign currencies in
Yugoslav banks.
   The lower dinar is intended to improve the foreign trade
imbalance by making Yugoslav goods cheaper abroad. However, the
devaluation makes imports too expensive for Yugoslavs.
   The last dinar was last devalued in November, but it continued
to lose its value daily against foreign currencies. In relation to
the American dollar, its value has dropped over 250 percent in a
year.
   The gasoline price hike resulted from the devaluation of the
dinar, which makes foreign oil purchases more expensive in local
currency. The retail price of gasoline is now the equivalent of
about $2 a gallon.

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Called Into Session to Ratify Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Soviet, the Kremlin's nominal
parliament, was called into special session today to ratify the
U.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate and shorter range nuclear
missiles.
   The session came a day after the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly
approved the document and appeared aimed at securing approval of
the treaty before the arrival Sunday of President Reagan.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev are expected to
formally exchange final copies of the document in Moscow on
Wednesday.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told his
colleagues on the lawmaking body at the start of the session that
the Soviet Union was not responding to pressure from the United
States and that the treaty would free both countries' resources for
peaceful uses.
   A Foreign Ministry briefing for reporters at the summit press
center was abruptly canceled and journalists were informed that the
Supreme Soviet was meeting.
   Friday the U.S. Senate voted 93-5 to approve the first arms
treaty between the superpowers in 16 years.
   Earlier today, the head of the Soviet Peace Committee welcomed
the U.S. Senate's approval and predicted Soviet ratification would
follow shortly.

<TEXT>
   The emergency room at the James C. Giuffre
Medical Center has been allowed to reopen as state health officials
relax restrictions on the hospital where admissions were banned 15
days ago.
   But the Pennsylvania Department of Health continues to restrict
the number of medical and surgical patients at the hospital to 80.
The hospital has the capacity for 148 such patients.
   The emergency room was reopened ``because our staff is pleased
with the continuing progress made at the facility over the past
week,'' Bruce Reimer, a health department spokesman, said Friday.
   The state banned most new admissions to Giuffre on May 12 and
ordered it to shut down its emergency room and surgical operations
after inspectors found serious lapses in the quality of care. The
department found 124 deficiencies, including 12 questionable deaths
after surgery and 29 cases of unnecessary surgery.
   The state held the hospital's board of directors and chief
executive officer Dr. James C. Giuffre responsible and ordered
personnel changes.
   On Wednesday the hospital named a new 15-member board of
directors, ousting Giuffre and naming Philadelphia businessman G.
Fred DiBona as board chairman.
   The emergency room reopened at 1 p.m. Friday, immediately after
the hospital was notified that the state ban had been lifted, said
William L. Vazquez, the hospital's president.
   The move Friday effectively removes the ban on admissions, which
had been partially lifted last week when the state allowed surgery
to resume.
   The hospital's drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit and its
outpatient primary-care clinic were unaffected by the state
restrictions.

   A 24-year-old man was killed and dismembered in
his girlfriend's apartment apparently after he threw the woman's
cat against the wall and punched a television screen, police said.
   Lori McLuckie, 26, was arrested Friday after the dismembered
body was found on the living room floor of her apartment, police
said.
   McLuckie, who is pregnant, was jailed for investigation of
first-degree murder and ordered held without bond.
   The man's identity was withheld until relatives could be
notified, but authorities said he was a Denver resident.
   Detective Calvin Hemphill said police were called to the
apartment on a tip and found the victim's torso and head on a piece
of plastic on the floor. A search turned up the victim's limbs,
wrapped in plastic bags and deposited in several trash bins in the
neighborhood.
   Police believe the man was stabbed to death, possibly with a
kitchen knife, and then was dismembered.
   ``It was a very grotesque scene,'' said Detective Capt. James
Fitzpatrick.
   Police said they were told by an unidentified informant that the
victim was stabbed to death after a violent argument in which he
grabbed McLuckie's cat and threw it against the wall, then swung
his fist into the television set.

   A group of Jewish refuseniks is planning a series
of protests during the Moscow summit to draw attention to the
plight of Soviet Jews denied permission to emigrate.
   ``The refusals have pounded down like hail'' since President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev met last December in
Washington, said activist Marina Durnovo.
   Reagan arrives here Sunday for the five-day summit.
   The group plans three demonstrations, at 6 p.m. local time at
the Lenin library in downtown Moscow.
   Many well-known Jewish activists have been allowed to emigrate
from the Soviet Union under Gorbachev, leaving behind many others
who have been denied permission to leave.
   Activist Yuri Semenovsky, said he had conducted a survey of some
of the estimated 2 million Jews in the Soviet Union, and concluded
that 30 percent of them would like to leave. His study appeared in
the March issue of ``Referendum'', an independent journal published
by the ``Press Club Glasnost,'' a dissident organization that tests
the limits of Gorbachev's reforms.
   Semenovsky said that 200,000 Jews had already applied to leave
the country, and that many, like himself, had been harassed by the
authorities and forced out of their jobs, and that many others were
afraid to ask.
   The number of Jews receiving emigration visas rose to 1,400 this
winter and jumped to 1,800 in April, said Yevgeny Rubinstain,
another member of the group.

   Israeli soldiers today fired tear gas and
rubber bullets at Palestinian protesters who threw stones and
bottles at a refugee camp's army headquarters in the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   Gaza City was paralyzed by a general strike, and groups of
Palestinian youths threw stones at cars and set tires ablaze.
   In the occupied West Bank, activists of the Israeli left-wing
Peace Now movement drove in two convoys towards the area's largest
city of Nablus. The movement planned to stage a symbolic withdrawal
from the area.
   Since anti-occupation unrest broke out Dec. 8, Israeli soldiers
have killed 198 Palestinians. Two Israelis also have died.
   In the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, a firebomb was
thrown at an army patrol, an Arab reporter said. He said soldiers
entered and searched homes, confiscating identity cards of about 25
residents.
   Several Palestinians were ordered to park their vehicles in
front of the military administration building in the camp to
prevent stone-throwing attacks, he said.
   Later, youths attacked army headquarters in the camp with stones
and bottles, and troops responded by firing rubber bullets and tear
gas grenades. There were no reports of injuries.
   The protests came in an apparent response to the calls made by
underground leaders of the Arab uprising in the occupied lands, who
have called on their followers to challenge the troops and raise
outlawed Palestinian flags.
   This week, Israel's Supreme Court upheld the army order barring
Peace Now from displaying signs, distributing leaflets, meeting
with the Arabs or passing through West Bank towns.
   In protest, Peace Now held a demonstration on the outskirts of
Jerusalem, removing signs from the cars, Israel radio said.
   The radio also reported that the army on Friday uprooted several
rows of trees in the West Bank village of Shuweika, claiming these
served as a shelter for firebombers.
   Earlier this week, an Arab woman and her son were burned to
death near Shuweika after their car was hit by a firebomb. Soldiers
were patrolling in the area at the time, and the firebomb had
apparently been intended for an Israeli vehicle.
   On Friday, a 3-year-old Palestinian girl and two teen-agers died
after being caught up in clashes with Israeli soldiers.
   A leading Palestinian journalist was released from jail Friday
and called on Israel to ease its crackdown in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip and launch peace negotiations through an
international conference.
   Rajwan Abu Eish, head of the Arab Journalists Association in the
occupied lands, had been jailed without trial six months ago.
   Also Friday, hundreds of Arabs waving Palestinian flags and
black flags of mourning marched to the house of Ahmad Wazir, the
cousin of the assassinated PLO military chief, Khalil Wazir, an
Arab reporter said.
   Wazir, better known as Abu Jihad, was gunned down last month
outside Tunis, Tunisia, reportedly by Israeli commandos.

   The collective Soviet presidency today unanimously
ratified the superpower treaty scrapping both nations' medium-range
nuclear missiles, swiftly following the U.S. Senate's approval a
day earlier.
   Approval by both nations of the accord signed at the Washington
summit in December clears away any doubt about the treaty's fate
and strikes a positive note on the eve of President Reagan's
arrival for his summit with Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorachev in
Moscow.
   The session of the presidium was shown live on Soviet television
_ something that rarely has been done in the past.
   ``The present summit opens up new vistas,'' said Lev N. Zaikov,
a Politburo member and Moscow Communist Party boss, adding that the
meeting ``inspires us with hope that even greater agreements will
be reached.''
   A session of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a 36-member
body headed by President Andrei A. Gromyko, met in special session
and cast a traditional unanimous vote in favor of the pact.
   The U.S. Senate voted 93-5 on Friday to approve the accord, and
a Soviet official predicted early Saturday that ratification by the
Kremlin would follow shortly.
   The Presidium session began less than 16 hours after the Senate
action.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze hailed the treaty as the
product of the Kremlin's policy of ``New Thinking'' on
international matters. Shevardnadze said the funds saved on weapons
production would add 300 million rubles ($508 million dollars) for
non-military uses like environmental protection and social services.
   The foreign minister said the treaty was not the result of
pressure on the Soviet Union applied by the United States, but a
mutually beneficial pact that would advance stability.
   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev said the treaty could herald
the start of restructuring U.S.-Soviet relations, but ``there are
forces in the United States and Europe opposed to disarmament.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the
ratification by both sides ``was a very good prelude to the summit
here in Moscow.''
   Reagan and Gorbachev plan to exchange the final texts of the
treaty as ratified by each side at a ceremony Wednesday after their
talks on arms control, human rights, regional issues and superpower
relations.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini today asked
Iran's parliament to do more for the nation's poor after
legislative elections that boosted radicals seeking economic reform.
   Iran's leader also renewed his declarations that the 7{-year-old
Persian Gulf war with Iraq would be settled on the battlefield, not
at the negotiating table.
   He made his remarks in an inaugural message read to the
270-member Majlis, or parliament, by his son and aide, Ahmed.
   Earlier, President Ali Khamenei acknowledged that Iraq won
victories recently in the ground war but said they would not affect
final outcome of the conflict.
   The 87-year-old Khomeini, who was reported to be ill, asked the
Majlis to ``simplify'' Iran's complicated government system.
   ``I hope that by close cooperation between the Majlis, the
Council of Guardians and other experts, the problems of the
deprived can be solved,'' he said in the message read by his son
and carried by Tehran radio. Laws are submitted to the Council of
Guardians after they pass through parliament.
   In Iran, ``deprived'' is a codeword for urban and rural poor.
They were a major force in the revolution that overthrew Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979.
   Khomeini has increasingly come down on the side of the radicals.
They favor price controls, a minimum wage, land redistribution and
other measures to help deal with runaway inflation and economic
inequities.
   They are opposed by conservative believers in private property,
many of whom are clerics or merchants and whose views are heavily
represented in the Council of Guardians.
   The parliament was elected in two rounds of balloting in April
and earlier this month. The exact breakdown of power blocs was not
yet known, but based on announced results the radicals clearly
gained influence.
   The new, four-year parliament is the third since the revolution.
   Referring to Iran's armed forces, Khomeini said in his message:
   ``The combatants must continue their fight by depending on their
faith in God and their weapons,'' he said. ``The fate of the war
will be decided on the war fronts, not through negotiations.''
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that the
president, Khamenei, also addressed the inaugural session and told
the deputies they must work for social justice.
   Tehran radio earlier said Khamenei told worshipers in a prayer
sermon Friday on the campus of Tehran University that ``war has a
two-sided aspect.''
   ``You will not find, in any of the wars in the world which last
a long time, one side always winning and the other always losing.
If one side constantly wins and the other constantly loses, the war
will not last. It will be over,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The remarks followed two major battlefield defeats for Iran: the
recapture by Iraq of the southern Faw peninsula April 18, and of a
chunk of Iraqi territory east of the port city of Basra on
Wednesday.
   Khamenei said, Iraq ``has had one or two victories and
successes. These successes of the enemy are not beyond our
expectation.''
   The language used by the Iranian president to concede the
defeats was unusually blunt, reflecting the scale of the reverses
suffered by Iran since mid-May.
   In addition to the defeats in the ground war, U.S. forces on
April 18 destroyed Iranian offshore platforms, sank a patrol boat
and crippled two frigates in a series of clashes in the Persian
Gulf.
   Iran's state-run media already had conceded that Iranian forces
withdrew from some of their positions east of Basra. And after the
Faw battle, it indirectly admitted setbacks by accusing United
States forces of intervening on Iraq's side.
   But Khamenei assured his audience that Iran would prevail.
   ``We have no doubt that the nation which will have the last word
and which will inflict the last blow is this same heroic and
martyr-nurturing nation which, in the course of these years, has
not for a moment felt a sense of weakness in confronting the big
powers,'' he said.
   ``The great movement by the people towards final objectives and
final victory has been charted by the imam (Khomeini) and the
people are willingly and diligently following this path.''
   Western military and political analysts have said it is too
early to tell whether the string of defeats will represent a
turning point in the war.
   But they say the setbacks have badly jolted the Tehran
leadership at a time of growing economic woes and a power struggle
between radicals who want a state-run economy and conservatives who
back private property rights.

   Police killed a Turkish soldier today
after he tried to rape a Greek Cypriot woman, shot to death a
national guardsman and wounded another, Greek Cypriot officials
said.
   Government-run radio said police stormed the woman's house in
the village of Athienou southeast of Nicosia several hours after
the guardsmen were shot. They then fatally shot the soldier after
he tried to open fire on police, said the broadcast, quoting
government officials.
   The house lies near the volatile Green Line that separates the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations on this Mediterranean island.
It was the second fatal clash near the Green Line in a week.
   U.N. spokesman Charles Gaulkin said investigations of today's
violence were under way.
   Greek Cypriot police said the woman escaped unharmed after the
break-in around dawn. They said the Turkish soldier was dead at the
scene.
   The National Guard said the intruder was a Turkish soldier who
tried to rape the woman. About 30,000 Turkish soldiers are
stationed on the island.
   The dead guardsman was identified as Charalambos Charalambous,
about 18 or 19 years old. The injured guardsman, Ioannis Kaleshis,
was taken to Larnaca General Hospital and listed in serious
condition.
   On May 21, U.N. troops from the Austrian contingent here shot to
death a Turkish Cypriot, Hussein Kafa. The United Nations said Kafa
had wounded an Austrian peacekeeper near the mixed Greek-Turkish
village of Pyla.
   Later that day, a second Austrian peacekeeper was wounded by two
of Kafa's relatives while he guarded an Austrian post, authorities
said. The two relatives were later taken into custody in connection
with the incident.
   Pyla is the only village where Turkish Cypriots and Greek
Cypriots still live together despite the 14-year-old partition of
the island.
   After the incident, Maj. Gen. Gunther Greindl, the Austrian
commander of U.N. peacekeepers in Cyprus, dismissed Turkish Cypriot
complaints against him.
   ``I consider the charges made against the United Nations Force
in Cyprus generally, and me personally, are totally unjustified,''
he said in a statement.
   Rauf Dentash, president of the northern Turkish Cypriot
breakaway state, had charged that Greindl ordered Austrian troops
to harass Kafa and held the U.N. commander responsible for the
fatal shooting.
   Turkish Cypriots planned a rally in Pyla on Sunday to protest
Kafa's killing.
   Troops from Turkey invaded the northern section of this
Mediterranean island in 1974 after Greek Cypriot activists staged a
coup, seeking to unite the island with Greece.
   Turkish Cypriots make up about 18 percent of the island's
population of 650,000 people. Denktash's government is recognized
only by Turkey.

<DATELINE>ABOARD USS VINCENNES IN THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S.
Navy has for the first time introduced to the Persian Gulf its
billion-dollar Aegis cruisers, one of the fleet's most
sophisticated warships.
   The move may lead to another scaling back of the American force
now operating in the waterway.
   Capt. Will C. Rogers III, skipper of the Vincennes, said that
despite its many capabilities _ including what U.S. officers call
the most powerful surveillance radar system afloat _ his ship did
not represent an escalation of the U.S. armed presence in the
war-torn waterway.
   ``Let's face it. It's a low level threat,'' Rogers said,
referring to Iran. ``We don't consider the Iranians an enemy. We're
not at war with them.''
   While Rogers described his ship's main role in the gulf as
anti-aircraft surveillance, several officers and crew members said
they were mystified as to why their ship was deployed here and by
the haste in which the assignment was ordered.
   The Vincennes had just one day's notice and spent only 90 hours
in port preparations before making a 32-day, 13,00-mile dash across
the Pacific from San Diego, Calif., to the Gulf of Oman, where it
arrived May 22.
   After arriving in ``Goo'' _ as U.S. sailors call the Gulf of
Oman _ the Vincennes did not enter the Persian Gulf immediately, as
expected by some of its officers and crew.
   The vessel entered the gulf only on Saturday. Some officers said
the delay apparently occurred because senior U.S. officials did not
want the powerful warship to sail through the Strait of Hormuz, the
gateway to the gulf, while Iran was conducting several days of
naval maneuvers in the area.
   The 9,400-ton Vincennes, one of ten ships of its type now in
commission, sailed into the gulf overnight. With its crew of 385
positioned at battle stations, the ship threaded the so-called
``Silkworm Envelope'' in the narrow strait, where Iran has deployed
mobile batteries of Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles along
the coast.
   The ship passed a Panamanian-flagged tanker still on fire after
an Iranian attack 20 hours earlier. Salvage tugs sprayed water on
it as the Vincennes sailed past about four miles away. The attack
was the second on a neutral tanker in the last two days and the
fourth since May 18.
   According to Rogers, the Vincennes is the replacement for the
guided missile cruiser Wainwright and will take over the
anti-aircraft surveillance role performed since February by that
ship, one of five leaving the gulf in the next few days.
   But with five other ships, including the destroyer John Hancock
and four guided missile frigates entering the waterway, the overall
strength of the Navy's gulf-based squadron, known as the Middle
East Force, will increase by a net of one, to 17.
   Although he described his ship as making ``essentially a
one-for-one'' switch with the Wainwright, it will bring to the
war-torn gulf a ``multi-mission capability'' equivalent to several
U.S. warships now on duty there, Rogers said.
   ``Aegis'' is a state of-the-art, computerized radar surveillance
and missile weapons system that is designed to enable the ship to
manage a battle situation in defense of an aircraft carrier battle
group.
   ``Putting this ship with its radar into the gulf will put a lot
of battle management on the scene. Maybe we will be able to reduce
the force level in the gulf and back away from the recent
tensions,'' Rogers told members of a Pentagon news media poole
aboard the Vincennes.
   He said the gas turbine-powered ship burned a million gallons of
fuel on the trip as it sailed at 23 mph on the 32-day voyage.
   Crew members said the cruiser monitored the naval maneuvers
along the Iran coast from about 15 miiles away. They said they
could see aircraft and one large warship, which was tentatively
identified as one of the two World War II-vintage, U.S.-built
destroyers in Iran's navy.
   Tensions in the gulf have run high since U.S. and Iranian naval
forces engaged in a serious clash on April 18.
   Iran lost a total of six craft sunk or disabled in the April 18
battle with the U.S. Navy, including two if its four best frigates.
One of those has since been seen operating in the Hormuz Strait.
   At least one of the American-built destroyers was known to be
operational, although it had not been reported in action since last
year when it fired a missile at an aircraft, apparently Iraqi.

   Heart attacks were the No. 1 killer of
firefighters who died in the line of duty last year, striking down
56 of 124 fatally injured firefighters, according to the National
Fire Protection Association.
   The number of firefighters who died in the line of duty in 1987
was up 9.7 percent over the previous year and the highest since 134
died in 1981, the group reported Friday.
   There were 72 volunteers and 52 career firefighters among the
1987 fatalities, according to the annual report of the non-profit

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher confided to a
guest recently that piled on her bedside table are collections of
religious and philosophical essays.
   The repercussions have been enormous. There are major speeches
aligning her rigorous policies of free enterprise and self-reliance
with Christian tenets. Biblical allusions are traded in Parliament,
and there is furious public debate about whether God is on the side
of Thatcherism.
   Aides say the Thatcher crusade to stake out the moral high
ground for her right-wing policies partly reflects anger and
resentment at the most persistent criticism of her nine-year
tenure: that she is uncaring, favors the well-off, and has divided
Britain.
   Mrs. Thatcher, an Anglican who grew up under the strict
Methodism of her father, a small-town grocer, has launched the
moral offensive along with a radical third term program described
as ``verging on the wicked'' by David Jenkins, the bishop of Durham
in northern England.
   It includes a welfare shake-up, big tax breaks for the
better-off and plans for an unpopular local tax.
   Gerald Priestland, a leading author on religious affairs, sees
Mrs. Thatcher's public espousal of ``basic corner shop Wesleyan
Methodism'' as seeking a deeper foundation for her political
philosophy.
   Priestland, 60, a former religious affairs correspondent for the
British Broadcasting Corp., said Mrs. Thatcher button-holed him
last month at a party at her 10 Downing St. residence.
   ``She confided that she has at her bedside the latest collection
of essays by the chief rabbi, by (English Roman Catholic leader)
Cardinal Basil Hume and by the English theological writer C.S.
Lewis,'' Priestland said in a telephone interview.
   ``She is now taking an intense interest in that sort of thing. I
think it is partly because as we get older, we do, don't we?
   ``But she also sees her premiership as more than a pair of dates
and hoping it will be regarded as something of a movement.
   ``She is not ashamed of Thatcherism and is probably trying to
dig its foundation a bit deeper.''
   Politicians in Britain _ a nominally Protestant country where
only about 10 percent of the 56 million people attend church
regularly _ rarely make references to religion. Being an
acknowledged agnostic is no handicap to election.
   Mrs. Thatcher, however, has dotted recent speeches with passages
on family life, morality and personal responsibility.
   In a major address to the assembly of the Church of Scotland
this month, she declared that the message of the Old and New
Testaments is that ``we must work and use our talents to create
wealth.''
   ``It is not the creation of wealth that is wrong, but the love
of money for its own sake,'' said the 62-year-old Conservative
Party leader.
   ``We simply cannot delegate the exercise of mercy and generosity
to others.''
   Quoting from her recent reading, she added, ``Christianity is
about spiritual redemption, not social reform.''
   In testy exchanges in the House of Commons, opposition Labor
Party leader Neil Kinnock taunted: ``Which passage of the Bible
inspired all that? Could it have been Matthew 27:24, when Pilate
took water and washed his hands?''
   She retorted: ``You debase everything.''
   The archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Robert Runcie, gave
a guarded endorsement to the Thatcher forays into religious
philosophy, saying he agreed with her advocacy of wealth creation.
   ``But I would want to ask a little more about the questions of
making wealth and at same time dividing a society in a way which
makes the people who have fallen behind, through no fault of their
own, feel on the edge of things,'' Runcie said in a radio interview.
   Methodist leaders were less charitable after Mrs. Thatcher, in
another speech Wednesday, likened her policies to the philosophy of
John Wesley, who founded Methodism 250 years ago. She quoted Wesley
as saying, ``Gain all you can ... give all you can.''
   ``Mrs. Thatcher is casting about for a reply to the criticisms
that have come from the churches,'' said Methodist Church secretary
general, the Rev. Brian Duckworth. ``Wesley's sermon was a ...
warning against greed.''
   Labor's Kinnock said Mrs. Thatcher's latest ``special brand of
born-again conservativism ... has nauseated people right across the
political and religious spectrum.''
   Social Democratic Party leader David Owen jibed: ``There's no
political party with a through line to God.''

   China, which has been almost untouched by AIDS,
has set up a foundation to raise funds for AIDS research and
prevention, an official report said Saturday.
   The English-language China Daily said the AIDS Research
Foundation of China would be led by the president of the Chinese
Academy of Preventative Medicine, Chen Chunming, and will seek to
raise funds to prevent the fatal disease from spreading among
China's more than 1 billion people.
   Only three confirmed deaths from AIDS have been reported in
China: an Argentine tourist, a Chinese man who had returned from
New York, and a 13-year-old hemophiliac boy who reportedly was
infected by a blood product imported from the United States.
   The China Daily said three other Chinese, including two
children, have tested positive for the AIDS virus but have not
developed the disease.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrom, is caused by a
virus that attacks the body's immune system, leaving it vulnerable
to infection. The virus most often is transmitted through sexual
contact, contaminated blood or sharing contaminated hypodermic
needles. There is no known cure.

   Seven lawsuits stemming from the November crash of
Continental Flight 1713 have been settled in federal court, but the
terms were not disclosed.
   Chief U.S. District Court Judge Sherman G. Finesilver said
Friday that seven cases had been settled and that discussions are
ongoing in two more in an effort to pare down the number of suits
that will be tried.
   The majority of some 30 lawsuits filed since the DC-9 crashed at
Stapleton International Airport on Nov. 15 have been brought in
federal courts in Denver and Boise, Idaho.
   The Boise-bound plane crashed while attempting to take off
during a snowstorm, killing 28 and injuring 54.
   Named as defendants in the lawsuits were Continental Airlines
and its parent firm, Texas Air Corp. The plane's manufacturer,
McDonnell-Douglas Corp., also was named in some suits.

   Evan Mecham, who was impeached and ousted
as governor of Arizona, returned to his roots and told Altamont
High School graduates to study the Constitution and understand the
freedoms that have made America great.
   In Friday's commencement address Mecham made no reference to the
problems that led to his impeachment.
   In his 20-minute address, Mecham spoke of the Founding Fathers,
religion and character, which he called ``that which governs you
when no one else is watching.''
   Mecham once was the junior class president at Altamont High,
where he graduated 46 years ago.
   ``Forty-six years go faster than you think, you'd better watch
how you spend it,'' he advised the 48 graduating students.
   After the speech on the school's football field, the graduates
in red-and-white gowns and roughly 600 spectators gave Mecham a
standing ovation.
   Mecham, 64, became the seventh U.S. governor to be removed from
office in an impeachment trial when he was convicted April 4 by the
Arizona Senate for obstructing justice and misusing state funds.
   The Senate did not debate a third charge, that Mecham concealed
a $350,000 campaign loan on his financial disclosure forms, but the
former governor and his brother Willard will go on trial next week
in Phoenix on fraud and perjury charges. The jury in that case was
sworn in Friday.

   Fire raced through a refugee camp on
the outskirts of Dhaka on Saturday and injured at least 80 people
and left 17,000 homeless, police and fire officials said.
   A police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
blaze wiped out most of the shanties in the camp at Mirpour, north
of the city. The fire was believed caused by an electrical
short-circuit.
   The camp housed Biharis awaiting resettlement in Pakistan. The
Biharis, who are Moslems, originated in India but settled in the
territory once known as East Pakistan. The territory became
Bangladesh in 1971, after a war with Pakistan.
   Thousands of Biharis have been resettled in Pakistan, but nearly
250,000 remain in Bangladesh awaiting transfer. The resettlement
program has been suspended for lack of funds.
   Nasim Khan, a leader of the Biharis, complained that there are
often fires at the refugee camps because of poor construction.
   ``Our repeated requests to the concerned authorities to do
something about it have produced no results,'' Khan said. He
estimated it would cost $3 million to rebuild the camp and replace
the families' lost goods.
   There was no word on the conditions of those injured.

   Prospects for progress at the Moscow
summit on nuclear arms control dimmed today as President Reagan
prepared for his talks with General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Two senior U.S. officials said a prospective
``confidence-building'' measure due to be approved in Moscow next
week had fallen through.
   They also told reporters that two other arms control measures
may not be completed during Reagan's talks with Gorbachev.
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway said the Soviets
had turned down a U.S. proposal for pre-notification of missile
test launches.
   And Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the president's national security
adviser, said two agreements on monitoring underground nuclear test
explosions were not likely to be ready for Reagan and Gorbachev to
approve.
   The first deals with trying out U.S. and Soviet measuring
devices at test explosions in July and August.The joint experiments
in Nevada and at Semipalatinsk apparently will proceed in July and
August.
   But Powell said that ``a few technical issues have to be
resolved.'' The second protocol deals with so-called peaceful test
explosions. Powell said negotiators were having difficulty
reconciling the Russian and English versions.
   The explosions were limited to 150 kilotons in 1974 and 1976
treaties. Reagan has said he would submit them to the Senate for
ratification if verification measures were improved. It was not
clear if the setback in summit plans would affect his plan.
   Mrs. Ridgway, meanwhile, did not explain why the tentative
agreement to notify each other before missiles test launchings had
fallen through.
   She indicated the Soviets wanted a more sweeping
``confidence-building'' measure that was unacceptable to the United
States.
   Reagan spent more than two hours today in separate meetings with
Powell and Secretary of State George P. Shultz as he prepared for
Sunday's opening of the summit, and said of Reagan: ``He's upbeat.''
   Reagan, in a pre-recorded radio speech, hailed improvements in
human rights in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   But, he said, ``the basic structure of the system has not
changed,'' And, he said, ``there remain significant violations of
human rights and freedoms.''
   The speech was Reagan's weekly Saturday radio broadcast.
   In a telecast to the Soviet Union, he appealed for more openness
and religious freedom, while praising Gorbachev as a break with the
past.
   ``I have to say I think there is a difference between this
general secretary and other of your leaders that I had met with in
the past,'' Reagan said.
   The interview was recorded before Reagan left Washington. He
will open talks in Moscow with Gorbachev on Sunday.
   Stressing the human rights issue, Reagan noted that Gorbachev
had lessened some of the restrictions on the Russian Orthodox
church.
   ``I`ve just wondered if there isn't a field there in your own
country for more openness and the allowing of people to practice
religion in the ways they choose,'' Reagan said.
   An ardent anti-communist throughout his political career, Reagan
said none of Gorbachev's predecessors had an dreams of
restructuring the economy _ the program known as ``perestroika.''
   ``I felt that we had to exist in the world together,'' he said.
``Our systems are different. We're going to be competitive in a
number of ways, and that will continue. But we can be competitive
without being hostile to the point of conflict with each other.''
   Reagan on Friday invited jubilant Senate leaders to join him and
Gorbachev at the Moscow summit to celebrate final ratification of a
treaty banishing medium-range nuclear missiles from European soil.
   The treaty, approved 93-5 by the Senate on Friday after weeks of
heated debate, represents the only brake on the arms race that
Reagan has been able to achieve during his two-term presidency, and
he seemed eager to make the most of it.
   In Moscow, the collective Soviet presidency today unanimously
ratified the treaty.
   A session of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a 36-member
body headed by President Andrei A. Gromyko, met in special session
and cast a traditional unanimous vote in favor of the pact.
   Reagan said he was ``very pleased'' by the overwhelming Senate
vote, which enables him to enter next week's summit talks carrying
clear evidence of broad bipartisan support back home for his arms
control policies.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker, who stayed behind to
await the Senate vote, was flying to Helsinki late today to place
the treaty documents in Reagan's hands before he leaves for Moscow
on Sunday.
   At the president's request, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., and Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., are to fly to the
Soviet capital on Tuesday to witness Reagan's exchange of
ratification documents with Gorbachev the following day.
   ``We're just delighted that we're going to send you a treaty and
it was almost a unanimous vote,'' Byrd told Reagan by telephone
moments after the Senate vote.
   ``We are very pleased to be able to give you this in advance of
your stepping on Soviet territory in Moscow,'' Dole said.
   The treaty, which Reagan and Gorbachev signed at their
Washington summit last December, required some last-minute
negotiations with the Soviets to tighten compliance procedures. It
also survived determined opposition from a small band of
conservative Republicans led by Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina.
   In the meantime, the president retreated into seclusion again.
The only major interruption in his pre-summit rest stop since his
arrival early Thursday morning was a major foreign policy speech to
a Finnish audience on Friday.
   White House aides kept reporters, photographers and the
television cameras away from the president otherwise. Marlin
Fitzwater, the presidential spokesman, denied a report that Reagan
seemed to be limping slightly when he stepped from a limousine to
call on Finnish President Mauno Koivisto.
   In the speech, delivered in the same hall where the 1975
Helsinki agreement on human rights was signed, Reagan urged the
Soviets to accelerate the pace of reform.
   Some of the measures taken by Gorbachev in his three years at
the Kremlin helm are ``new and good,'' Reagan said, but the Soviets
still fall short of meeting international standards on human rights
and freedom.
   Ironically, Reagan called Moscow to task over a pact which he
had opposed in 1975.
   Political conservatives like Reagan saw the 35-nation agreement
as accepting the post-World War II borders of Eastern Europe and
thereby approving Soviet hegemony in the region.
   However, the pact sought to ease East-West tensions by promoting
a freer exchange of people and ideas. It has since served as a
handy weapon for critics of Moscow.
   ``Soviet practice does not _ or does not yet _ measure up to
Soviet commitment,'' Reagan said.

   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev,
allied perhaps only in the desire to help their husbands succeed at
the Moscow summit, are expected to suppress their much-touted
rivalry in the interest of a smooth session.
   But gossip-hungry summit watchers will be alert for any hint of
a new round in the purported superpower catfight, be it an archly
raised eyebrow from Mrs. Reagan or an extended lecture to the U.S.
press corps from Mrs. Gorbachev.
   The two women have scheduled their first get-together for Sunday
afternoon, as President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev face off
for the first time over a Kremlin negotiating table.
   Soviet experts predict the two women will strive to put aside
their differences and display goodwill at a summit that may prove
to be more show than substance.
   ``I suspect ... they both want to make sure that they don't get
in the way and that they don't become part of the story in a
negative sense,'' said Ed Hewett, a specialist in Soviet studies
and a senior analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   Even though both women pooh-poohed the idea they engaged in any
form of competition at last December's summit, former White House
chief of staff Donald Regan offered a behind-the-scenes peek at
their relationship in his book, ``For the Record.''
   Regan writes that Mrs. Reagan was peeved at the front-page
attention garnered by Mrs. Gorbachev's outspoken and fashionable
style during the first U.S.-Soviet summit in Geneva in 1985.
   Irritated by Mrs. Gorbachev's extensive conversation at their
first dinner, Mrs. Reagan sniffed afterwards, ``Who does that dame
think she is?'' Regan wrote.
   The former chief of staff also disclosed Mrs. Reagan's
predeliction for star-gazing in his book, a subject that Mrs.
Reagan so far has not addressed or been questioned about and one
that could dominate her early encounters with the media here.
   Mrs. Reagan is described privately by associates and White House
aides as determined to try to squelch reports of any renewed
disputes with Gorbachev's wife during this meeting.
   Mrs. Reagan ``has always been a gracious hostess and has always
been a courteous guest,'' said Shiela Tate, Mrs. Reagan's former
press secretary. ``You'll see that she will be this time, too.''
   Ms. Tate, a public relations executive with Hill & Knowlton,
said the first lady has always seen her role as an extension of the
diplomatic process.
   ``She cares a lot about how she represents this country and so
she'll do her best,'' said Ms. Tate.
   It turns out the two women will be spending a good deal of time
together in Moscow.
   Besides the visit to the Kremlin Cathedral of the Assumption,
they are also scheduled to tour the Tretyakov art gallery later in
the week.
   The president and Mrs. Reagan will see their counterparts at the
welcoming and departure ceremonies, as well as the Kremlin state
dinner and the U.S. reciprocal dinner held at the ambassador's
residence, Spaso House.
   The most lengthy and private encounter between the couples will
come after they attend a performance of the Bolshoi Ballet _ the
Gorbachevs have invited them to dinner at a private country house,
or dacha, outside the city.
   But it is unclear whether reporters will have as much access to
the two women as in the December summit, when journalists were able
to pepper them with questions during a nearly hour-long tour of the
White House.
   Though the American couple is staying only five days in the
Soviet capital, Mrs. Reagan plans to spend an entire day in
Leningrad, an hour's flight away.
   Whether that trip was planned without Mrs. Gorbachev's to
alleviate some possible friction at this summit, neither the White
House nor Soviet officials will say. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Saturday that Mrs. Gorbachev had made a last-minute
request that the wife of Soviet President Andrei Gromyko accompany
the U.S. first lady to Leningrad.
   Ms. Tate said she believes Mrs. Reagan is well aware that it has
been more than a dozen years since a U.S. first lady and president
visited Soviet soil and is therefore intent on making a good
impression with the Soviet people.
   ``I've always said, while her husband represents the head of the
country, she represents the heart,'' Ms. Tate said.
   A senior U.S. official analyst who who spoke on condition he not
be named, said the one-up-manship that occurs when the two women
meet ``isn't suprising.''
   ``The personal chemistry between the two women isn't good,'' he
said, adding, ``I guess that's because they're much alike _ they
are both strong women.''
   Hewett said that compared to Soviet wives in the past, ``Raisa's
role has been a remarkable one,'' and that the couple has been
attempting to show their nation ``it's time to enter the 20th
Century.''
   But he noted that Mrs. Gorbachev has been the target of internal
Soviet criticism for her high public stance and he predicted she
will tone down the assertiveness she displayed in Washington.
   ``Gorbachev wants the (Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces)
treaty, and other than that he wants an amiacable atmosphere at the
summit to show that he is in charge,'' Hewett said, adding that the
first ladies can contribute to that notion.
   On her own, Mrs. Reagan is scheduled to visit a Soviet
elementary school in Moscow, where she's expected to try out the
few Russian phrases she's been learning.
   Apparently stung by reports that she was not prepared for Mrs.
Gorbachev's forceful style and extensive knowledge of U.S. history,
art and political theory, Mrs. Reagan embarked on her own course of
study.
   The first lady has read several books on Soviet history,
culture, art and the Russian revolution, said her spokeswoman
Elaine Crispen.
   She has also viewed several videos on the country, including one
produced by Turner Broadcasting System and a series on the country
for ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' reported by the couple's son,
Ron.

<HEAD>Freed French Hostage Describes Wine Vow Made To God</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former hostage Jean-Paul Kauffmann, a
French journalist and wine expert, has sworn off wine until August
to keep a vow he made while a captive of Shiite Moslem extremists
in Lebanon.
   But friends have a cellarful of Bordeaux awaiting the countdown
three months from the date of his May 4 release.
   Kauffmann, 44, editor-in-chief of the quarterly wine magazine
L'amateur de Bordeaux, vowed to God during his three-year captivity
that if he were freed he would not drink wine for three months,
according to an interview in the June issue of Wine Spectator.
   Kauffmann's magazine is a quarterly devoted to the wines of
Bordeaux, where some of the world's finest vintages are grown.
   During Kauffmann's captivity, Jean-Michel Cazes, owner of
Chateau Lynch Bages, put away 200 bottles of top Bordeaux in a
special cellar as a gesture of support by the region's vintners.
   ``We're extremely happy to have him back,'' said Cazes. ``I'm
ready to turn it over to him whenever he wants it.''
   Kauffmann was abducted while on assignment for a French news
weekly.
   ``One day when I reached bottom, I made a vow not to drink for
three months following my liberation,'' Kauffman said, explaining
that during his detention he read the Bible and became religious.
   He decided to sacrifice something important in hopes that his
prayers for freedom would be answered, the magazine said.
   Kauffman was held by the same Shiite Moslem extremists who are
believed to be holding most of the 18 foreign hostages _ including
nine Americans _ remaining in Lebanon. The longest-held is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Kauffmann said his teetotaling captors _ Islam forbids alcohol _
thought he was a drunkard because they saw a picture of him at a
wine tasting.
   ``It was a tasting at Chateau d'Yquem. I had 15 glasses in front
of me. In their eyes that couldn't be anything but a scene of utter
drunkenness,'' he said.
   Kauffmann said he tried to explain that the taster sips wine and
spits it out.
   ``I don't believe I was able to convince the Islamic Jihad of
the subtleties of wine tasting,'' he added.

<HEAD>North Seeks Top-Secret Documents on Hostages, Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secrets about U.S. intelligence operations in
Iran and efforts to free Americans held hostage in Lebanon are
among the blizzard of classified documents demanded from the
government by Oliver L. North and his three Iran-Contra
co-defendants.
   Some of the documents sought in the defense's extensive
pre-trial discovery motion are so sensitive, independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh has said, that their courtroom disclosure would
jeopardize intelligence activities and could expose ``people in
very difficult situations to torture and death'' in the Middle East.
   District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell will have to rule on whether to
order Walsh to give the defense the documents sought in the 88-page
discovery motion. But the judge already has said the defense is
entitled to review any papers that are relevant to the defense.
   Already, more than 85,000 pages of classified material have been
turned over to the defense and an interagency task force is
reviewing another 200,000 pages bearing government secrets.
   It is apparent from the defense request that North, former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter, and arms dealers
Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord want documents they know are so
sensitive that agencies like the CIA and the National Security
Agency will fight hard to keep them secret.
   If the defense can convince Gesell that documents which the
government won't declassify are crucial for its case, the judge
might be forced to dismiss crucial portions of the indictment.
   Walsh has conceded that he must defer to Attorney General Edwin
Meese III on whether to disclose or withhold government secrets.
   Documents sought by the defense include material about U.S.
intelligence capabilities in Iran, and ``efforts to locate,
reserve, or obtain information on American citizens held hostage in
Lebanon or elsewhere.''
   The defendants want to inspect highly classified message traffic
between the United States and Israel _ as well as intelligence
intercepts _ regarding the transfer of American weapons by Israel
to Iran in 1985.
   Secret court orders allowing electronic surveillance of Iranian
officials who visited Washington in 1986 as part of the
arms-for-hostages negotiations are also sought.
   The defendants also want details about other covert operations
conducted by the U.S. government with the help of private citizens
and companies.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, and his
co-defendants are accused of conspiring to defraud the government
by diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   The discovery motion, initially filed under seal last week but
later released, signals that the defendants are trying to gather
proof that many of their actions were approved by other officials
in the Reagan administration.
   The defense wants notes of conversations with President Reagan
about the Iran-Contra affair taken by Vice President Bush,
Secretary of State George Shultz, former White House chief of staff
Donald Regan, Meese and other top officials in the government.
   It also seeks documents showing that other U.S. officials
``provided funding or logistical or other support'' for the Contras
during the ban on U.S. military aid imposed by Congress.
   The defendants requested documents ``indicating or tending to
establish authorization, approval, knowledge, or awareness, by any
officer, employee or agent of the United States, of the
`Enterprise' supply network as allegedly established by defendants
North and Secord to support military and paramilitary operations''
by the Contras.
   The defense motion said the documents sought are ``directly
material to pivital defense issues ... including each defendant's
knowledge, intent and motive, as well as to the authority of the
defendants to act for or on behalf or with the consent of the
United States government.''

<HEAD>Defense Minister Warns Against North Korea's Growing Military
Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Oh Ja-bok warned
Saturday that South Korea faces a heightened military threat from
North Korea following the communist North's deployment of new
Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles.
   Oh issued the warning on the longer-range missiles during an
emergency meeting of top military leaders to safeguard the Olympic
Games, which begin Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   ``The deployment of new missiles poses a serious threat to our
security,'' Oh said.
   The meeting was called after U.S. Army Gen. Louis C. Menetrey,
commander of the U.S. Forces in South Korea, testified before a
U.S. Senate subcommittee that North Korea has introduced SA-3 and
SA-5 missiles from the Soviet Union.
   The SA-5 surface-to-air missile especially poses a threat to
aerial operations by U.S. and South Korean air force jets because
it can cover the entire Korean peninsula, Menetrey said.
   Oh said North Korea can unleash a surprise attack on South Korea
``at any time'' by deploying 65 percent of its ground troops and 57
percent of its naval forces closer to the border separating the two
Koreas, divided since 1945.
   Oh said that North Korea has 41 percent of its air force jets
stationed south of the strategic line linking Pyongyang, the
capital, and its eastern port city of Wonsan.
   The forward deployment can cut the flying time of North Korean
jets to the border to ``a matter of few minutes,'' he said.
   Oh also said that North Korea is currently trying to create
``false tension'' inside the demilitarized zone in an apparent move
to hurt the Olympics.
   North Korea has charged South Korea with a number of alleged
armistice violations, including firing across the border and the
introduction of illegal weapons into the DMZ that separates the two
sides.
   South Korea has denied the charges.
   The South has in turn accused North Korea of resorting to
terrorist tactics to press its demands to serve as a co-host of the
Olympics. South Korea accused the North of bombing a Korean Air
jetliner that disappeared over Burma in November with 115 people
aboard.
   North Korea denied responsibility, but a woman who was a
passenger on an early part of the doomed flight confessed to
planting a bomb on the plane for North Korea to disrupt the
Olympics.
   As part of tightened security preceding the Games, a Cabinet
minister ordered police to maintain surveillance on foreigners
spending long periods of time in South Korea without a definite
purpose.
   Home Minister Lee Choon-koo, who is in charge of the nation's
135,000 police, issued the order Friday.
   The government has inaugurated a 13,000-member police Security
Task Force to guard Olympic athletes and facilities. Members were
selected for martial arts and foreign language skills.

   Afghan authorities today freed a French
photojournalist captured nine months ago and convicted of spying
after he entered Afghanistan with rebel fighters.
   Alain Guillo told a news conference in New Delhi after his
release: ``I would like to go back, if possible.''
   Asked if he would again go in with guerrillas, he said: ``That
doesn't really matter.''
   He was freed in Kabul, the Afghan capital, earlier in the day
after Gilbert Perol, secretary general of the French Foreign
Ministry, presented a letter from President Francois Mitterrand to
Afghan leader Najib.
   Guillo said he believed he was released because of the French
intervention and the summit beginning Sunday between President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   He said his imprisonment in Kabul was difficult.
   ``I wasn't treated too badly, but I was morally brutalized,'' he
said. ``For the first four months, I had no newspapers, books or
paper. I was always under surveillance and deprived of fundamental
rights.''
   Guillo, 45, arrived in New Delhi en route to Paris and reunion
with his family. He was to depart early Sunday on an Air France
flight.
   Guillo told the news conference at the home of French Ambassador
Andre Lewin that he had no advance warning of his release. Najib
announced his pardon Friday.
   He said he was captured Aug. 28 by Afghan security police after
he had entered Afghanistan from Pakistan with the rebels, who were
fighting Soviet and government troops.
   ``For 15 days, they hesitated between killing me on the spot and
arresting me formally,'' Guillo said of the Afghan police. ``They
would have blamed the killing on the Mujahedeen,'' he said,
referring to the rebels.
   Guillo was convicted Jan. 4 on charges of ``espionage and
subversive activities'' and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   He has denied he was spying.
   A French official in Kabul who spoke on condition of anonymity
said no conditions were attached to the release and no money was
paid. ``There was no agreement, no special considerations,'' he
said.
   Guillo arrived aboard an Aryana Afghan Airlines flight from
Kabul wearing a white shirt, gray trousers and black windbreaker.
He was clean-shaven and appeared relaxed.
   Embassy officials said Guillo would rest for several hours at
the ambassador's residence before resuming his trip to Paris aboard
an Air France flight.
   In Paris, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry welcomed
Guillo's release.
   ``This liberation brings to a happy conclusion contacts taken
with Afghan authorities to obtain the pardon of the French
journalist,'' the spokesman said.
   There was no immediate word on the fate of another imprisoned
Western journalist, Fausto Biloslavo, an Italian who worked for the
small Albatross News Agency.
   Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Fatah Weidi said today
he had no information on when or if the Italian would be released.
Earlier, Western diplomatic sources said they expected Biloslavo's
release soon.
   Biloslavo was captured in July 1987 after entering Afghanistan
from Pakistan with the guerrillas and also convicted of spying.
Guillo shared a cell with him.
   Anti-communist guerrillas have been fighting the Soviet-backed
regime in Kabul since 1978. Soviet troops entered Afghanistan a
year later to prop up the Afghan government but began withdrawing
earlier this month.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's collective presidency, in a
rare televised session, unanimously ratified the U.S.-Soviet treaty
banning medium-range nuclear missiles. A government spokesman
described the action as ``a very good prelude'' to President
Reagan's visit.
   Politburo member and Moscow Communist Party boss Lev N. Zaikov
said the summit beginning Sunday ``opens up new vistas'' in arms
control. ``The meeting inspires us with hope that even greater
agreements will be reached,'' he said in remarks to the Presidium
of the Supreme Soviet.
   The Presidium, a cabinet-like council headed by President Andrei
A. Gromyko, voted after more than an hour of speeches by members of
the ruling Politburo and other senior officials, including Defense
Minister Dmitri Yazov.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev sits on the 36-member
Presidium, but he appeared to be absent from the special meeting
that was televised nationally.
   The Soviet action followed by only 17 hours the U.S. Senate's
93-5 vote to ratify the pact signed by Reagan and Gorbachev at
their summit in Washington in December.
   Reagan arrives Sunday for five days of talks with Gorbachev, and
Soviet officials have been pressing for progress during the summit
toward an accord to cut strategic missile stockpiles in half.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov hailed the
ratification by both sides as ``a very good prelude to the summit
here in Moscow,'' and said the next step should be conclusion of a
strategic arms reduction treaty.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the treaty ``puts
the policy of `new thinking' into action'' and will allow diversion
of funds for use in the social sphere. ``New Thinking'' is
Gorbachev's term for his foreign policy program, which has also
been credited by the Soviets for improving relations between the
superpowers.
   Shevardnadze said the funds saved on weapons production would
add 300 million rubles ($508 million) to the budget this year alone
for non-military programs like environmental protection,
transportation improvements and other services.
   The foreign minister said the treaty was not the result of U.S.
pressure on the Soviet Union, but a mutually beneficial pact that
would advance stability.
   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev said the treaty could herald
the start of restructuring U.S.-Soviet relations, but ``there are
forces in the United States and Europe opposed to disarmament. It
was not without impact of these forces that the process of
ratification in the United States encountered certain
difficulties.''
   The Reagan administration had to fight off efforts by
conservative senators to add crippling amendments that would have
required reopening of negotiations on the pact.
   Yazov, who was named defense minister a year ago, said ``we
don't have any doubt that without this treaty the Americans would
have continued to deploy Pershings... We would have had to take
corresponding steps, and the spiral of the arms race would have
gone on and on.''
   Genrikh Borovik, head of the Soviet Peace Committee, said at a
press conference earlier Saturday that U.S. ratification was
``gratifying'' because it came without crippling amendments
proposed by Senate conservatives.
   Reagan commented in Helsinki, Finland, where he spent four days
prior to his Moscow visit, that he was ``very pleased'' by the
Senate's approval.
   The treaty requires both sides to scrap their nuclear missiles
capable of reaching distances of 300 to 3,400 miles. The Soviet
Union has 1,752 rockets of that range and the United States has 867.
   The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty _ known as INF _
was signed by Reagan and Gorbachev on Dec. 8, and contains the most
stringent verification procedures in arms control history.
   Reagan and Gorbachev plan to exchange the final texts of the
treaty as ratified by each side at a ceremony Wednesday.

<HEAD>History of Vice Presidential Choices Looks to Shape Party Picks in
'88</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush isn't likely to forget that night
in July 1980, when his hopes of being the Republican vice
presidential nominee were dashed and then suddenly restored. It was
a night certain to have a profound impact on how Bush goes about
filling the No. 2 spot on the 1988 GOP ticket.
   Michael Dukakis was only an observer of the long process that
led Walter F. Mondale to the historic decision to fill out the 1984
Democratic ticket with a woman. But the impression that process
created and the impact of disclosures about the dealings of
Geraldine Ferraro's husband are equally certain to affect how
Dukakis chooses a running mate.
   The selection of a running mate is often described as the most
important decision a presidential nominee makes.
   And Dukakis has followed tradition by declaring that his choice
will be dictated by the need to have someone qualified to serve as
president if ``heaven forbid'' something should happen to him.
   Thirteen vice presidents eventually moved to the top office _
eight of them upon the death of the president. Four others were
later elected president, though only one, Martin Van Buren, was
elected while serving as vice president. One vice president, Gerald
R. Ford, gained the presidency when the incumbent, Richard M.
Nixon, was forced to resign.
   Despite the fact that nearly one-third of presidents first
served as vice president, the No. 2 spot on the ticket historically
has gone to someone chosen at the last possible moment for reasons
based far more on politics than qualifications.
   According to Robert F. Kennedy, Texas Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson was
an accidental choice to be John F. Kennedy's running mate in 1960.
   The new book, ``Robert Kennedy, His Own Words,'' quotes Kennedy
as saying that when his brother offered the vice presidential
nomination to Johnson ``he never dreamt there was a chance in the
world he would accept it.''
   After Johnson accepted the offer, Robert Kennedy quoted his
brother as asking, ``Now what do we do?''
   The brothers tried to convince Johnson that putting him on the
ticket would provoke a liberal revolt on the convention floor. But
Johnson said he was willing to risk such a fight.
   As it turned out, Johnson's presence on the ticket was a
critical factor in helping Kennedy carry Southern states,
particularly Texas, in his narrow victory over Nixon.
   Harry Truman was little known outside his home state of Missouri
when he was tapped by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944.
   Roosevelt cared little about the vice presidential nominee as he
prepared to run for a fourth term although he decided well in
advance of the Democratic convention to dump Henry A. Wallace, who
had served four years as vice president and wanted another four.
But Southerners opposed Wallace and he was not well-liked in the
Senate.
   With World War II moving to a close, Roosevelt was looking ahead
to the possibility of Senate fights over peace treaties and
establishment of the United Nations. Truman was popular with his
Senate colleagues.
   In his memoirs, Truman recalled that when he arrived in Chicago
for the convention he brushed aside suggestions that he seek the
vice presidency.
   But Truman's old friend from Missouri, Robert Hannegan, was
Democratic Party chairman, and he was lobbying to get the senator
on the ticket.
   Truman resisted when party leaders asked him to allow his name
to be put forth to the convention as vice president.
   Then came a telephone call from Roosevelt. Hannegan held the
phone away from his ear and Truman could hear the president say,
``Bob, have you got that fellow lined up yet?''
   ``No, he's the contrariest Missouri mule I've ever dealt with,''
replied Hannegan.
   ``Well you tell him if he wants to break up the Democratic Party
in the middle of a war, that's his responsibility,'' said
Roosevelt, who then hung up.
   ``I'll have to say yes,'' Truman told Hannegan.
   Eighty-three days after taking office as vice president, Truman
succeeded to the presidency.
   Ford was the first vice president to attain that office under
the more deliberative process of the 25th Amendment. Then, after he
succeeded Nixon, Ford named Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York
as his vice president. Rockefeller won out over a little-known
Texan named George Bush.
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter settled on Minnesota Sen. Mondale after a
process in which prospective choices trooped to Plains, Ga., to be
interviewed by Carter.
   Eight years later, Mondale used a similar process. The people
who traveled to North Oaks, Minn., included three women, a black, a
Hispanic, and a white Southern senator.
   When Ferraro, a congresswoman from New York, was selected,
feminists were ecstatic. But the benefits Mondale reaped from the
bold choice of a woman quickly faded when the following weeks
brought headlines with accounts of her husband's business dealings.
   Bush was caught in one of the strangest sequences ever at a
nominating convention.
   The scene was Joe Louis Arena in Detroit on the night of July
16. For days Republicans had talked of a ``dream ticket'' made up
of Reagan and Ford. The former president would technically be vice
president but would actually assume far greater responsibilities,
becoming in effect a co-president.
   As the convention got under way that Wednesday night, Bush was
waiting to deliver a unity speech before the balloting to nominate
Reagan.
   He recalled waiting in the wings ``when a backstage worker came
by, patted me on the back, and said, `I'm sorry, Mr. Bush, really
sorry. I was pulling for you.'
   ```Sorry about what?' I asked, as we shook hands.
   ```You mean you haven't heard? It's all over. Reagan's picked
Ford as his running mate.'''
   Bush was described as furious as he left the hall, angry that
the Reagan people had not told him of the decision to choose
someone else.
   But the Ford option was looking less attractive. Among
considerations that disturbed Reagan advisers was the fact that
during the campaign, Ford would be addressed as ``Mr. President,''
while Reagan would be referred to as ``governor.''
   Then Ford appeared on television being interviewed by Walter
Cronkite. He said that he would not go to Washington as ``a
figurehead vice president.''
   Reagan was stunned to see the former president talking on
national television about their private discussions. The
impossibility of the projected arrangement was growing clearer.
   A call went out to Bush.
   ``It came out of the clear blue sky,'' he said. The ticket was
forged.

<BYLINE>Reagan Espouses Anti-protectionism But Erects Trade Barriers^
^By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although he has often railed against
protectionist trade legislation, President Reagan has erected more
anti-consumer trade barriers than any president since Herbert
Hoover, says a former top Reagan economic adviser.
   William Niskanen, a former member of Reagan's Council of
Economic Advisers, said that time after time the administration has
bowed to industry pressure to block imports.
   In one industry alone, autos, Niskanen estimated that the
administration's policies ended up costing American consumers $1.1
billion annually in higher car costs. He said that worked out to
$240,000 for each job saved in the domestic auto industry.
   ``The consistent goal of the president was free trade, both in
the United States and abroad,'' Niskanen writes in a new book. ``In
response to domestic political pressure, however, the
administration has imposed more new restraints on trade than any
administration since Hoover.''
   Niskanen's book, entitled ``Reaganomics: An Insider's Account of
the Policies and the People,'' is the latest published work by
former top administration officials depicting behind-the-scenes
White House struggles over policy.
   Like former budget director David Stockman and former White
House chief of staff and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan,
Niskanen paints a picture of a remote president who rarely
understood the intricacies of the subjects being heatedly debated
by his advisers.
   ``At Cabinet meetings he was visibly uncomfortable on being
presented with a complex argument,'' Niskanen writes. ``He was
impatient to hear conclusions.''
   In a criticism that could be leveled about the current
presidential campaign, Niskanen said that candidate Reagan in 1980
and 1984 resisted telling voters the hard choices that would be
needed to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   ``At no time during the 1980 and 1984 campaigns did Reagan
acknowledge that a substantial reduction in domestic programs was
necessary to permit both a defense buildup and a tax rate cut
without an increase in the deficit,'' he said.
   Likewise in the trade area, Niskanen said that Reagan found
himself constrained by promises he made on the campaign trail, in
particular a pledge to Chrysler workers in the fall of 1980 that
``one way or another'' Japanese car imports to the United States
would be reduced.
   The way found by the administration was to pressure the Japanese
to put into place voluntary constraints on car imports. The
administration kept up pressure on the Japanese to maintain the
import quotas even after the auto industry was enjoying record
profits and bestowing huge bonuses on its executives because it was
in the midst of the 1984 presidential campaign, Niskanen said.
   Politics also played a part in an administration decision in
October 1986 that imported softwood lumber from Canada was being
unfairly subsidized by the Canadian government. Niskanen said that
``determination was clearly timed to save several Republican Senate
seats in the timber-producing states.''
   Trade is an issue in the 1988 campaign as well with Democrats
hoping to get political mileage out of Reagan's veto last Tuesday
of a trade bill which contained a labor-backed proposal requiring
advance notification of plant closings and layoffs.
   While sharply criticizing Congress for protectionist bills,
Reagan has granted import relief to such industries as autos,
steel, machine tools, textiles and apparel, Niskanen said.
   ``A cynic might conclude that the administration wanted to
maintain control of the distribution of protectionist favors and
opposed only those trade constraints proposed by Congress,''
Niskanen said.
   A former chief economist at Ford Motor Co., Niskanen joined the
three-member Council of Economic Advisers in 1981 as a conservative
committed to Reagan's agenda of trimming back the federal
government. Niskanen left the administration in 1985 and is now
chairman of the Cato Institute, a conservative Washington think
tank.
   Niskanen gives Reagan credit for delivering at least partially
on his campaign promises to lower the growth of government
spending, reduce tax rates and lower inflation. But he concludes
that there ``was no Reagan revolution.''
   He blamed the failure of Reagan to make more substantial
progress in reducing the growth of government on the fact that ``as
candidate and president, Reagan endorsed the major surviving
programs of the New Deal.''
   ``The primary reason why Reaganomics did not prove to be a
revolution is that there has not yet been a fundamental change in
the perception about what the federal government should and should
not do,'' Niskanen said.
   Niskanen said the next president should strive to get spending
cuts in the programs which grew most rapidly during the Reagan
years, agriculture, defense and medical care.
   He said that increased taxes would be needed as well, but that
the hikes should not come from raising tax rates but rather by
going further in eliminating tax deductions, a trend which was
started by the 1986 tax overhaul legislation.
   Niskanen said there was no valid reason for maintaining
deductions for state and local income taxes and property taxes. He
also proposed taxing fringe benefits employees receive and reducing
the personal exemption to $300 instead of $2,000.

<HEAD>Stark Outlines New Medicare Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the Democratic Party's
weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday by Rep. Fortney H.
Stark of California:
   Hello, I'm Congressman Pete Stark of Oakland, Calif. I chair the
health subcommitteee of the Ways and Means Committee, which
oversees the Medicare system in the United States. And this week,
Congress agreed to the first major expansion of Medicare benefits
in over 20 years.
   Before I explain that landmark legislation, let me give credit
where credit is due. It was President Reagan who, a year ago last
February, suggested in his State of the Union message that it was
necessary to enact this legislation.
   His secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Otis Bowen,
picked up the challenge and presented Congress with an outline of a
plan which Republican Congressman Bill Gradison of Cincinnati, Ohio
and I took and formed into the Stark-Gradison Bill of the
Catastrophic Health Bill which passed the conference committee last
week.
   What did all this do? Well, let me tell my mom, because I want
to put it in terms she'll understand, and then maybe you'll all
understand.
   Mom, you've got Medicare now, and under the hospital, or Part A,
benefits, it's pretty confusing. You have to pay the first day's
hospital bill of $540. Then you get the first 60 days care, then
from 60 to 90 days you've got to pay $135 a day. Then from 90 to
150 days _ you get a lifetime exemption of those 60 days _ you've
got to pay $270, and after that you have to pay the whole bill. You
could pay $20,000 or even thousands more than that out of your own
pocket.
   Under our bill, you just pay once in a year the $540 for your
first day in the hospital, and Medicare pays the rest. Simple? You
bet.
   As to doctor's bills, you have to pay the first $75 and then you
have to pay 20 percent of every bill that doctor sends you. You
could pay thousands in a year. Under our bill, you still pay the
$75, and then you must pay $1,440 out of your pocket, but after
your $1,440 out-of-pocket, Medicare pays the rest.
   Now, you've got to remember, you go to a doctor who takes
assignment or participates, so that you're not charged more than
the Medicare approved rate.
   And there's a new benefit. A drug benefit. You have prescription
drugs in a year and previously you've received no help. After
you've spent $600 on precription drugs in one year under our bill,
the government will pay 80 percent of everything over $600 when the
bill is fully implemented.
   There's a new benefit that might help me if I were caring for
you someday _ in your home. It's called respite care. And the bill
will provide 80 hours of professional home care for you so that I
or my brother or anyone else who might be taking care of you could
get a day off or have a vacation with their family. We think that's
a wonderful added benefit.
   A special benefit ffor you, Mom, is the new mammography benefit
which allows you to have a mammographic examination every other
year, and you should do it. It's the first time we've added real
preventive care benefits to Medicare.
   And for those couples who are together and one of them has to go
to a nursing home under the Medicaid program, we've protected the
other, or surviving, or healthy spouse from impoverishment. We've
allowed them to keep some assets and a minimum income so that they
don't have to spend their entire assets and income for one spouse
leaving the healthy spouse destitute. We think that's a big help.
   But I know you're saying, Mom, ``Gee, Pete, you're a liberal
Democrat, and who's gonna pay for all this?'' Well, I'm happy to
say, Mom, you do. It won't cost the Treasury one penny. You're
going to pay $4 a month, and eventually it will go up to $10 a
month in a flat premium. If you became impoverished, Medicaid would
be required to pay the premium and your co-pay. So low-income
people will pay nothing.
   If you're around $75,000 a year, you'd have to pay as high as
$80 a month. But remember, you'd saved $25 to $50 a month in
Medigap policy premiums, so that you really, in general, would have
a super benefit. It's not long-term care, but it's a major
improvement in paying hospital, doctor and druggist bills.
   So drive safely this Memorial Day Weekend, and I hope your new
benefit makes you comfortable.

   Boy George or no Boy George, the blaring beat of
``heavy metal'' reverberated through the night as thousands of
Soviet teen-agers, many dressed in jeans and punk-style outfits,
sat mesmerized at a pre-summit rock concert under the open skies of
Gorky Park.
   They clapped politely at the end of each song and waved small
paper flags printed with a big heart divided by the Stars and
Stripes and the hammer and sickle.
   ``Gorky Park, Central Park, what's the difference?'' said
William Sloane Coffin, a veteran American peace activist who said
he saw little difference between the concert and similar
ear-splitting events in the United States.
   Except that in America, if the music is any good, there is more
pandemonium. The Soviet crowd was sedate by comparison. They
clapped politely at the end of each song and waved their small
flags. At one point as a pop group began its set, people screamed
briefly but immediately sat down.
   Sasha, a 24-year-old Soviet, said young people didn't dare act
out for fear of reprisals from the omnipresent law enforcement
authorities.
   ``If we danced, the cops would shackle our wrists,'' he said. He
did not want his surname used.
   Groups of stern-looking police officers were intermingled with
the audience, while men with German shepherd dogs stood in the back.
   Coffin, who delivered some remarks in Russian between rock
songs, wasn't supposed to be the chief draw from ``the West.'' He
was supposed to play second fiddle to the peculiar British rocker,
Boy George.
   Boy George never showed up, but the show went on, featuring
primarily Russian pop and ``heavy metal'' groups.
   The event was sponsored by the Soviet Peace Committee. A
spokeswoman for that group said Boy George ``just didn't come.''
She gave no further explanation.
   The concert was held in Gorky Park, a spacious area with acres
of green trees and gardens and one of the most popular outdoor
spots in Moscow. It was billed as part of an effort to promote
peace between the superpowers.
   About 18,000 young people listened to blaring rhythm from giant
amplifiers on both sides of the stage as bright colored lights
flashed overhead, even though Moscow stays light until about 11
p.m. in May. On stage, performers with spiked, dyed hair and
fluorescent outfits danced with their electric guitars.
   ``This is a festival put on for the Reagan visit,'' said Leni, a
young Russian woman.
   There was none of the frenzied behavior common at American
concerts, and no sign of beer, alcohol or drugs. A lone vendor sold
juice and bread outside the entrance.
   For a group of American students from Texas A&M, the concert was
a chance to see their Soviet counterparts and enjoy a balmy
evening. ``People have been very nice to us,'' said Laura Hauss,
21, of Austin, Texas.
   While the Soviets were eager to meet Americans and trade chewing
gum for popular lapel pins, they were a little cautious about their
actions.
   ``They are allowed to talk with us, but they are still
reserved,'' said Matthew Stellges of San Antonio, Texas. The Texas
students are spending four weeks studying Russian.

<TEXT>
   The quickest-selling item in Moscow Saturday may
have been the 20 Russian Bibles that went on sale _ briefly, at $50
each _ at a booth at the international press center set up for the
U.S.-Soviet summit.
   Vladimir, a 34-year-old engineer who asked that his surname not
be used, said it was the first time he had seen a Bible on sale in
Moscow, although he had read one while a university student. The
Bible, however, is not taught in school.
   ``I have never see a Bible in a store anywhere in my life,'' he
said. The bibles were printed by the Moscow patriarchy.
   The Bibles were gone within minutes after they were put on
display at a booth that also sold religious records. A crowd of
people surrounded the booth, pressing to get hold of the book.
   Each one sold for 35 rubles, about $50.
   Bibles are a rarity in the Soviet Union where the official
policy has discouraged religion. But Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev recently met with Russian Orthodox leaders to intensify a
dialogue between church and state.
   Bibles were confiscated by customs agents when people attempted
to bring them into the Soviet Union.

   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev are expected next week to sign an agreement that will
allow Americans for the first time to fish in Soviet waters.
   The agreement also would require joint efforts to conserve and
manage Bering Sea fisheries.
   ``We reached agreement in principle two days ago in Moscow,''
said Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans and
fisheries. ``It will be signed during the summit.''
   Wolfe declined to say when the signing was scheduled during the
Moscow summit, which begins Sunday. He spoke by telephone from his

   The 10-page pact is a final version of a tentative agreement

<HEAD>Reagan Removes Doubts Of U.S. Respect For Finnish Neutrality</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the broader issues of peace and
human rights, President Reagan's gesture toward non-aligned Finland
was lost.
   Except to the Finns.
   In a policy speech Friday in Helsinki, Reagan removed lingering
doubts about the U.S. regard for neutrality in Finland, the only
non-communist country in Europe to sign a friendship treaty with
the Soviet Union.
   Politicians and newspapers hailed Reagan's speech as a
long-awaited authoritative acknowledgement of Finland's status in
the no-man's-land of international politics.
   Reagan said: ``America respects Finland's neutrality. We support
Finland's independence. We honor Finland's courageous history. We
salute the creative statesmanship that has been Finland's gift to
world peace.''
   ``We are naturally very satisfied with Reagan's evaluation of
Finland and the achievement of its foreign policy,'' Mati
Kahiluoto, chief of the Foreign Ministry's political department,
told the Hufvudstadsbladet daily.
   The speech ``gave the best possible recognition to Finland's
neutrality without overdoing it with flattery,'' said Paavo
Lipponen of the Social Democrats, Finland's largest party.

   Jewish refuseniks are planning to demonstrate
daily during the Moscow summit to protest Soviet human rights
policy and the denials of their requests to leave the country.
   Many well-known Jewish activists have been allowed to emigrate
from the Soviet Union under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
leaving behind many others who have applied to leave.
   After Gorbachev came to power in March 1985, ``it seemed like
his reforms would solve the problem,'' said one of the activists,
Marina Durnovo.
   But lately the West has been paying less attention to the
problems of the activists, called refuseniks because they have been
refused permission to emigrate.
   Since the summit in Washington last December, ``the refusals
have been pounded down like hail,'' said Durnova.
   In planning to demonstrate during the summit, she said, ``our
aim is to draw the attention of the Soviet and American people to
the problem of Jewish emigration.''
   The U.S.-based National Conference on Soviet Jewry reported last
week that 1,086 Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet Union in
April, the highest monthly total in nearly seven years.
   The figure has been rising for about a year, but it falls far
short of the 1979 levels, when the monthly average was about 4,000
departures.
   Another activist, Yuri Semenovsky, said he had conducted a
survey of some of the estimated 2 million Jews in the Soviet Union
and concluded that 30 percent of them would like to leave. His
study appeared in the March issue of ``Referendum,'' an independent
journal published by the ``Press Club Glasnost,'' a dissident
organization that tests the limits of Gorbachev's reforms.
   Semenovsky said that 200,000 Jews had already applied to leave
the country and that many, like himself, had been harassed by the
authorities and forced out of their jobs and that many others were
afraid to ask.
   Members of the group disagreed on whether Gorbachev's reforms
had a positive overall effect. ``It is only cosmetic,'' said
Durnova.
   Semenovsky, in contrast, said that because of the reforms, ``the
barrier of fear had been lowered. People are not as afraid as they
were,'' he said, attributing the change to Gorbachev's policy of
greater openness.
   That same openness, however, has unleashed forces which some
Jewish activists view with fear. The ``Pamyat Society,'' a group of
ardent Russian nationalists who have become active under glasnost,
have voiced anti-Semitic sentiments, he said.
   Semenovsky's group has held 15 demonstrations this year, and
during the summit plans three more, all at the Lenin library in
downtown Moscow at 6 p.m. Some of the demonstrators have been
detained by police and fined for breaking the law, he said.
   No members of the group, which met with Western reporters on the
eve of President Reagan's arrival in Moscow on Sunday, were
scheduled to meet with the president during his stay.
   About a dozen Jewish activists were included in a group of
dissidents scheduled to meet with Reagan on Monday, the refuseniks
said.
   Among those expected to meet with Reagan were: Yuri and Tatyana
Zieman, Yuli Gosharovsky, Vladimir Kislik and his wife Bella Gulko,
Emil Lurie, Benjamen Charny, Igor Uspenski, his wife Ina Ioffe,
Roald Zelichenik, Yevgeny Linein and Emil Lurie, according to Yuri
Zieman and Semenovsky.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's
weekly radio address Saturday.
   The remarks were taped Monday in Washington.
   My fellow Americans, as this pre-taped broadcast reaches you,
I'm in Helsinki, Finland, on my way to the Soviet Union, where I
arrive on Sunday.
   When I meet in the coming days with Soviet General Secretary
Gorbachev, it will be our fourth set of face-to-face talks in three
years. Through our conversations, U.S.-Soviet relations have moved
forward on the basis of frankness and realism. This relationship
has not rested on any single issue, but has been built on a sturdy
four-part agenda that includes human rights, regional conflicts,
arms reduction, and bilateral exchanges.
   What has been achieved in this brief span of time offers great
hope for a brighter future and a safer world.
   Through Western firmness and resolve, we concluded the historic
INF Treaty that provides for the global elimination of an entire
class of U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Soviet armed forces are now withdrawing from Afghanistan, an
historic event that should lead finally to peace,
self-determination and healing for that long-suffering people, and
to an independent and undivided Afghan nation.
   It is also encouraging to hear General Secretary Gorbachev speak
forthrightly about ``glasnost'' and ``perestroika'' _ openness and
restructuring in the Soviet Union _ words that to Western ears have
a particularly welcome sound. And since he began his campaign, we
can list developments that the free world heartily applauds.
   We've seen many well-known prisoners of conscience released from
harsh labor camps or strict internal exile, courageous people like
Josif Begun and Andrei Sakharov.
   Soviet authorities have permitted the publication of books, like
``Dr. Zhivago,'' and the distribution of movies, such as
``Repentance,'' that are critical of aspects of the Soviet past and
present.
   Greater emigration has been allowed. Greater dissent is being
tolerated. And recently, General Secretary Gorbachev has promised
to grant a measure of religious freedom to the peoples of the
Soviet Union.
   All this is new and good. But at the same time, there's another
list that the West cannot ignore. While there are improvements, the
basic structure of the system has not changed in the Soviet Union
or in Eastern Europe, and there remains significant violations of
human rights and freedoms.
   In Asia, Africa, and Central America, unpopular regimes use
Soviet arms to oppress their own people and commit aggression
against neighboring states. These regional conflicts extract a
terrible toll of suffering and threaten to draw the United States
and the Soviet Union into direct confrontation.
   These and related concerns will be at the top of my agenda in
the days ahead. I shall say, among other things, that the Soviet
Union should fully honor the Helsinki Accords. In view of that
document, signed in Helsinki in 1975, it is difficult to understand
why almost 13 years later, cases of divided families and blocked
marriages should remain on the East-West agenda; or why Soviet
citizens who wish by right to emigrate should not be able to do so.
   And there are other issues: the recognition of those who wish to
practice their religious beliefs, and the release of all prisoners
of conscience.
   In working for a safer world and a brighter future for all
people, we know arms agreements alone will not make the world safer
_ we must also reduce the reasons for having arms. As I said to
General Secretary Gorbachev when we first met in 1985, we do not
mistrust each other because we're armed; we're armed because we
mistrust each other. History has taught us that it is not weapons
that cause war, but the nature and conduct of the governments that
wield the weapons.
   So when we encourage Soviet reforms, it is with the knowledge
that democracy not only guarantees human rights, but also helps
prevent war, and, in truth, is a form of arms control.
   So, really, our whole agenda has one purpose, to protect peace,
freedom, and life itself.
   We would like to see positive changes in the U.S.S.R.
institutionalized so that they'll become lasting features of Soviet
society. And I would like to see more Soviet young people come here
to experience and learn from our society.
   And that's why we're ready to work with the Soviets. To praise
and criticize, and work for greater contact, and for change.
Because that is the path to lasting peace, greater freedom, and a
safer world.
   I'm grateful for your prayers and support as I embark on this
journey. Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Dukakis: Biggest Tax Raiser And Tax Cutter In Massachusetts
History</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is the biggest tax raiser and tax
cutter in Massachusetts history, a dual distinction that puts him
in a curious position as a Democratic presidential candidate.
   The likely nominee can accurately lay claim to the tax-cutter
title. But Republican nominee-in-waiting George Bush can just as
correctly claim Dukakis is a tax-raiser.
   The Massachusetts governor talks frequently of cutting taxes
while mopping up Republican deficits, a pitch aimed at voters
worried about the federal deficit. But Dukakis is mindful of
Democratic nominee Walter Mondale's frank 1984 statement that he
would raise taxes if elected president, a promise that contributed
to his defeat.
   In 10 years as governor, Dukakis has for the most part been
reluctant to raise taxes, although he has done so to the tune of
$500 million, and equally reluctant to cut them, although he has
signed tax cuts totaling nearly $710 million.
   ``He's very, very gun-shy about tax hikes and rather leery about
tax reductions,'' said Richard Manley, executive director of the
Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.
   If elected president, Dukakis has said new taxes would be a last
resort. Bush has backed away from an early campaign promise not to
raise taxes and adopted a position similar to that of Dukakis,
seemingly making taxes a non-issue in the fall campaign.
   But Bush supporters are closely watching the Massachusetts
Legislature, where lawmakers are on the verge of sending a $110
million tax increase package to Dukakis' desk.
   ``They have just spent themselves into a fiscal mess,'' said
Barbara Anderson, executive director of Citizens for Limited
Taxation, an anti-tax lobby founded to oppose Dukakis' tax
policies. ``So, true to form, the first recourse is a tax
increase.''
   Dukakis became the biggest tax raiser in state history in 1975,
when in his first year as governor he broke a campaign promise not
to raise taxes.
   After months of refusing to break the pledge while the state's
fiscal crisis worsened, Dukakis relented and the Legislature
approved nearly $500 million in new taxes. They included increased
sales, cigarette, liquor and estate taxes and a 7.5 percent income
tax surcharge.
   ``Taxachusetts'' became the leading nickname for a state with a
struggling economy and an unemployment rate hovering near 12
percent.
   Richard Gephardt, the Missouri representative and former
Democratic candidate, tried to use those tax hikes against Dukakis
during the primary campaign. Bush aides say the vice president is
considering a similar attack.
   But at home, even Dukakis' enemies defend him on the 1975 tax
hikes, widely blamed for his defeat in 1978.
   Dukakis inherited a $530 million deficit from Republican Gov.
Francis Sargent and the state was in danger of defaulting on bond
issues.
   ``The alternative was to start managing the budget, but in all
fairness he didn't have time,'' said Anderson, the governor's
fiercest critic on tax and spending policy.
   While Dukakis was out of office from 1978-1982, there were minor
adjustments in the state's meal and gasoline taxes, and voters
approved a major property tax cap.
   Back in office in 1983, Dukakis, who opposed the property tax
cap, tried unsuccessfully to amend it so that city councils, not
voters, would have authority to override it.
   After losing that battle, Dukakis proposed business taxes
totaling up to $300 million to fund infrastructure projects, but
House leaders refused to support him.
   In 1984, a legislative election year, Dukakis vetoed a
four-year, $600 million tax cut package that would have increased
personal exemptions and halved taxes paid by senior citizens on
unearned income.
   At the time, the state had a surplus approaching $300 million
and its budget was growing by nearly $1 billion a year.
   But the booming economy and growing surplus sparked a tax-cut
drive Dukakis was powerless to stop.
   Anderson's group collected enough signatures to place before
voters an initiative to repeal the surtax and to impose a state tax
cap.
   Dukakis, who had consistently opposed repealing the surtax,
agreed to do so and also signed _ 12 days before the 1986 election
_ additional tax cuts increasing personal exemptions and raising
the maximum income for no-tax status. The governor, re-elected in a
landslide, opposed the tax cap referendum but it was narrowly
approved.
   ``We thought we had died and gone to heaven,'' said Anderson.
   To illustrate the change, consider the state tax burden. In
fiscal 1977, Massachusetts residents paid $177 in state and local
taxes and fees per $1,000 of income, 9 percent above the national
average of $162. In contrast, in fiscal 1986, the Massachusetts tax
and fee burden was $150 per $1,000 of income, 5.7 percent below the
national average of $159.
   Although Dukakis opposed the majority of the tax cuts, he now
touts them in campaign speeches and ads.
   Anderson and other critics are crying foul.
   ``In every instance he opposed cutting taxes until he was
carried kicking and screaming with his feet to the fire and forced
to do so,'' said Royall Switzler, a former House Republican leader.
``What he's saying now is all blue smoke and mirrors.''
   But others say Dukakis has been careful not to claim direct
responsibility for the tax cuts.
   ``He took the heat for the 1975 tax hike that wasn't his fault
so why shouldn't he take some credit for the tax cuts?'' said
Manley.
   ``He's a guy who has signed tax cuts and proposed tax
increases,'' said Martin Linsky, a Republican who served with
Dukakis in the Legslature in the 1960s and now teaches at Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   ``I think the line between putting the best face on things and
misrepresentation is not a line of science,'' Linsky said. ``It's a
line of art and that's what the campaign will be about.''

   Police arrested 35 people at an isolated
farmhouse and discovered indications of satanic ritual, along with
piles of money, an arms cache and a corpse bearing signs of
Mafia-style execution, newspapers said Saturday.
   ``We still don't know how much the Mafia and black magic were
involved in this affair,'' investigating magistrate Luigi Belvedere
was quoted as saying in the Paese Sera newspaper.
   The raid was ordered after a man showed up Wednesday night at a
hospital in this southern city. He was suffering from gunshot
wounds and said he had been involved in a bizarre religious ritual.
   Following the tip, police went to the farmhouse and found 35
young people holding hands and murmuring ``Hail Mary'' around a
table with a picture of the Virgin Mary and one of Antonio
Naccarato. On the floor lay a dismembered cat.
   Naccarato, who died in 1983, was a southern Italian who sought
work in the northern city of Turin and was regarded by some as a
saint and healer, newspapers reported.
   The worshipers reportedly took no notice of the police and would
only say: ``I am an apostle of Christ.''
   The police knocked down a metal door and found the corpse of a
27-year-old man who had been shot to death a few days earlier.
   Police said the victim was bound in a way that the 'Ndrangheta _
the Calabrian version of the Mafia _ reserves for traitors.
   The body was surrounded by 18 rifles, guns, knives, thousands of
bullets and nearly $800,000 in cash and checks.
   Lidia Naccarato, 36, the niece of Antonio Naccarato, was one of
those arrested. Police said she was found in a trance-like state in
a room adjacent to the ceremony and denied knowing anything about
the dead body.

   The leftist Sandinista government said
today it was willing to discuss some of the political reforms the
rebels are demanding as a condition for ending the 6{-year-old
civil war.
   Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Ortega, head of the government
delegation at peace talks, said the offer was put before the rebel
leaders as the two sides resumed their discussions for a third day.
   The government asked rebel leaders to stay on and continue the
talks through the weekend, but the rebel leaders refused and said
they had to leave by the end of the day.
   The Sandinista offer included, with some rewording, nine
proposals from the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras. These
included calls for political pluralism, equality before the law,
the right to strike and a pluralistic electoral system.
   The government offer reworked Contra demands for the separation
of state powers and the elimination of the state identification
with the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   The Sandinista negotiators also offered to discuss ``norms and
guarantees for the functioning of a system of mixed economy,
including the different forms of ownership.''
   All of this, Ortega said, would be discussed in a national
dialogue after a permanent cease-fire takes effect.
   Ortega said there had been ``considerable progress'' made during
the talks.
   ``We are going to the meeting hoping we can persuade them,''
Ortega told reporters.
   The negotiators were expected to agree on an extension of a
temporary cease-fire, paving the way for further peace talks at a
future meeting.
   Luis Rivas Leiva, a member of the Contra delegation, said there
were only five minor points to discuss in dealing with the
procedures for the truce extension and administration of areas
where the rebels have been gathered since the start of a two-month
cease-fire. That truce ends Monday.
   ``Then we can go on to discuss the more difficult aspects of the
political topics,'' he said.
   He said that would include the political conditions demanded by
the Contras for them to return to the ``political life of the
country'' and a permanent cease-fire.
   Contra leaders on Friday rejected a government proposal to
continue the latest round of peace talks past today's deadline and
said an agreement could be signed immediately if the leftist
government really wanted one.
   Meanwhile, one of the best-known commanders of the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels ended his struggle against the Sandinista government
and said he would encourage his troops to do the same.
   Felix Garcia Hernandez, known as Alfa Lima, told reporters
Friday that before he sought amnesty he commanded more than 400
Contra fighters in the central Chontales region of Nicaragua.
   Alfa Lima's action was the latest in a series of political
defeats suffered by the beleaguered guerrillas.
   Alfa Lima abandoned the rebel force with six of his men on
Wednesday. He said he hoped to encourage more of his former
comrades to take advantage of the amnesty.
   ``I am going to try to convince my men to come in. There are
many out there who do not know what they are doing or why they are
fighting,'' said the soft-spoken Alfa Lima, still wearing his
camouflage uniform.
   Alfa Lima's former commander-in-chief, Enrique Bermudez, in
Managua for the peace talks, said he regretted the officer's
decision.
   ``He was a field commander with a long record. We consider him a
war casualty,'' Bermudez said.

<TEXT>
   The National Safety Council may be best known for
its grim projections of highway death tolls on holiday weekends,
but its leaders wince at their perceived role as ``body counters.''
   The council's warnings about the risks of holiday travel are
just a small part of its public-education effort to save lives and
prevent accidents by making Americans more careful, said T.C.
Gilchrest, the organization's president.
   The mission is the same as when the council was founded 75 years
ago by representatives of industry, railroads and insurance
companies concerned about the loss of lives and production.
   ``We try to reduce what is unacceptable,'' Gilchrest said last
week of the public-service organization, a not-for-profit,
non-governmental group.
   And the council considers it unacceptable that in 1986 there
were more than 90,000 accidental deaths and 8.9 million disabling
injuries in the United States at a cost to the economy of about
$118 billion.
   ``No accident is a function of fate or providence,'' said
Gilchrest. ``Every accident is a function of carelessness that
could be prevented.''
   The council has 12,400 member organizations _ including
businesses, schools and private groups _ and works with about 100
affiliated local safety councils.
   Membership fees account for about 15 percent of its $29 million
annual budget, according to council Vice President Melinda Thomas.
Most of the balance is generated by safety-consulting services,
defensive driver courses and other instruction programs and
materials.
   Gilchrest said the council has changed with the times to go
beyond its traditional industrial and traffic safety concerns,
getting involved in such issues as AIDS prevention and drug abuse.
   But consumer advocate Ralph Nader said the council remains too
much under the influence of industry, avoiding critical studies on
workplace safety that might offend corporate members.
   ``The council spends a lot of time on human miscues, handling
machines, and not enough on badly designed consumer products and
workplace machinery that abuse consumers and workers,'' said Nader
in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C.
   Gilchrest said he takes pride in the council's reputation as
``an honest broker'' on safety issues. He said the council takes a
positive approach that puts greater emphasis on saving lives than
on ``finger pointing.''
   With workplace accidents costing U.S. industry about $34.8
billion in 1986, he said companies understand safety is better
business. The loss estimates are based on wage losses, medical
expenses, insurance costs, property damage, money value of time
lost on the job and other factors.
   The nation's accidental death rate has dropped 52 percent in the
past 75 years, from 82 per 100,000 population in 1912 to 39 per
100,000 in 1986, but rates are lower in Japan and many Western
European countries.
   ``In terms of safety, America is a third-rate country,'' said
James Tye, director general of the British Safety Council in London.
   Five years ago, when Gilchrest became president, the council
faced criticism from members who said it was not measuring up to
its 1953 charter from Congress designating it as the agency to lead
the fight against accidents, Gilchrest said.
   The council is taking stands on issues it might have ducked
previously, said Gilchrest.
   Last month, its representatives opposed raising the national
speed limit from 55 to 65 mph in testimony before a House
committee, saying the lower limit had saved about 90,000 lives
since 1973.
   The council also supports mandatory air bags in cars and smoking
bans on commercial airline flights.
   The council said it compiles its ``body counts'' to make people
more careful and to try to reduce the number of holiday traffic
deaths, which often are about 10 percent higher than fatalities
during a normal weekend.
   Before each holiday weekend, the council estimates traffic
deaths based on an analysis of traffic patterns, factoring in such
variables as actual recent death counts and legislation that could
have an impact on motorists' behavior.
   The council projects 380 to 480 people will die in traffic
accidents this weekend, as opposed to 390 who would be expected to
die in three days on a non-holiday weekend.

   For 43 years, Charles W. Lindberg has
looked at photos of himself and five other Marines raising an
American flag on Iwo Jima in the prelude to one of the most
celebrated moments of World War II.
   Lindberg was part of the first flag-raising on the tiny Japanese
island, an event few know about besides the men who were there.
   About four hours later, a second flag was hoisted on Mount
Suribachi. That moment was immortalized by Associated Press
photographer Joe Rosenthal in a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo.
   Lindberg wasn't part of THE photo, but he's not jealous of those
who were.
   ``I'd rather be in this one than I would the second. This is a
true picture,'' said Lindberg, pointing to himself in one of his
many photos of the first flag-raising. ``Ours is the genuine
thing.''
   Lindberg, 67, a retired electrician, lives with his wife,
Violet, in a Minneapolis suburb. He has a roomful of books, photos
and mementos of Iwo Jima.
   The Grand Forks, N.D., native enlisted in the Marines in January
1942 at age 21. Three years later, a corporal, Lindberg went to Iwo
Jima as a member of the 28th Regiment of the 5th Marine Division.
   Iwo Jima, only eight miles square, was a strategic piece of land
750 miles south of Tokyo, and the United States wanted it to
support long-range B-29 bombers and a possible invasion of Japan.
   On Feb. 19, 1945, 30,000 Marines landed on the southeast coast.
More than 6,800 U.S. servicemen died in the five-week battle that
followed, and the 21,000-man Japanese defense force was virtually
wiped out.
   Lindberg's squad was in the spearhead of the attack on
Suribachi, at 546 feet the highest point on the island. It wasn't
far from the beach where the Marines landed, but it took four days
to climb.
   Lindberg remembers the Feb. 23 flag-raising as if it were
yesterday.
   ``When we reached the top of that mountain, about 10:30 in the
morning, we thought we were going to be in a lot of trouble,''
Lindberg said.
   ``First thing was, get the flag up. A couple of guys found a
water pipe up there. They had water systems, I guess. We tied the
flag to that pole and we carried it to the tallest place we could
find and we raised it.''
   It was the first time an American flag had flown over Japanese
territory. Lou Lowery, a photographer for the Marine magazine,
Leatherneck, took pictures of the men raising the flag on a 20-foot
pole.
   ``That's when everything broke loose,'' he said. ``The troops
down below began to cheer, and ship whistles out in the bay began
to toot. I tell you, it just made you shiver all over. I don't know
if it was pride or patriotism or what it was. What a feeling that
was. I'll never forget that.
   ``But right away, boom! I think the Japanese started to come out
of the caves,'' Lindberg said. ``So then we had to go after them.
Right away.''
   Lt. Col. Chandler W. Johnson ordered another, larger flag.
Meanwhile, Rosenthal was climbing the mountain. In an interview
from his San Francisco home, Rosenthal, 76, remembered how he ran
into Lowery coming down.
   Lowery laughed and said, ``I already got pictures up there. You
guys are late.''
   Rosenthal kept going, and bullets were still flying when he
captured the prize-winning image of five Marines and a Navy medical
corpsman driving the new flag into the ground.
   ``His (Lowery's photo) was 10 times more arduous to get than
mine,'' Rosenthal said. ``There may be some question which of the
two of us is the better photographer. However, there can be no
doubt which of us is luckier.''
   Of the six Marines who raised the original flag, only Lindberg,
1st Lt. Harold Schrier and Pfc. James Michaels returned from the
bloody battle alive.
   Lindberg's war ended on March 1, when a bullet shattered his
right forearm.
   Sgt. Ernest Thomas, Sgt. Henry Hansen and Pfc. Louis Charlo died
on the island. Schrier died in the 1970s, Michaels two years ago,
and Lowery died last year, Lindberg said.
   That makes Lindberg the sole surviving member of the crew.
   ``I think it was quite a thing to be, what I did. But you never
do it alone,'' Lindberg said.

   With no chance of an agreement on strategic arms,
American officials are focusing on other issues they hope will make
President Reagan's trip to Moscow more than just a travelogue.
   When the Moscow summit _ the fourth between Reagan and Soviet
Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev _ was set late
last year, both sides were optimistic they could sign a treaty
reducing long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   But the negotiations are far from complete, snagged on
verification and the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, among other
things.
   Among the other issues to be discussed during the Moscow summit:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NUCLEAR TESTING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reagan and Gorbachev had been expected to sign two protocols in
Moscow dealing with underground nuclear explosions, but U.S.
officials on Saturday said the agreements may not be ready. Both
are designed to improve monitoring procedures.
   A U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in 1974 limits underground blasts,
the only nuclear explosions still legal, to 150 kilotons. At the
summit, the two leaders are likely to set the ground rules for
joint experiments in Nevada and in Semipalatinsk in July and August
to measure the force of detonations.
   The Americans prefer a system known as Cortex, which involves
inserting a cable in a shaft about 30 feet from the test and taking
measurements from it, while the Soviets like the seismic system
used for earthquakes.
   Both systems will be used at the U.S. and Soviet tests.
   A 1976 treaty set the same 150-kiloton ceiling for so-called
peaceful blasts. These are nuclear explosions to change the courses
of rivers, or for other non-military purposes. The United States
wants to be able to monitor blasts above the 50-kiloton level.
   Neither side now engages in such testing.
   Still, Reagan has said if verification measures to guard against
cheating are improved he would submit the unratified treaties to
the Senate for approval.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Top U.S. officials say the summit will give both sides an
opportunity to ``review where we are'' regarding conventional
weapons in Europe, but a bilateral accord is unlikely because of
on-going negotiations in Vienna between the countries of the Warsaw
Pact and NATO alliance. There have been hints that Gorbachev might
unilaterally withdraw 50,000 to 100,000 troops from Eastern Europe
to gain a public relations advantage in the negotiations.
   Moscow has conceded for the first time that it has an advantage
over the West in some military categories. The Pentagon estimates
the Soviets have 230 divisions in Eastern Europe compared to 121
for NATO.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHEMICAL WEAPONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Like conventional arms, the issue of chemical weapons is the
subject of multilateral treaty negotiations under way in Geneva.
Hence, the United States is reluctant to sign anything, although
the issue will be raised.
   The Soviets have been pressing the United States to endorse a
sweeping ban on lethal chemical weapons, but U.S. officials say
that push is politically motivated. What the United States wants is
a ``truly global chemical weapons agreement'' that can be verified,
Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway said.
   The Soviets have agreed to join the verification process, but
they haven't filed the necessary plans to safeguard against
cheating. U.S. officials estimate the Soviets have 300,000 tons of
chemical weapons, about six times the U.S. amount.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REGIONAL CONFLICTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The future of Afghanistan will be raised even though the Soviets
have agreed to withdraw from the country under a U.N. agreement
signed this spring. Specifically at issue is the fate of 5 million
refugees living in Pakistan and Iran.
   The top regional issue, however, is Angola where U.S. and Soviet
officials have been trying to arrange a withdrawal of 40,000 Cuban
troops from the country. Withdrawal would have to be accompanied by
implementation of U.S. resolution 435, calling for an end to the
South African occupation of Namibia.
   Otherwise, the United States wants the Soviets to stop selling
weapons to Iran in the Gulf War and to pressure Vietnam to remove
its troops from Cambodia.
   On the Mideast, the Soviets want a full-blown international
peace conference to reach a settlement, while the United States
favors a mostly ceremonial conference that would lead to bilateral
talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CULTURE, EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The two sides hope to arrive at a three-year agreement on
educational and cultural exchanges, extending the accord signed at
Geneva in November 1985. The exchanges, monitored by the U.S.
Information Agency, have mushroomed as Americans and Soviets seek
to learn more about each other through visits and study. But the
exchanges are still lopsided with many more Americans visiting the
Soviet Union than vice versa. Under the agreements, high school and
college students have traveled abroad, and entertainers from both
countries have toured.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HUMAN RIGHTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reagan can be expected to broach the human rights issue,
particularly the plight of thousands of Soviet Jews who have been
prohibited from emigrating. Meantime, both sides are moving toward
an agreement that would allow American psychiatrists to visit
Soviet mental hospitals to determine if dissidents are being
imprisoned in the hospitals. The Soviets would carry out reciprocal
visits to U.S. mental hospitals.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SCIENCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators have drawn up _ but may not sign _ a draft agreement
that calls for annual U.S.-Soviet meetings to promote freer
scientific data exchanges. It includes regulations to protect
scientific ideas, and gives the United States possible access to
Soviet research fields such as nuclear fusion, mathematical theory
and metallurgy.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SPACE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The United States has agreed to help a Soviet unmanned probe of
the planet Mars in 1994, but the two sides are far from signing an
agreement for a joint mission. The Reagan team, however, is
prepared to propose the exchange of studies of future space
projects.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FISHERIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Americans are excited about the possibility of a fisheries
agreement at the summit. At its heart would be the U.S. right to
fish in the Soviet economic zone, 200 miles from shore. Of
particular interest to the United States is the Bering Sea. Soviet
vessels already have access to the U.S. 200-mile zone. The
comprehensive agreement would also cover conservation and
environmental protections.

   Anthony Marino, a veteran journalist who rose
through the ranks during a 53-year career at the Daily News, has
died. He was 80.
   Marino died Friday at Cabrini Medical Center after a long
illness.
   Marino joined the News as a copyboy in 1926 and advanced to the
police beat three years later. He also worked as a general
assignment reporter and in 1962 was named assistant city editor. He
retired in 1979.
   ``He had the greatest patience in the world with young
reporters,'' said William Federici, a former News reporter. ``If he
thought a reporter had something in him, he brought it out.''
   Marino is survived by his wife, Kay Gardella, a television
critic at the News.

   Morocco is making so much headway
winning people over in this long-disputed territory that it no
longer fears a referendum on independence among the inhabitants.
   Exemption from taxes and import duties, development projects and
an apparently unlimited supply of fresh water _ most precious of
all commodities in the desert _ have helped undermine the support
once enjoyed by the Polisario independence movement.
   The hardest blow suffered by Polisario, which Algeria supports,
was the announcement May 17 that Algeria and Morocco had restored
diplomatic relations after 12 years of hovering on the brink of war
over the Sahara.
   Algeria had pledged not to renew relations until Morocco granted
independence to the territory.
   The Moroccan army took foreign reporters on a five-day tour of
the 110,000-square-mile wilderness, allowing them to set their own
itinerary and talk with inhabitants at random, without military
escort.
   Nomadic tribes of the former Spanish colony paid allegiance to
the sultans of Morocco for centuries, and Morocco annexed the
territory after Spain withdrew in 1975.
   Polisario, a Marxist-led movement that is armed, financed and
supplied by Algeria, began fighting from Algerian sanctuaries and
at one time virtually overran the Moroccan defenders.
   Its guerrillas have been unable to breach a 1,500-mile wall of
sand and rock that Morocco erected, but defending it has cost the
Moroccans nearly 10,000 men dead or wounded and an estimated $400
million a year, much of it donated by Saudi Arabia.
   Inhabitants of the region, estimated at 76,000 by the Spanish
colonial administration, have fled to the Moroccan-held cities or
to refugee camps around Tindouf, an Algerian oasis about 500 miles
south of Casablanca.
   The United Nations is trying to arrange a referendum among
original inhabitants and their offspring on whether they want
Moroccan rule or independence.
   King Hassan II proposed the referendum in 1981. Moroccan
officials say Polisario's increasing reluctance to accept a
U.N.-supervised referendum is a measure of the movement's loss of
support among the population.
   Reporters saw no sign of Polisario activity or support.
   Saharan workers in the Bou Craa phosphate mines, Saharan
fishermen in Dakhla port, 800 miles south of Casablanca,
shopkeepers in El Ayoun, the territorial capital, and nomads with
their herds of camels and goats all expressed pro-Moroccan feelings
and loyalty to Hassan.
   Pictures of the monarch were displayed in their tents. The king
is both political and religious leader of Morocco.
   Mohamed Ould M'barek, 65, has pitched his tent 25 miles west of
Bou Craa. He sold two-thirds of his 100 camels to buy two
apartments in El Ayoun for his two wives, so his children can go to
the new Moroccan-run schools there.
   Asked how he felt about Polisario, the gray-bearded Bedouin
clutched the engraved silver handle of his dagger and said angrily:
``If they come here, I will kill them.''
   In El Ayoun, trader Mohamed Khaddad said one of his eight sons
was with the Polisario in Tindouf. He said there had been no word
from him in eight years and declared:
   ``If he ever comes back, I will tell him he is a traitor to his
country and his king. I pray that God may give me the strength to
forgive him one day.''
   Salah Zemrag, governor of El Ayoun province, said Morocco has
built schools, hospitals, highways, artesian wells and more than
18,000 homes in the town, which was little more than a military
outpost when the Spanish left.
   Fadli Rguibi, 38, is among hundreds of former Polisario
guerrillas who Moroccan officials say fled across the desert from
Algeria in recent months as morale declined and camp conditions
worsened.
   Of the people in the Tindouf refugee camps, Rguibi said: ``They
are carefully watched and spied on. They are afraid to talk freely
among each other because anyone could be an informer. But you can't
suppress the truth forever. Everyone long suspected the war was
lost, only the leaders still seemed to believe in it.''
   Polisario originally claimed the Western Sahara had 1 million
inhabitants, most of them in and around Tindouf, but now says only
165,000 refugees live in the Algerian camps. Morocco says most are
not Saharans.
   Rguibi said the guerrillas number fewer than 10,000.
   In Aousserd, a desolate volcanic crater outpost 125 miles
southeast of Dakhla, the reporters were taken by helicopter to a
strongpoint on the wall.
   Moroccan soldiers manned French, American and Czechoslovak-made
artillery and machine guns overlooking the wide, empty plain
leading into neighboring Mauritania. The red, green-starred
Moroccan flag fluttered overhead.
   Gen. Abdelaziz Bennani, commander of Moroccan forces in the
Sahara, said the wall was manned by 80,000 men, more than half the
Moroccan army, equipped with sophisticated weapons and radar
sensors.
   ``Our equipment is so sensitive,'' he said, ``that we recently
picked out a truck with four tourists who lost their way in the
desert from more than 25 miles away.''
   He said the guerrillas last attacked the wall Jan. 30 in a
hit-and-run raid without causing Moroccan casualties or getting
near the Moroccan defenses.
   ``Their claims of almost daily attacks are sheer fantasy,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The special U.N. envoy for Afghan
refugees urged the United States and Soviet Union on Saturday to
help repair the destruction wrought in Afghanistan by a decade of
civil war.
   ``I extend an appeal to Reagan and Gorbachev that they come
together and give the United Nations multilateral means to restore
the country that has been virtually destroyed by 10 years of
warfare,'' Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan said on a one-day visit to the
Afghan capital.
   President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader,
begin a summit Sunday in Moscow. Sadruddin urged the leaders to use
the summit to support U.N. humanitarian programs in Afghanistan.
   Sadruddin said a successful humanitarian aid program could be
the key to peace in Afghanistan, where Moslem guerrillas began
fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978. Soviet soldiers, who
entered the country in December 1979, began withdrawing May 15
under an agreement mediated by the United Nations.
   The prince warned against a hasty return of more than 5 million
Afghan refugees who fled to neighboring Pakistan and Iran to escape
the war.
   ``It would be very tragic if people were to rush back in a
disorganized way,'' Sadruddin said at the end of his day in Kabul,
the first stop on a tour that will include Pakistan and Iran.
   ``We have to prepare for the refugees' return,'' he said. ``If
they have no life support system, no crops, no food, no shelter,
there will be very little hope of encouraging voluntary return.
What can be done in Afghan humanitarian assistance today can be the
glue for peace.''
   Sadruddin was U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the 1970s.
He is the uncle of the Aga Khan, hereditary leader of the Ismaili
sect of Islam, which has adherents in Pakistan and Afghanistan as
well as other Asian and Middle Eastern nations.
   The sound of artillery fire boomed across the mountains girding
Kabul a few minutes before his news conference at the airport.
   He did not set a timetable or a cost for returning the refugees
to Afghanistan.
   Four days before the Soviet withdrawal began, Sadruddin was
named the U.N. Special Coordinator for Humanitarian and Economic
Assistance to Afghanistan.
   During his brief time in Kabul he met Afghan leader Najib and
new Prime Minister Hasan Sharq, who has led Afghanistan's efforts
to repatriate refugees.
   Accompanying the prince were representatives of the Red Cross
and the Red Crescent, its Islamic equivalent, and of several U.N.
agencies, including World Health Organization and UNICEF, the U.N.
Children's Fund.
   U.N. programs for refugees ``must be free of political strings
and should not be used as a weapon,'' Sadruddin said.
   The United States has supplied weapons to Afghan guerrillas
operating from bases in Pakistan and has reserved the right to do
so as long as the Soviet Union supplies the Afghan army.
   If all Afghan refugees living abroad return home, it will be the
biggest repatriation in U.N. history. About one-third of
Afghanistan's pre-war population now lives outside the country.
   According to figures cited by U.N. official Geneva last month,
there are 3.1 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and 2.4 million
in Iran.

   President Reagan, the target of
embarrassing disclosures in books by former aides, says he probably
will write a book of his own to ``straighten out the record and
tell things as they really are.''
   However, the president indicated he wasn't happy about the idea.
   ``I don't look forward to it. I wrote a book once and found it
was quite a chore,'' said Reagan, the author of a 1965
autobiography entitled ``Where's the Rest of Me.''
   Reagan revealed his plans in a televised interview with two
Soviet journalists, broadcast Saturday night in the Soviet Union
after being taped last week in the Oval Office.
   ``I've been thinking very seriously about writing a book. In
view of the fact that several people who have left government have
written some books, I think maybe I better straighten out the
record and tell things as they really are,'' Reagan said.
   He said the presidential library to be built in southern
California after he leaves office will house the papers and
memorabilia that he collected.
   ``So there will be a record that is open for public view. But
I'll probably get around to writing a book.''
   ``For the Record,'' a recent book by former White House chief of
staff Donald T. Regan, portrayed Reagan as a hand-off leader whose
schedule was guided by astrological forecasts followed by his wife,
Nancy.
   Former White House spokesman Larry Speakes also drew an
unflattering portrait of Reagan in his book, ``Speaking Out,'' and
said he made up quotes for the president at the Geneva summit with
Gorbachev because Reagan was losing the public relations battle.
   Speakes said he also took words from Secretary of State George
P. Shultz and attributed them to Reagan after the Soviet Union shot
down a Korean airliner. Speakes said Reagan didn't have anything to
say on his own at meetings with key aides.

   The Duchess of York's polo-playing father, Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, was nearly dumped from the sport's ruling body
over allegations that he frequented prostitutes, the organization
said Saturday.
   The Hurlingham Polo Association, which governs the sport
throughout the British Commonwealth, voted down a resolution 7-6
that the 56-year-old major ``should be invited to tender his
resignation voluntarily,'' Brig. Peter Thwaites told The Associated
Press.
   Thwaites, chairman of the stewards committee, said he was among
those pressing for Ferguson's resignation as an association steward.
   ``I'm not for a moment saying we are all whiter than white. But
you can't really have a chap sitting in judgment over somebody else
who has, by his own confession, behaved badly,'' Thwaites said.
   The Sunday People, a mass-circulation tabloid, published a photo
on May 8 of Ferguson leaving the Wigmore Club, a London massage
parlor. It quoted prostitutes as saying he was ``one of their most
valued regular customers.''
   Ferguson was quoted at the time as dismissing the claim without
denying it, and has since refused to comment.
   Ferguson is a retired officer of Queen Elizabeth II's household
cavalry and is polo manager to her son and heir Prince Charles.
Ferguson's daughter Sarah is married to Prince Andrew, the queen's
second son.
   The resignation demand came up at a meeting of the association's
stewards committee Tuesday.
   ``I thought the honorable thing was for him to resign,''
Thwaites said. ``But he argued he had a great deal of support from
his family and friends and he didn't want to be ground down by what
he called the `gutter press'.''

   Carroll Bing, the wife of former Metropolitan
Opera impresario Sir Rudolf Bing, ``has lost touch with reality,''
says her lawyer, who won a request in court that she undergo a
psychiatric examination.
   Harvey Sladkus asked state Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick
to order that Lady Bing, a 48-year-old former mental patient, be
hospitalized and medicated ``for as long as necessary.''
   The Manhattan judge agreed Friday that a psychiatric exam was
warranted.
   ``I'm of the firm opinion that Lady Bing doesn't know what's
going on and cannot understand the court's mandates,'' Sladkus
said. ``She's disoriented and bewildered. She's frightened and
confused.
   ``We're seeing the disintegration of a human life.''
   Ciparick cited as examples reports that she had violated the
court's orders to leave her husband alone at certain hours and
reports she was arrested for allegedly assaulting one of her
86-year-old husband's nurses Tuesday night.
   Millard Midonick, Bing's court-appointed guardian, said he
expects tests of both Bing and Lady Bing to get under way early
this week. Bing suffers from Alzheimer's disease.
   Bing's lawyer, Paul Goldhamer, wants the marriage annulled. He
says Lady Bing has abused her husband verbally and physically, and
Bing did not know what he was doing when he married Lady Bing in
Arlington, Va., on Jan. 9, 1987.
   Goldhamer said that 15 seconds after his client agreed to marry
Lady Bing, he asked her, ``But dear, won't you tell me your name?''

   Mae Boren Axton, who co-wrote the Elvis

$18,000 for the financially strapped Nashville Symphony Orchestra.
   Ms. Axton, who now runs her own public relations agency, said
Friday that the money came from friends concerned about the
orchestra's plight. It was disbanded in February because of lack of
funds, leaving the town known as ``Music City USA'' without a

   Ms. Axton made the donation to a musician's group, the Nashville

   Former Houston Astros player Cesar Cedeno
was arrested on charges of assault, causing bodily injury and
resisting arrest after an attack on a woman identified as his
girlfriend and the mother of his child.
   The former outfielder was intoxicated and apparently angry over
custody of his 4-month-old daughter, said Webster Police Chief
Reyes Sonora.
   Pam Lamon, 32, was treated for bruises by ambulance personnel
and refused to be taken to a hospital, he said.
   ``It took three or four officers to put him in the car,'' Sonora
said. ``He was very belligerent.''
   Cedeno, 37, has had a series of run-ins with the law during and
after his 12-year career with the Astros. In 1974 he was convicted
of manslaughter and fined $100 in his native Dominican Republic for
shooting to death a 19-year-old woman.
   Cedeno was released Friday on $2,000 bail. He told police he is
unemployed.

   The gasoline tank on a church bus that
erupted into flames after being hit head-on by a pickup truck was
ruptured by a piece of the bus's springs, a published report says.
   Twenty-seven people _ mostly teen-agers _ were killed in the May
14 disaster on Interstate 71 near Carrollton. The driver of the
pickup, Larry W. Mahoney, 34, has pleaded innocent to 27 counts of
murder in the case.
   In its Friday editions, The Kentucky Post of Covington quoted an
unidentified source as saying the leaf-spring assembly broke loose
from the bus's frame, causing a 3-inch gash in the gas tank. The
leaf-spring assembly is a shock absorber built on curved strips of
metal.
   The newspaper quoted the source as saying that a protective cage
required on modern buses might not have prevented the tragedy.
   ``If the tank had been in a cage as now required on similar
buses, the puncture and ensuing fire might have happened a fraction
of a second sooner,'' the source said. ``I don't believe a cage
would have prevented the gash.''
   Alan Pollock, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety
Board in Washington, D.C., confirmed that investigators found a
3-inch gash in the tank of the First Assembly of God bus. He would
not say whether they have linked the puncture to the leaf spring
assembly.
   Meanwhile, the state police traffic accident report on the
disaster was filed Friday, but the 20-page report does not say what
caused the gash in the gas tank.
   State Police Capt. Neal Brittain said some details of the wreck
are not known. He said he could not discuss a cause of the
explosion ``simply because we can't'' at this time.
   He said a detailed reconstruction of the wreck will follow in a
supplemental report in two to three weeks.
   ``We want to make sure everything done in the reconstruction is
accurate,'' he said.
   The newspaper quoted its source as saying the reconstruction
indicates the bus driver turned to the left to avoid the pickup and
was hit on the right corner by the door.
   A left-hand curve lay just ahead of the bus. A night vision test
indicated the bus driver probably was not aware of the pickup until
the vehicles were about 350 feet apart, the newspaper said.
   At 350 feet, the drivers of vehicles traveling toward each at 60
mph would have approximately two seconds to react, according to the
report.
   The speed of the two vehicles has not been revealed by the
safety board or the state police.

   Here are excerpts from the interview
that President Reagan gave Soviet journalists for broadcast in the
Soviet Union in advance of the Moscow summit.
   The text of the interview, which was conducted before Reagan
left Washington, was released Saturday by the White House staff in
Helsinki. Questions were translated from Russian.
   Q: Mr. President, you are about to visit Moscow. This will be
your first trip to our country. With what feelings do you travel to
the Soviet Union and what do you expect at your next summit?
   REAGAN: Well, this will be the fourth meeting between the
General Secretary and myself. I am obviously looking forward to the
trip for one reason, because I have never been there, and I'm
looking forward to seeing your country and, well, as much as is
possible with the meetings that will be going on. And we have
discussed in the previous meetings with your General Secretary such
matters as arms reductions, and we've been successful on the one
treaty. We are both working on the present treaty that we call
START, the 50 percent reduction of intercontinental ballistic
missiles, but also, some differences that we've had on our
interpretation of human rights, on regional affairs, and we are
greatly heartened by the fact that your forces are withdrawing from
Afghanistan, and on bilateral issues, such things as rescue at sea
agreements, fisheries agreements, things of that kind, in which
we've made great progress.
   Q: What is your view for the possibility for further advancement
(toward peace?)
   REAGAN: Well, I have to be optimistic about it. I have read
``Perestroika'' cover-to-cover, and the goals that were outlined
there for your own country and by your present leader were such
that I think it would reduce some of the differences between us
further, and make it possible for future leaders of our countries
to eliminate the _ well, what I called for in the _ in our first
meeting in Geneva. When just the General Secretary and I were
talking to each other, I pointed out that we didn't mistrust each
other because we were armed, we're armed because we mistrust each
other. And that we had a unique opportunity, the two of us, to go
to work, not just to try and reduce arms, but to reduce the causes
of the mistrust...
   Q: Mr. President ... an opinion is forming in Moscow that it
would hardly be possible to sign a treaty on the 50 percent
reduction of strategic nuclear weapons while observing the INF
Treaty. And what is your perspective on the completion of such an
agreement that would further peace?
   REAGAN: Well, I still think it can be concluded, but it would
be, I think, overly optimistic with the time limitations to believe
that it could be ready for signature as the INF Treaty was here in
the previous meeting. But we're going to continue negotiating...
   Q: Do you believe that it will be signed _ this treaty?
   REAGAN: Yes. I do. I don't think either of us have gone this far
with the idea that it wasn't a good idea.
   ...
   Q: Could you at the beginning of your presidency, when you had
just entered the Oval Office, imagine the possibility of your
upcoming visit to Moscow?
   REAGAN: Probably not, because very frankly, I have to say, I
think there is a difference between this General Secretary and
other leaders of your country that I have met with in the past. I
don't think they had any dreams of perestroika. And yet, I felt
that we had to exist in the world together. Our systems are
different, we're going to be competitive in a number of ways, and
that'll continue, but we can be competitive without being hostile
to the point of conflict with each other. And I think this is what
we're aiming at. And no, I could not have foreseen your present
leader.
   Q: Well, new times bring new leaders.
   REAGAN: Yes.
   Q: Is it possible to conclude that you expect that your
successor will continue the course of stabilization of
Soviet-American relations, that there will not be a break in the
dialogue between our countries?
   REAGAN: Well, if the next president is the president I would
like to see there, the present vice president, I know he would
continue on this track. But I think that our people want this. I
had a visit just the other day here in the White House with 78
young teenagers and half of them were from the Soviet Union and
half were students of ours... And you looked out at those young
people, and you couldn't say, ``Well, those are Russians and those
are Americans.'' You just saw young people who had learned to know
each other, exchange ideas, and get acquainted. And I found myself
saying to them, if all the young people of the world could get to
know each other, there'd never be another war.
   ...
   Q: The majority of presidents in this country at the end of
their term of office write their memoirs. Are you preparing to
write your memoirs, and when can we, if so, get a chance to read
them?
   REAGAN: Well, I've been thinking very seriously about writing a
book in view of the fact that several people who have left
government have written some books, I think maybe I'd better
straighten out the record and tell things as they really are. And
so, it's possible I will.
   Q: Since our time is up, more or less, I'd like to thank you for
the interview and wish you great success in the future.
   REAGAN: Well, thank you very much. May I just say one thing,
also, in getting to your country. And I would relish the
opportunity, if I could, to say a few words here that is never
discussed very much. I have a great admiration for the women of the
Soviet Union, particularly in the Russian area. From the outside
looking, they seem to be a great bulwark of strength and solidity
in the maintaining of the home, in the things that they stand for _
the standing in lines to bring home what is necessary for the
family, and all of that. And I just wonder if they're getting the
credit within your country that I think they deserve.
   Q: They do deserve it, but they don't just stand in lines. The
overwhelming majority of them work together with men ...
   REAGAN: Yes.
   Q: ... And I hope you will be able, with your own eyes, to see
all of this when you come to our country.
   REAGAN: Well, you've said it better than I did. But yes, I
recognize all of those things, and just wondered if they get the
recognition they deserve within their own country.

   The arms control treaty President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev came close to
agreeing to in ``raise-you-one'' negotiations in Iceland is on the
table again in Moscow _ still enticing and still elusive.
   But U.S. officials do not expect Reagan to engage this time in
impromptu, derring-do, head-to-head negotiating with Gorbachev of
the sort they partook in at Reykjavik in October 1986.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have been negotiating,
off and on, since 1982 on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known
as START. The United States proposed a 30 percent cut in both
nations' stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union
countered by proposing 50 percent.
   But U.S. officials said Saturday that prospects for further
progress in Moscow had dimmed because a prospective
``confidence-building'' measure due to be approved there had fallen
through.
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway said the Soviets
had turned down a U.S. proposal for pre-notification of missile
test launches.
   She did not explain why the tentative agreement to notify each
other before missiles test launchings had fallen through.
   Mrs. Ridgway indicated the Soviets wanted a more sweeping
``confidence-building'' measure that was unacceptable to the United
States.
   It looked for a moment like Gorbachev and Reagan might have a
deal _ or at least agreement at the top on the framework for a deal
_ when they met in Iceland.
   But Reagan's dream of a space-based missile defense system _
Star Wars _ proved too great a stumbling block.
   Gorbachev wanted testing limited to the laboratory. Reagan
wanted real world testing. They could not agree and parted in
disappointment. START went back to Geneva, where both sides have
been negotiating.
   Now it appears too late for a START agreement. Soviet officials
say more than 1,200 points of disagreement exist.
   The issue is awesomely complex, especially the question of
verification. Strategic weapons can be delivered by bombers or
missiles.
   Missiles can be fired from land, planes, ships or submarines.
Land-fired missiles can be launched from fixed sites, or movable
sites _ mobile missiles systems of which the Soviets have two and
the United States have none.
   The two sides are unable to find acceptable ways to verify
cutbacks in such easily hidden systems.
   Another issue is whether a START agreement would ban existing or
future intercontinental ballistic missile systems.
   On top of that, Reagan's Star Wars program remains a seemingly
insurmountable obstacle. The Soviets want to restrict tests in
space, and will not agree to cuts in offensive weapons unless they
can call the reductions off if they conclude Star Wars violates the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   ``It's now clear there is no way these questions can be shaped
up in treaty form in time for the summit,'' Secretary of State
George P. Shultz said May 12 in Geneva, Switzerland after winding
up pre-summit talks with his Soviet counterpart, Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   That being the case, U.S. officials do no expect Reagan to try
to bridge the gap in face-to-face talks with Gorbachev.
   At their first summit in Geneva in 1985, the two leaders spent
time alone, in front of a roaring fireplace, and then walking
outside in the snappy Swiss fall air.
   The informality of the arrangement, with only their interpreters
present, helped break the ice.
   As they strolled back from a conversation in a garden gazebo,
Gorbachev accepted Reagan's proposal for annual summit meetings.
Apparently, that was the only time in their three summit meetings
that one-on-one sessions produced a substantive result.
   At their second summit, in Reykjavik, Reagan was alone with
Gorbachev for about 25 minutes, mostly discussing human rights.
When they turned to the detailed issue of arms control _ and
swapped proposals that escalated until it seemed there would be a
breakthrough in the arms race _ Reagan had Shultz at his side.
   Reykjavik did set the stage for the treaty signed by Reagan and
Gorbachev last December in Washington to eliminate all U.S. and
Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   In Washington, Reagan and Gorbachev were alone for about a
half-hour. Again, the subject was human rights.
   In Moscow, apart from the opening night dinner, Reagan's program
calls for two private sessions with Gorbachev.
   The first will be in the Kremlin, shortly after the president
arrives from Helsinki, Finland. A Gorbachev greeting is all that is
anticipated. On Reagan's third day in Moscow they will be alone
again.
   U.S. officials said Saturday that, in fact, it now seems
unlikely the two sides will sign protocols in Moscow calling for
experiments to establish more thorough means of verifying two
treaties that have been agreed upon but never verified by the
Senate _ although experts believe both sides are adhering to them.
   These are the Threshhold Test Ban Treaty signed on July 3, 1974
and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty signed May 28, 1976,
banning nuclear tests greater than 150 kilotons (more than 100
times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb in World War II).
   Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the president's national security
adviser, said two agreements on monitoring underground nuclear test
explosions were not likely to be ready for Reagan and Gorbachev to
approve.
   The first deals with trying out U.S. and Soviet measuring
devices at test explosions in July and August.The joint experiments
in Nevada and at Semipalatinsk apparently will proceed in July and
August.
   But Powell said that ``a few technical issues have to be
resolved.'' The second protocol deals with so-called peaceful test
explosions. Powell said negotiators were having difficulty
reconciling the Russian and English versions.
   Reagan has said he would submit the 1974 and 1976 treaties to
the Senate for ratification if verification measures were improved.
It was not clear if the setback in summit plans would affect his
plan.
   Gorbachev, in a grand gesture, may announce the unilateral
withdrawal of 50,000 to 100,000 forward-based Soviet troops in
Europe in an effort to spur agreement on a reduction of both sides'
conventional forces in Europe.
   Western experts say the Soviet bloc has a 2-1 advantage over the
West in conventional forces. The Mutual and Balanced Force
Reduction Talks went on for 14 years without producing agreement.
   Finally, the superpowers may agree on ways to bring about a
worldwide ban on chemical weapons. Forty nations are negotiating at
the United Nations Committee on Disarmament on a ban, but the talks
are stalled over the intrusive verification measures that would be
required to assure compliance. These weapons can be manufactured in
ordinary chemical factories without attracting attention.

   A bomb exploded Saturday at
Johannesburg's main railroad station, and radio reports said one
woman was injured.
   Near the city of Durban, three blacks were killed when five men
with shotguns opened fire on a house in a black township, police
said.
   Police confirmed the Johannesburg blast but said no further
details were available.
   The blast came two days after bombings in Pretoria injured four
white women. Those blasts coincided with the 40th anniversary of
the governing Nationalist Party's rise to power.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok blamed the Pretoria bombings
on the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, the
main group fighting to topple South Africa's white-led government.
   In South Africa, the 26 million blacks have no voice in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate schools, districts and health services.
   The shooting victims near the southeastern city of Durban were
members of a family that had participated in a wedding Friday
evening in Shongwni township, police said.
   The 17-year-old brother of the bride was among those killed,
police said. They said the bride's mother was seriously wounded.
   Police said they were investigating but had not determined the
motive for the attack. The township has been the scene of black
factional fighting in recent weeks.

   A judge has ordered a woman to stop
smoking, saying that she can't afford it because she has five
children and no job.
   Judge Leonard Hoffman, a two-pack-a-day smoker until he quit on
Oct. 15, 1956, said it was the first time he has ordered a
defendant to stop smoking.
   ``I'd probably do it again,'' said Hoffman, who describes
himself as ``a square.''
   Julie Weatherbee Lunceford was in court on a probation hearing,
the Greenville Herald-Banner reported Friday.
   ``She came to me pleading poverty and I don't know why, but I
said, `Do you smoke?' and she said, `Yes,' and I said, `How in the
world can you afford to? You said you don't have a job,''' Hoffman
said.
   ``The surgeon general said it's addictive, it's been publicly
declared an addiction. The woman said she had no job. Why should
the taxpaying public subsidize an addiction?''
   Lunceford, who is on welfare, was sentenced to five years
probation in 1983 for theft of cattle. She was accused of failing
to report to her probation officer for two years and Hoffman,
visiting from Dallas County, ordered her to resume reporting and
quit smoking in 30 days.
   He said it would be up to the Hunt County Adult Probation
Department to enforce his order.
   Lunceford's lawyer, Peter Chamberlain, said the 23-year-old
defendant was relieved by the no-smoking sentence since she could
have been sent to prison. Hoffman said he did not consider prison
because of her children.

   President Reagan, in an interview
broadcast Saturday in the Soviet Union, said he had great
admiration for Soviet women and wondered if they were getting
enough credit for running their homes and standing in store lines.
   His comment drew an immediate response from a Soviet
interviewer, who said women do more than housework, but also work
in administrative posts, teach and perform other duties.
   The exchange came at the end of an unusual interview in the Oval
Office last week. At the invitation of the White House, two Soviet
television journalists flew to Washington from Moscow and asked
Reagan questions for half an hour.
   The journalists told Reagan his interview would have an audience
of 200 million in the Soviet Union.
   As the inteviewers thanked Reagan for his time, the president
asked to say one more thing.
   ``I would relish the opportunity to say a few words here that is
never discussed very much,'' Reagan said.
   ``I have a great admiration for the women of the Soviet Union,
particularly in the Russian area.
   ``From the outside looking (in), they seem to be a great bulwark
of strength and solidity in the maintaining of the home and the
things that they stand for _ the standing in lines to bring home
what is necessary for the family, and all of that,'' Reagan said.
   ``And, I just wonder if they're getting the credit within your
country that I think they deserve,'' the president said.
   ``They deserve it,'' one of the interviewers replied immediately.
   ``They don't just stand in lines, but the majority of them work
together with men,'' the interviewer said.
   ``They teach, they take care of children, they work in
administrative posts, and so forth,'' the interviewer said. ``And I
hope that with your own eyes you will be able to see all of that
when you come to our country.''
   In reply, Reagan said, ``Well, you've said it better than I did,
but yes, I recognize all of those things, and just wondered if they
get the recognition they deserve within their country.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities foiled a plan Saturday
to smuggle 264 Asians, mostly Tamils, to Canada aboard a ship, a
police spokesman said.
   Police were looking for a 38-year-old Tamil suspected of
organizing the trip, according to spokesman Bernd Metterhausen. The
suspect, who was not identified, is believed to have arranged a
similar passage of Tamils to Canada nearly two years ago,
Metterhausen told reporters.
   Metterhausen said police discovered the plan shortly before the
Asians were supposed to board a ship in Hamburg's harbor early
Saturday. They were found in an abandoned hotel in Hittfeld near
the northern port.
   A patrol of plainclothesmen noticed a suspicious-looking column
of two limousines and a truck driving through Hamburg, the police
spokesman said. They followed the convoy and discovered the group
in the abandoned building.
   ``The building was full to the roof with asylum seekers,''
Metterhausen said.
   Authorities suspected the Tamil organizer of pocketing about
$2,900 for each refugee.
   The group consisted of 257 Tamils, five Indians and two
Bengalis, he said.
   Documents in the three vehicles revealed that the group was
supposed to board the Lupa, a West German-registered ship.
   Police searched the ship and arrested its owner and captain. He
was being questioned but denied any role in the smuggling plan,
police said.
   Metterhausen said police had received several tips in recent
weeks that there were plans to smuggle a large number of Tamils to
Canada. Police had noticed a larger than usual presence of Tamils
in Hamburg in recent days, he said.
   In August 1986, 155 Tamils were taken by ship from West Germany
and abandoned in lifeboats off the coast of Newfoundland. They were
rescued by Canadian officials and permitted to stay.
   West Germany is host to about 30,000 Tamil refugees who have
fled civil strife in Sri Lanka, where Tamil rebels are fighting for
a separate nation.
   The refugees discovered Saturday were placed under care of the
Red Cross, Metterhausen said.
   They will be sent back to the West German towns where they
applied for asylum, he said.

   Bulldozers flattened 50 vacant city homes in
an attempt by the mayor's office to quash the crack problem, and
columns of smoke rose over the city from heaps of rubble ignited by
construction crews.
   ``It's a win-win situation,'' Mayor Sandy Freedman said Friday
as demolition crews finished three days of work. ``One lady who
lives near a house we tore down on Seventh Avenue called this
morning to say she'd slept better last night than she had in
years.''
   Of the 50 condemned structures on the mayor's list, a dozen were
known crack houses, and the others are likely to become centers of
criminal activity, a release from the mayor's office said. Crack is
a smokable form of cocaine.
   ``Any vacant house within a high drug area is a potential crack
house,'' said police Maj. Bert Hatcher.
   The campaign has adopted the slogan, ``Mayor's Crack Down.''
   ``I'll sure feel more safe getting in and out of my car when
this job is done,'' said Louise Brown, a teacher at a nursery.
   Meanwhile, fire officials arrested a man after he allegedly told
them he joined in on the destruction and set fire to a crack house.
   State fire investigator A. Alcala said he hated to arrest the
21-year-old John Marshall Aydelotte, but he had no choice after
Adyelotte described how he ignited a cardboard box Friday and
tossed it into one of three vacant houses.
   The resulting blaze consumed that building and heavily damaged
the other two. None of the three buildings was among the 50 slated
for destruction.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's failed effort to
induce Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega to surrender power
was riddled with blunders and miscalculations, according to a
number of independent experts.
   But while many of the experts found fault with the way the
administration handled the negotiations, they had few ideas on what
the United States can do now to achieve its goals of an apolitical
military and restoring constitutional rule in Panama.
   ``We're in for the long haul,'' said Eva Loser of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
   To some experts, the United States looked both foolish and weak
after Noriega refused last Wednesday to sign on to a U.S.-brokered
package deal that called for his resignation in August and
temporary departure from Panama while an election process took
place.
   ``I think that what's happened is we've really seen the limits
of U.S. intervention,'' said Douglas Bandow of the Cato Institute.
``And despite the fact that we're a superpower, we would have
trouble killing a fly.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams defended the
negotiations in a telephone interview, saying, ``People critical of
the negotiations criticized us when we were not negotiating. That's
called politics.'' Abrams argued that the negotiations revealed
America's good faith and Noriega's lack of it.
   James Hackett, an associate at the Heritage Foundation, said
that the administration's first mistake was in bringing drug
smuggling indictments last February against Noriega.
   ``You don't go around indicting foreign presidents or rulers,''
said Hackett, a former foreign service officer who once served in
Panama.
   ``It was a very unfortunate thing to try to do,'' he said. ``The
whole thing was handled poorly.''
   Douglas Bandow of the Cato Institute agreed that it's a ``little
crazy'' to blame other countries for a U.S. drug problem.
   Several of the experts were unable to recall any instance in
which federal indictments were handed down against a foreign
leader. The closest recent parallel to the Noriega case was the
1985 indictment and subsequent conviction of Norman Sanders, a
former chief minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British
dependency in the Caribbean.
   Abrams, in the interview on Friday, discounted criticism of the
indictments. ``The indictments drove Noriega crazy and gave us a
terrific bargaining tool,'' Abrams said. ``For negotiating
purposes, they turned out to be useful,'' he added, suggesting that
administration envoys would not have come as close to an agreement
as they did without them.
   Ms. Loser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies
said that what started out as an internal Panamanian problem
``snowballed into a bilateral problem.''
   Ms. Loser, who recently returned from a visit to Panama, said
that the United States mistakenly ``treated him (Noriega) like
two-bit tin horn dictator. That's not how you treat someone of that
caliber.''
   Ms. Loser said that the United States ``should maintain and
tighten'' existing economic sanctions against Panama. She said
Noriega is being aided economically by the money being poured into
the Panamanian economy by the 50,000 Americans living there and she
recommended a way be found to limit the amount of money spent by
Americans from circulating in Panama.
   Ambler Moss, a former ambassador to Panama, agreed with Ms.
Loser that the United States should have joined with other Latin
American countries in the attempt to negotiate a settlement.
   ``I think we missed a good bet all along by going it alone and
becoming the principal actor unilaterally in somebody else's
internal political crisis,'' he said.
   Moss also said Secretary of State George P. Shultz may have been
wrong in saying last Wednesday that the talks with Noriega had
ended when the Panamanian leader backed out of a deal that his
subordinates had negotiated.
   Moss said that it was possible that the deal was vetoed by
Noriega's subordinates who were worried that the deal did not
protect their interests.
   ``After all, Noriega isn't the only bad apple in the barrel,''
Moss said. ``A number of them apparently, according to the
indictments, have been engaged in the drug business. They may
wonder where all this leaves them at the end of the day and when
there is a cleanup, they're going to be the ones that get cleaned
up.''
   But Abrams disagreed with that theory. He said the most likely
explanation was that Noriega, after overseeing a prolonged
negotiating process, could not bring himself to accept a deal that
required him to say, ``I'm through.''

<HEAD>New Austerity Program Introduced With Massive Price Hikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday announced
massive price hikes and a 23.9 percent devaluation of the Yugoslav
currency as part of an austerity program aimed at reducing rampant
inflation and a huge foreign debt.
   Gasoline prices Saturday increased an average of 36.1 percent;
electricity 31.4 percent; postal services 28.1 percent; rail
transport 38.5 percent; and coal 30.3 percent, a government
announcement said.
   The government also lifted price controls on about 60 percent of
commodities at a time when Yugoslavia's inflation is hovering at
about 170 percent, Europe's highest.
   Thousands of workers have protested the measures since they were
first unveiled in May, staging a wave of strikes across the
country. More than 300 miners from Tuzla in central Yugoslavia
traveled on foot and by bus to Belgrade last week to join the
protests.
   ``How can I do heavy physical work if I am hungry?'' one miner
lamented.
   The austerity package calls for a reduction in wages of up to 30
percent at a time when 80 percent of manufacturers have announced
higher prices for their products. The prices have been frozen since
November.
   ``Prices will go up and wages down. How can we survive?''
another protester asked Yugoslav officials in the federal
Parliament.
   The unpopular measures, aimed at curbing the inflation rate and
repaying the $20 billion foreign debt, are expected to worsen
Yugoslavia's living standards, which have already declined by
one-third since 1980.
   The government has prepared an emergency social welfare program
to assist those with the lowest incomes, according to the state-run
Tanjug news service. The prices of such staples as cooking oil,
flour and milk remained frozen, but producers will be compensated
by the state, the government said.
   ``With those prices, we can barely afford to purchase staples,''
said Dragan Petrovic, a Belgrade civil engineer. He was interviewed
at a gas station, where the price of regular gasoline is almost $2
a gallon.
   ``I will have to stop driving my car,'' he said.
   The gasoline price hike resulted from the devaluation of the
Yugoslav currency, the dinar, which has pushed up the price of
foreign oil in local currency.
   Saturday's devaluation is intended to decrease the country's
foreign debt by making Yugoslav goods cheaper abroad. However, the
measure may at the same time make many imports too expensive for
Yugoslavs to buy.
   The dinar was last devalued in November 1987, but it has
continued to lose ground against foreign currencies. In relation to
the American dollar, the value of the dinar has dropped more than
250 percent in just a year.
   The new economic package was originally scheduled to start May
15 but was put off because of the lack of new loans from Western
creditors.
   Introduction of the measures, adopted in conjuction with the
International Monetary Fund, appeared to indicate that Yugoslavia
had obtained about $400 million in new Western credits which
government said were necessary to back up the austerity program.
   The country will need an additional $600 million loan before the
end of 1988 to sustain the new measures, Tanjug said Saturday.
   But it also said there were realistic possibilities in the
current negotiations with foreign creditors for a long-term
rescheduling of $10.5 billion of Yugoslavia's debt.

   Actor Judge Reinhold hasn't forgotten
growing up in Fredericksburg, ``a little Southern town ... where
there was really all the time in the world with nothing to do. The
only recreation was mindless cruising.''
   ``My first car was a '63 Chevy station wagon that I called
Ramona, because that's the sound it made. `FARM USE' was painted on
the back. It was right off the set of `Hee Haw,''' Reinhold said,

   He said Marines stationed at the nearby Quantico base ``would
drive up behind me and my long-haired friends at red lights and
start screaming sexual come-ons at us. Some of them, even after we
turned around, thought we were just ugly girls.''

<HEAD>Soviet Union Warns of Slowing Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union indicated Saturday it might slow
the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan if Pakistan keeps aiding
the Afghan guerrillas, and it accused Washington of fueling the war
with ``lavish supplies'' to the rebels.
   The Foreign Ministry statement came one day before President
Reagan's arrival in Moscow for his fourth summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Soviet threat appeared likely to push the
Afghan war toward the top of the agenda during meetings between the
two leaders.
   The Soviets said if Pakistan did not halt ``interference in the
internal affairs of Afghanistan,'' they would ``draw pertinent
conclusions with respect to the timetable of the troop withdrawal
and take concrete steps.''
   ``The bellicose mood of the Pakistani leadership is backed up by
the lavish supplies of U.S. arms to Pakistan, intended specifically
for the anti-government Afghan forces, which does not serve the
goal of ending the fratricidal war between the Afghans,'' said the
statement, which was carried by the Tass news agency and the
evening news show Vremya.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said
she saw nothing new in the situation and cited statements of
Secretary of State George Shultz at last month's signing of the
troop withdrawal agreement.
   Shultz told Soviet officials then that the United States had the
right to provide military aid to the Afghan resistance was ready to
exercise that right, but was also prepared to meet restraint with
restraint.
   ``There is no change in our position,'' said Ms. Stockman.
   The United States has been supplying Afghan rebels with an
estimated $500 million annually in arms and other military supplies
channeled through Pakistan. It has pledged to continue to do so as
long as the Soviet Union keeps up its military support of the
Afghan government.
   The Soviet Union began on May 15 withdrawing its more than
100,000 troops from Afghanistan under the accord signed in Geneva.
The troops intervened in 1979 to back the Afghan government in its
war with Moslem guerrillas.
   The Foreign Ministry statement said that since May 15, 10,000
troops had been withdrawn from Afghanistan. During the same period,
the statement said, ``over 100 vehicles (carrying weapons) were
dispatched from Islamabad'' to guerrilla bases along the
Afghan-Pakistani border.
   ``If the Pakistani side does not adopt appropriate measures to
end interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan from its
territory, the Soviet Union reserves the right to react to this in
a manner as warranted by the situation,'' the Foreign Ministry
statement said.
   ``It was only within the context of the ... agreement on
non-interference (in Geneva) that it became possible to agree on
the question of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan,''
the statement said.
   In the last two weeks, Soviet officials and media have
repeatedly complained that Pakistan has failed to keep its part of
the non-interference pact and continued to aid the rebels.
   A Gorbachev aide also complained on Friday that the United
States had violated the Geneva accords by continuing to ship
weapons to the guerrillas. Yevgeny Primakov said the United States
was jeopardizing the accords.
   For their part, the rebels have pledged to use force to dislodge
the Soviet-backed government and put a Moslem government in its
place.

   It took six planes and 22 parachute
packers, but Dale Nelson has set what he thinks is a record _ 301
dives in less than 24 hours, about 4{ minutes per jump.
   He said he completed the feat Friday, which raised thousands of
dollars for four charities, with no fear and no stress.
   Witnesses said Nelson completed 301 consecutive skydives between
5 p.m. Thursday and about 3:30 p.m. Friday, surpassing the mark of
250 listed by the Guinness Book of World Records.
   ``I'm not that tired. It was an adrenaline rush all 24 hours,''
Nelson, 38 and a father of two teen-agers, said in a telephone
interview shortly after completing jump No. 301.
   Over and over again, Nelson would ride an airplane to 2,000
feet, jump out and parachute to a landing, take off the used
`chute, strap on a freshly packed one, and climb on another waiting
airplane.
   With a crew of pilots and 22 parachute packers, Nelson, a
291-jump veteran before the record attempt, said he never feared
for his safety.
   ``It was 100 percent trust _ zero stress,'' he said.
   David Huber, of Issaquah, Wash., set the 250-jump mark over the
Fourth of July weekend in 1985. Nelson's jumps won't be noted as a
record until the Guinness editors verify the feat through
interviews with witnesses, according to David Boehm, American
editor for Guinness.
   Nelson, of Bryn Mawr, received $26,000 in cash and pledges
before he started jumping and has gathered more money through
donations, parking fees and sales of $10 T-shirts to the roughly
1,000 people who dropped by the New Hanover Airport to watch, said
Nelson's sister, Judy Nelson.
   Ms. Nelson said she and her brother had budgeted about $16,000
of the money for expenses, but many pilots and parachute packers
donated their time.
   ``I'd guess it will be about half that. We'll have to pay for
gasoline and some plane expense,'' she said.
   Nelson reserved six airplanes, with only two in use at any one
time, his sister said.

   Graduation is a family affair for the
Simmses, with mother, father and daughter all getting diplomas from
different schools in a three-week period.
   Mary Simms of Hinton graduated from Concord College on May 14.
Her husband, Ralph, is in line for a degree Saturday from the West
Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine at Lewisburg. Their
daughter, Susan, graduates Friday from Hinton High School.
   Susan's graduation announcements listed all three graduates, but
her parents say they're not trying to steal the spotlight.
   ``We tried to give everybody equal billing,'' Mrs. Simms said.
``We know graduation is an important time for Susan. We are not
taking away from her attention. She's still the one getting the
gifts.''
   In fact, Susan said her unusual situation is getting her more
attention that the average high school graduate.
   ``All my friends at school think it's pretty neat that we're
doing it at the same time,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The folks in Lake Wobegon must be
wondering what in the world has gotten into that boy. Garrison
Keillor has taken to the city.
   ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' the most popular show on public
radio, is coming back, temporarily. But the endless cornfields are
shadowed by skyscrapers and all those Norwegian bachelor farmers
are rubbing elbows with the homeless.
   One year after it ended its 13-year run, Keillor's uniquely
personal show will be broadcast next Saturday from New York's Radio
City Music Hall, miles and worlds apart from its former home in
Minnesota.
   And while the new show finds Keillor still fantasizing about
Lake Wobegon, the little town that time forgot, it reflects his
fascination with his new home, New York City.
   The new show, a one-time special being called ``The 2nd Annual
Farewell Performance,'' made its non-broadcast debut with three
performances this weekend at Middlebury College. There will also be
three shows in New York, including the Saturday show that is to be
on radio and cable television.
   When his faithful audience last heard from Keillor, it was June
13, 1987. The nation's most famous shy person was saying farewell
to ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' his eclectic mix of music and wit
that had been broadcast live from St. Paul, Minn.
   ``It simply is time to go,'' he had said, detailing his plans to
move to his wife's native country, Denmark, and return to writing.
   Keillor's move to Denmark, though, lasted only a few months. He
found it difficult to live in a land so foreign, with a language
with those ``strange words that sound like singing birds.''
   Keillor simply became homesick. He told his Middlebury audience
Friday that he would see ``those sweet, sweet pictures of the USA''
and ``I would miss my hometown. It's become a paradise ever since
I've moved away.''
   But Keillor opted against moving back to Minnesota. Instead, he
headed to the Big Apple.
   And while his new show is still peppered with commercials from
those familiar faces and familiar places, like Lake Wobegon's
Chatterbox Cafe, ``where the coffeepot is always on, which is why
it tastes that way,'' it is clear this chronicler of rural life is
smitten with city ways.
   ``New York is the strangest city I've ever seen,'' he told his
Middlebury audience, conceding, though, ``I like New York a lot.''
   His fascination with the city shows up in ``The Adventures of
Buster the Show Dog,'' a regular fixture on the old program. The
latest installment finds Buster lost in Manhattan as his owners
fight through grime and step over the homeless to find their pet,
asking New Yorkers, ``How come you have to be so rude all the
time?''
   Although Keillor himself said Friday he was rustier than he
thought after a year away, it was clear his wit remains sharp.
   Some Keillorisms:
   _ Squinting at the audience after the opening of the show, he
said, ``People had told me you'd put on weight. I don't think you
have.''
   _ He described the month of March as ``the month God designed to
show people who don't drink what a hangover is like.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>`He urged a one-year moratorium on publishing to give people</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   time to read what's already been written. The author of the
best-selling ``Lake Wobegon Days'' suggested creation of a federal
prose stabilization program ``to pay us writers not to write''
during that year.
   _ He said the motto of The New York Times is, ``The world is not
chaotic; it is run by reasonable people and we know them.''
   Asked whether New York now felt like home, he said after
Friday's performance: ``Yes, it does. I didn't realize that until I
flew out to Minnesota recently.''
   The new farewell show will be broadcast on American Public Radio
and the Disney television channel on Saturday, June 4, at 8 p.m.
EDT.
   Keillor said he does not have any plans to return Prairie Home
to weekly broadcasts, but does plan to continue to do farewell
shows every June. He does not plan to do any of those at his old
home of the World Theater, though.
   ``I don't think one can ever go back,'' he said.

   Assailants opened fire with
submachine guns in a pizza parlor and killed two leftist leaders
and a bodyguard, police said Saturday.
   The attack in this central town Friday night killed Carlos
Batista, the leader of the assembly in Meta state; Nestor Henry
Rojas, a former mayoral candidate in the town of Puerto Gaitan; and
Jose Antonio Riveras, a bodyguard, Villavencio police said in a
news release.
   All three men were members of the leftist Patriotic Union.
   In the past two years, right-wing death squads have allegedly
killed about 550 members of the Patriotic Union, in addition to
hundreds more peasants, teachers, university students and
sympathizers of leftist causes in Colombia.
   The Patriotic Union has accused the army of controlling the
death squads, but Defense Minister Rafael Samudio has denied the
accusation.
   Villavicencio, the capital of Meta state, is at the foot of the
Andes, 45 miles southeast of the capital of Bogota.

   Michael Dukakis traded jokes with comedians Robin
Williams and Billy Crystal on Saturday, but when the humor started
to turn off-color, the Democratic presidential front-runner
jokingly told Williams to tone it down.
   The two comedians were presenting a $217,000 check for homeless
assistance to a Boston health care group.
   Handing the check to Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, Crystal
said: ``You'll need two forms of ID if you have them. But hold it
till Thursday.''
   The exchange took place at a Statehouse ceremony in which the
Boston Health Care for the Homeless Project received the check from
Comic Relief, a organizations formed by 80 comedians in 1986 which
has raised $4.7 million for the homeless in 23 cities nationwide.
   ``Speaking of comic relief, we had some yesterday,'' Dukakis
said.
   ``The vice president said his cholesterol level was going up. He
was angry and his cholesterol level was going up. I wonder what he
meant by that.''
   Dukakis got a laugh, but Crystal got a bigger one.
   ``Too much fat in the budget,'' he said.
   ``You can use that. I think it'll work,'' Crystal added, turning
to Dukakis. ``But you've got to give it some punch.''
   ``We are delighted to be here to celebrate the cholesterol level
of Mr. Bush and the rising formaldehyde level of President
Reagan,'' Crystal said. ``We met at this hour because Mercury and
Jupiter were in perfect alignment.''
   Williams said he had yet to perfect an impersonation of Dukakis,
but he did step forward and with an upbeat voice and choppy
delivery characteristic of the governor.
   ``I'm working on it right now because I'm feeling really good
about it. I haven't got it yet but I hope too soon.
   ``If he gets into the White House, his ass will be on the
line,'' Williams said.
   When Williams made one off-color remark that was a play on
astrological and anatomical terms, Dukakis told him to stop it.
   ``This is not HBO (Home Box Office),'' the Massachusetts
governor said. ``This is the governor's press conference.''
   Dukakis took the opportunity to charge the Reagan administration
with failing to build adequate housing for the nation's homeless
and pledged to reverse the trend if elected.
   He said state funding for the homeless had increased to $166
million from $11.8 million in the last five years and the
Legislature has authorized more than $1 billion for construction of
affordable housing for working and low-income families.
   ``There's only one reason today we have homeless people in
America,'' Dukakis said. ``It's because we aren't building
affordable housing for people of low and moderate income. It's as
simple as that.
   ``If all goes well this fall we're going to start building
affordable housing for families and businesses of low and moderate
income.''

<HEAD>After Melee, Guard Planned For Rescheduled UCLA Student Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After student protesters overturned ballot
boxes, upended polling booths and exchanged blows with workers
during a student election, UCLA officials said a rescheduled vote
will be heavily guarded.
   Winston Doby, vice chancellor of student affairs at the
University of California, Los Angeles, said Friday the school was
investigating Thursday's melee and was exploring the possibility of
disciplinary action.
   A group of about 200 mostly minority students marched on polling
places after a heated rally protesting the disqualification of a
Hispanic candidate, Lloyd Monserratt, for student body president.
   ``I've never seen, in my history at UCLA, students disrupt a
free and open election,'' Doby said. ``Whenever you have a
challenge to the free and open electoral process, you have to view
that as a very critical and serious problem because that principle
underlies a free democracy.''
   No arrests or serious injuries were reported.
   Some Monserratt supporters contended his disqualification, after
he won the campus primary three weeks ago, was racially motivated.
   Monserratt was removed from the ballot by the school's student
governing body, the Undergraduate Student Association Council,
because of a sub-par grade point average and a lack of college
credits, Doby said.
   He blamed the disqualification for the election fracas, and
admitted racial tensions exist on the campus.
   ``I think there's no question that in our student politics,
there is racial tension,'' Doby said.
   The student council nullified last Thursday's voting because
some ballots were stolen by protesters.
   The new vote will take place next Thursday under heavy guard by
campus police, Doby said.
   Nearly 44 percent of the school's 23,000 undergraduates are
black, Hispanic or Asian, the highest level of minority enrollment
in campus history, Doby said.
   ``One might argue that our increased tension is an indication of
our success'' at bringing minorities into the student population,
Doby said.

   Americans will gather to remember the
greatest battle of the Civil War, where thousands of men in blue
and gray ``gave the last full measure of devotion'' 125 years ago
this summer.
   A 4{-month commemoration of the 125th anniversary of the Battle
of Gettysburg begins Monday with a Memorial Day parade and a
ceremony in the national cemetery.
   Gen. William Westmoreland, who commanded U.S. troops in Vietnam,
will speak at the cemetery services following the parade.
   Other highlights of the anniversary include a re-enactment of
key clashes in the three-day battle, set for June 24-26; a July 2
exchange of battle flags by governors of some states that
participated in the fighting; relighting of the Eternal Peace Light
Memorial on July 3; and re-creation of President Abraham Lincoln's
Gettysburg Address on the 125th anniversary of the speech, Nov. 19.
   National Park Service officials expect the events will draw
record-breaking crowds to the south-central Pennsylvania
battlefield, now a national park, where Union troops forced the
Confederate Army to retreat from northern soil after three days of
bitter, bloody fighting July 1-3, 1863.
   Many historians view the battle as the decisive event in the
war. In all, nearly 50,000 Union and Confederate troops were killed
or wounded after Gen. Robert E. Lee invaded the North.
   After clashing with Yankees at Harrisburg and Chambersburg,
Lee's troops met Union forces under Gen. George G. Meade west of
Gettysburg on July 1. The climax of the battle came July 3 when Lee
ordered Gen. George E. Pickett's division forward. ``Pickett's
Charge'' proved to be a disaster, and Lee withdrew.
   That November, Lincoln made his celebrated speech when he came
to Gettysburg to help dedicate the cemetery there.
   ``Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought fourth on
this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to
the proposition tha all men are created equal,'' Lincoln said.
   He called on his listeners to rededicate themselves to the cause
for which the soldiers gave their lives _ ``the last full measure
of devotion'' _ so that ``government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.''
   In an average year, 1.4 million visitors tour the battlefield.
This year, officials say, 2 million or more could come to town.
   ``It's going to be a little problem, but we've handled this
before,'' said Mayor Frank Linn.
   During the re-enactment, thousands of Civil War buffs will
participate in a scaled-down version of the fighting at a farm
outside of town. Park Service rules prohibit a re-enactment on the
actual battlefield.
   The peace light memorial that is to be rededicated July 3 was
dedicated in 1938 by President Franklin Roosevelt. Members of the
anniversary commission hope to relight a natural-gas flame that
burned at the monument until 1975, when rising oil prices prompted
federal officials to convert the flame to an electric light. Money
from private donors was raised to pay for the fuel and to repair
the gas lines.
   Astronomer Carl Sagan is scheduled to speak at the relighting
ceremony. President Reagan has also been invited, but has not yet
said if he will attend.
   U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist is scheduled to be keynote
speaker at the Gettysburg Address re-enactment in November. A man
dressed as Lincoln will re-create the actual speech.

<HEAD>World's Largest Marine Park Opens With A Splash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There were walruses and penguins and a
killer whale as Sea World of Texas, the world's largest marine
theme park, opened with a grand splash Saturday expected to make
water more financially attractive than oil.
   More than 50,000 people were expected to view the variety of
aquatic shows in the 250-acre, $140 million park, whose main
attraction is Shamu, the three-ton killer whale.
   The park took three years to plan and build and has been open
since mid-April to allow employees and animal trainers time to
acquaint themselves with their jobs.
   But for the grand opening Saturday, marching bands oompahed and
strutted as hundreds of colored balloons and a thousand doves were
released into the sky while four F-16 fighter jets flew overhead.
   ``Sea World of Texas is ready,'' park Chairman George Becker
said.
   ``We dedicate it to the children and families of this great
state. Our hope is that it will bring joy and education to millions
over the years.''
   San Antonio, the nation's ninth largest city, annually attracts
more than 10 million visitors who pump more than $1 billion into
the local economy..
   Sea World officials expect the park to attract another 3 million
visitors to San Antonio and Texas, which continues to struggle from
a skid in oil prices.
   Texas officials are putting more money into tourist marketing,
trying to attract vacationers to offset the loss in petroleum
dollars.
   Mayor Henry Cisneros, who was among local officials who helped
attract the park to the city in 1985, said it will be a drawing
card for tourists.
   Parking lots were full throughout the day, but there were
numerous empty seats at the shows as sightseers spent most of their
time getting acquainted with the park.
   Lori Madsen and her son, Nicholas, of Houston, traveled to San
Antonio for the grand opening.
   They saw Shamu splash his way around the 7-million-gallon,
40-foot tank.
   ``It's was great,'' Ms. Madsen said after the show. ``So far,
what we've seen of the park it is wonderful.''
   Shamu gave some park visitors an extra treat Saturday when he
stopped in the middle of his 30-minute show and stared at them for
about 7 minutes before finally getting on with the act.
   ``I'm not going to try to tell a six-thousand-pound killer whale
what to do,'' trainer Mark McHugh said. ``He can do what he wants
to do. We'll just sit it out and wait for him.''
   Mike Torigian, in the party with Ms. Madsen, said they would
return to the park later this summer.
   ``I think people are tired of AstroWorld and Six Flags,''
Torigian said, referring to the amusement parks in Houston and
Arlington.
   ``This is something different. I'm sure we'll be back again,''
he said. Dolphins, seals, penguins and walruses also perform in
other arenas and park employees perform a ski-show on a 12-acre
lake in the middle of the park.
   Sea World has other parks in San Diego, Cleveland and Orlando,
Fla.

   A small group of demonstrators appealed to

   The 11 women said they would carry out hunger strikes during
this week's superpower summit, a news agency said.
   A police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 18
women took part in the peaceful demonstration in the southern port
of Malmo.
   The national news agency TT quoted unidentified activists as
saying that some of the Soviet Jews had been applying for permits
to go to Israel since 1971.
   The agency said the activists had sent an appeal to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and told him that the 11 women planned
hunger strikes in Moscow and Leningrad during the Moscow summit,
which begins Sunday.
   TT said the activists also sent a copy of their letter to Reagan.

   Vice President George Bush spent Saturday planning how to depart
from some Reagan administration policies while preparing to attack
Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis for his performance as
governor of Massachusetts.
   ``The vice president is a man firmly committed to setting his
own agenda. I don't think there was any doubt about that at all,''
Illinois Gov. James Thompson said after two days of strategy
meetings at Bush's oceanside vacation retreat at Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who also met with Bush, said
that ``the domestic side is going to be one of the strong points of
the Bush campaign and the Bush presidency'' in contrast to what he
said were ``management failures of the Dukakis administration'' as
governor of Massachusetts.
   In response to Sununu's comments, Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach
cited the economic health of Massachusetts and added a jab of his
own: ``If there weren't jobs in Massachusetts for the people who
lived in New Hampshire, the New Hampshire unemployment rate would
practically triple.''
   On the vice president's agenda during private meetings at
Kennebunkport were the legal troubles of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III and the failed negotiations to force Panamanian ruler and
alleged drug trafficker Manuel Antonio Noriega from power.
   Meanwhile, Democrat Jesse Jackson, campaigning in a housing
project in Atlantic City, N.J., commissioned himself a ``general in
the war on drugs'' while bestowing lesser ranks on Dukakis and Bush.
   Although Bush opposed the administration's efforts to negotiate
a deal with Noriega, the issue remains campaign fodder for the
Democrats.
   ``Silence for sanctuary is sleaze,'' Jackson said of the Noriega
deal.
   ``Bush is fighting the war on drugs after seven years. He just
joined it,'' Jackson said. ``I'm the general in this war on drugs.
I've led this fight.''
   Jackson told a crowd of about 200 people at a housing project
plagued by drug problems and gang violence that Dukakis is a
captain in the war and Bush a lieutenant.
   Jackson is concentrating his Memorial Day weekend campaigning on
New Jersey, one of four states holding primaries on June 7. At
stake in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana are 466
delegates.
   Dukakis holds a commanding lead over Jackson in the latest
Associated Press tally with 1,711 delegates to Jackson's 984. To
nominate, 2,081 are needed.
   Thompson and Sununu were among the GOP officials urging Bush to
stake out his own territory on a number of issues apart from Reagan.
   But GOP advisers said there are limits to how far Bush can go in
distancing himself from Reagan since it was his close
identification with the popular president that helped him clinch
the Republican nomination. Bush locked up the 1,139 delegates
needed to nominate on April 26 with a win in the Pennsylvania
primary.
   Reagan, in a taped interview with Soviet journalists, said he
expects Bush, if elected, to continue the type of dialogue he has
established with the Kremlin leadership.
   ``If the next president is the president I would like to see
there, the present vice president, I know he would continue on this
track,'' Reagan said. ``And _ but I think that our people want
this.''
   The interview, conducted in Washington last week, was broadcast
in the Soviet Union on Saturday.
   In Boston, Dukakis traded jokes with comedians Robin Williams
and Billy Crystal as the two presented a $217,000 check for
homeless assistance to a Boston health care group.
   Handing the check to Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, Crystal
said: ``You'll need two forms of ID if you have them. But hold it
till Thursday.''
   The exchange took place at a Statehouse ceremony in which the
Boston Health Care for the Homeless Project received the check from
Comic Relief, a organizations formed by 80 comedians in 1986 which
has raised $4.7 million for the homeless in 23 cities nationwide.
   ``Speaking of comic relief, we had some yesterday,'' Dukakis
said.
   ``The vice president said his cholesterol level was going up. He
was angry and his cholesterol level was going up. I wonder what he
meant by that.''
   Dukakis got a laugh, but Crystal got a bigger one.
   ``Too much fat in the budget,'' he said.
   Dukakis had no comment on a 10-page letter circulated by a
Senate GOP leadership aide and a conservative political group that
said the Massachusetts governor is a ``pagan'' who uses his
membership in the Greek Orthodox Church ``as just a convenient
prop'' for political purposes.
   James Jatras, an aide to Sen. William L. Armstrong, R-Colo.,
said Saturday that he sent out the letter because Dukakis is
``campaigning around the country, presenting himself as an Orthodox
Christian in good standing.''
   ``He's simply not that. I want to make them aware of the facts.
He's misrepresenting his religion to people,'' Jatras said in a
telephone interview.
   The letter, also circulated in Greek communities by the Ad Hoc
Committee in Defense of Life, a New York-based anti-abortion group,
cites Dukakis' pro-choice stand on abortion and his ``marriage to a
non-Christian.'' His wife, Kitty Dukakis, is Jewish.
   Jatras, who is Greek Orthodox, said he conferred with a number
of Greek Orthodox bishops and priests, who share his view and have
written him in support.
   ``He is falsely presenting a religion not only to Orthodox
faithful but to the American public,'' Jatras said. ``I'm am asking
him to desist from this masquerade.
   ``There is no reason he has to adopt this phony identity for
political purposes,'' he said.

Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Norwegian relief group evacuated its
foreign personnel from south Lebanon ``for security reasons''
Saturday, one week after a Belgian volunteer disappeared.
   ``We cannot continue sending medical volunteers if they
disappear like Dr. Jan Cools,'' the Norwac group said in a
statement.
   The relief group did not say how many people were involved in
the evacuation.
   Cools, 32, has worked with Norwac for three months. He vanished
May 21 after leaving the Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp near
the southern city of Tyre.
   The statement said Cools was heading for a U.N. peacekeeping
force base in Tyre to pick up his mail when he disappeared.
   Police said they have no information about his disappearance,
and no one has claimed responsibility.
   However, Rashidiyeh administrators said Thursday that Cools had
been kidnapped by unidentified gunmen at a road junction near Tyre.
It gave no details.
   There are 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, missing in
Lebanon after being kidnapped. Most are believed held by Shiite
Moslem groups linked to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Delegates of Mauritius stormed out
of the final session of the Organization of African Unity summit
Saturday and accused the OAU of hypocrisy for criticizing their
nation's increased trade with South Africa.
   ``These self-righteous, hypocritical accusations are an insult
to Mauritius,'' said Satoam Boolall, the island nation's chief
representative at the summit. ``My government feels that it is
being unfairly and unjustly singled out.''
   Boolall, of Mauritius' Foreign Ministry, said Prime Minister
Aneerood Jugnauth ordered the delegation to walk out of the session.
   Conference sources said the Comoros Islands and the Seychelles,
two other Indian Ocean islands, also protested the summit's
adoption of an OAU Liberation Committee report expressing
embarrassment and concern at their growing trade ties with South
Africa.
   Thirty heads of state attended the OAU's 25th anniversary
celebrations and its 24th summit in Addis Ababa, the organization's
headquarters.
   OAU Secretary-General Ide Oumarou of Niger said the final
resolution criticized those African nations that do not border
South Africa and whose economic relationship with the
white-dominated government was ``voluntary and deliberate.''
   He said the organization was not being hypocritical in not
citing the countries whose geographical proximity to South African
and colonial heritages have forced their economies to be integrated
into that of South Africa.
   Black Africa does about $1 billion a year business with South
Africa, most of it covert. The summit established a committee to
investigate that.
   It also asked the OAU secretariat to report on the financial
cost of opening a Washington D.C. office to back efforts
encouraging passage of a U.S. bill supporting economic sanctions
against South Africa.
   The OAU member countries repeated longstanding calls for the
United States to use its influence with Pretoria to ensure the
speedy implementation of U.N. Resolution 435, calling for a
cease-fire and referendum in Namibia, which South Africa
administers.
   The summit also said it would work toward convening a U.N.
Security Concil meeting to ``examine the totality of racist South
Africa's reprehensive policies and acts of state terrorism in South
Africa, Namibia and the region.''
   The OAU discussed the $12 million owed by 34 member states to
the organization's fund for the support of liberation movements.
   A resolution urged that the members owing money, some of which
have never contributed, to clear their debts within two years ``to
enable national liberation movements to intensify the armed
struggle in Namibia and South Africa.''
   President Moussa Traore of Mali, newly-elected chairman of the
OAU, told reporters the pan-African body will continue to pursue
its call for a unified front of the African National Congress, the
main guerrilla movement fighting white domination in South Africa,
and the much smaller Pan Africanist Congress, which are fighting
South Africa's government.
   Under South Africa's system of apartheid, the nation's 26
million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate schools, districts
and health services.

   A French photographer held nine months
in an Afghan prison was freed Saturday and said police had debated
whether to formally arrest him or kill him and blame guerrillas who
brought him into the country.
   ``I wasn't treated too badly but I was morally brutalized,''
said Alain Guillo, 45. ``For the first four months, I had no
newspapers, books or paper. I was always under surveillance and
deprived of fundamental rights.''
   Guillo, who spoke to reporters after arriving in New Delhi, left
the Indian capital for Paris early Sunday. He was freed in Kabul
after Gilbert Perol, secretary-general of the French Foreign
Ministry, presented a letter from President Francois Mitterrand to
Afghan leader Najib.
   At the news conference in the home of Andre Lewin, the French
ambassador, Guillo said he had no advance word of his release.
   He said Afghan security police captured him Aug. 28 after he
sneaked into Afghanistan with Moslem insurgents. His arrest was not
announced until mid-September.
   ``For 15 days, they hesitated between killing me on the spot and
arresting me formally,'' he said. ``They would have blamed the
killing on the mujahedeen.''
   Afghan insurgents call themselves mujahedeen, or ``holy
warriors.'' They began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978, and Soviet military forces entered the country in December
1979.
   The Soviets, who had at least 100,000 soldiers in Afghanistan,
began withdrawing on May 15 under a U.N.-sponsored agreement, but
the guerrillas have continued fighting. They have bases in
Pakistan, Afghanistan's eastern neighbor, and the United States
supplies much of their support.
   Guillo said he would like to return to Afghanistan. When asked
whether he would go with rebels again he replied: ``That doesn't
really matter.''
   He said he thought he was released now because of the French
government's intervention and the superpower summit beginning
Sunday in Moscow.
   He is the sixth Frenchmen to be jailed in Afghanistan and then
pardoned and freed since the Soviet intervention. Guillo was
pardoned Wednesday night.
   A senior French official in Kabul said privately that no
conditions were attached to the release. ``There was no agreement,
no special considerations,'' he said.
   The photographer appeared relaxed, dressed in a blue striped
shirt and gray slacks. He was clean-shaven.
   Asked how he felt, Guillo said: ``Well, not too bad.''
   He said his trial Jan. 4 was ``pure comedy and a travesty of
justice.'' He was convicted of ``espionage and subversive
activities,'' which he denied, and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   At one point he was in a cell with 65 other people, most of them
Iranians and Pakistanis, Guillo said, but later he was shifted to
the Central Jail in the Afghan capital.
   Fausto Biloslavo, an Italian who worked for the small Albatross
New Agency, also is imprisoned in Kabul. He was captured in July
last year after entering the country from Pakistan with guerrillas
and convicted in March of espionage. He was sentenced to seven
years.
   ``I will do my utmost to get him freed,'' Guillo said.
   Western diplomatic sources in Kabul, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they expected Biloslavo to be released soon.
   In New Delhi, Guillo resumed his role as a photojournalist. He
accepted two rolls of film from an Indian photographer, containing
pictures of his arrival, to carry to Paris for processing.

   A band of Kurdish guerrillas mugged a group
of foreign climbers on Mount Ararat, burned their camping equipment
and stole their cameras and money, the Anatolia News Agency
reported Saturday.
   The agency said the climbers _ one from Belgium, one from West
Germany, and two from France _ were descending with three Turkish
guides after a climb to the 17,000-foot peak when they encountered
the assailants at an altitude of 10,500 feet.
   Budolf Richter, the Belgian, told the agency there were four,
heavily armed men.
   The government temporarily banned climbing the mountain two
years ago for security reasons following other such incidents.
   Most of the guerrillas operating in the region are linked to the
Kurdish Labor Party, which seeks to set up a Marxist state in parts
of eastern and southeastern Turkey.
   Nearly 900 civilians and military personnel and an equal number
of Kurdish insurgents have been killed since Kurdish guerrillas
started hit-and-run attacks in 1984.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of
52 million.

   Hungarian radio on Saturday reported
for the first time a protest by environmentalists, who gathered in
downtown Budapest to demonstrate against construction of a Danube
River power project.
   Such protests, which are not officially sanctioned, have taken
place before but have not been reported by the state-run media in
this Soviet bloc country.
   About 2,000 people assembled Friday and marched to the Austrian
Embassy to protest construction of the power plant near Nagymaros
on the Danube.
   The Nagymaros project is being developed in conjunction with a
similar plant at Gabcikovo across the border in Czechoslovakia.
   Austrian and Hungarian environmentalists and biologists have
warned that the two systems threaten drinking water reserves for
millions of Hungarians and destroy a large area of riverside
forestland, which serves as a wildlife habitat.
   Under an Austrian-Hungarian contract signed May 29, 1986, 70
percent of the $483 million construction work will be carried out
by an Austrian state-run electricity concern.
   A Danube power project near Hainburg east of Vienna was
discontinued by the Austrian government after police clubbed
protesters who marched to prevent the chopping down of trees on the
construction site.

<TEXT>
   More than 200 pregnant women may have unknowingly
taken a drug as part of a study conducted by two Cook County
Hospital physicians, the hospital's director says.
   The study was to determine if Dilantin, a common drug used to
treat epilepsy and stroke patients, could reduce fetal stress in
cases of Caesarean section births, said Terrence Hansen, the
hospital's director.
   About 245 pregnant women were given the drug by two
anesthesiologists between late September 1987 and Jan. 16, but an
initial review showed that just five of the women signed consent
forms to be part of the study, Hansen said late Friday.
   ``It is against hospital policies not to obtain the patients'
signed consent,'' Hansen said in a telephone interview. ``In this
case, they did not.''
   Hansen said he knew of no injuries caused by the administration
of the Dilantin, which he characterized as a common drug.
   ``The dosages were small,'' he said. ``It's very, very unlikely
... that there were side effects or detrimental effects.''
   Hansen declined to identify the two doctors, but said the
recommended punishment was probation, a warning that could lead to
disciplinary measures by the hospital if the doctors commit further
policy violations.
   He said two babies born to the 245 mothers died, but he said
both deaths resulted from complications because of ``significant
prematurity.'' He said autopsies performed ruled out a link to the
Dilantin.
   The hospital is run by the county and is on the city's
economically depressed West Side.
   The study was approved by a hospital physicians' committee in
September, but after a routine review of the research, the issue of
the consent forms was raised, according to Hansen.
   The hospital's Executive Medical Staff, a group of about 35
doctors, last week recommended one year of probation for the two
doctors involved, Hansen said.
   The final word on what punishment, if any, will be applied is up
to the Cook County Board, which acts as the hospital's board of
trustees, Hansen said. The board next meets June 6, he said.
   The drug most likely would have been administered intravenously,
he said.
   Hansen could not say if all of the women who were given the drug
were candidates for Caesarean section births. He said hospital
officials were conducting their own review of patient records in
the case.
   Hansen also said he did not know the status of the research.

   Police said they raided a Mafia summit
Saturday and arrested five people meeting to draw up new
territories for Naples' crime families.
   The five were charged with criminal association of a Mafia type
and with illegal possession of firearms. They are reputed leaders
of the Camorra, the Neapolitan version of the Mafia.
   Authorities said the five met at the apartment of the boss of
one Camorra gang and that the apartment had been under surveillance
for months.
   The five were identified as Antonio Egizio, 35; his brother
Umberto Egizio, 24; Vincenzo Romano, 28; Vincenzo de Michele, 36;
and Salvatore Manna, 44. Police said Antonio Egizio recently sent a
letter to President Francesco Cossiga complaining that he was a
good person who was continously being persecuted, stopped and
followed by the police.

mapping new strategy; EDITS to tighten. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   George Bush will part company with
President Reagan on a variety of domestic issues in a campaign that
will also portray Democrat Michael Dukakis' management record as a
failed one, two Republican governors said Saturday.
   Govs. John Sununu of New Hampshire and James Thompson of
Illinois told reporters that Bush was working to develop a package
of new proposals on child care, the homeless, housing, education
and drug education.
   ``The vice president is a man firmly committed to setting his
own agenda. I don't think there was any doubt about that at all,''
Thompson said after two days of strategy meetings at Bush's
oceanside vacation retreat.
   Bush is meeting with Republican leaders and advisers during his
weeklong stay.
   Sununu said that ``the domestic side is going to be one of the
strong points of the Bush campaign and the Bush presidency'' in
contrast to what he said were ``management failures of the Dukakis
administration'' as governor of Massachusetts.
   Responding to Sununu's comments, Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach
said: ``If there weren't jobs in Massachusetts for the people who
lived in New Hampshire, the New Hampshire unemployment rate would
practically triple.''
   Dach said the Dukakis campaign would be happy to debate the
governor's economic record ``because when we do it reminds voters
that Mike Dukakis has a record of innovative accomplishments for
people and George Bush has seven years of silence on critical
domestic issues.''
   Sununu's comments signaled an apparent decision by Bush campaign
strategists to take on Dukakis directly on domestic policy issues,
usually considered his strong suit.
   Sununu cited ``an inability to handle the budget'' and alleged
failure of Dukakis to modernize the state's prison facilities or do
a better job in processing welfare payments for families with
dependent children.
   He also claimed the Dukakis administration had failed to project
future state spending levels carefully, raising prospects of
``hundreds of millions of dollar deficits'' if there is an economic
downturn.
   Sununu, a longtime Bush supporter, said that the vice
president's campaign would seek in the months ahead to show voters
``the difference of the reality of what (Dukakis) has done versus
the perception.''
   Thompson said that during the strategy session, Bush was given
guidence on ``what works and what doesn't work in the real world.''
   ``The bottom line is that George Bush wants to make the nation
work,'' Thompson said.
   Republican leaders have been urging Bush to put distance between
himself and Reagan, and Bush has been striking out in recent days
in an effort to do just that.
   Thompson and other participants at the weekend strategy and
issues sessions had few details of what the new Bush domestic
programs would contain. Thompson said they would be unveiled at the
appropriate time.
   During the meetings, Bush and his campaign aides also discussed
the problems of embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III and the
fallout over failed negotiations with Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   The troubles still hound Bush, as recent polls indicated that
likely Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis held a double-digit lead
over the vice president. Bush shrugs off the polling data, claiming
he likes being able to fight back as an underdog, but the results
have top campaign strategists worried.
   ``I've never been in a campaign when I wouldn't rather be ahead
than behind,'' says Bush pollster Robert Teeter.
   Meanwhile, an aide to Bush declined to comment on a report in
Saturday's editions of The Washington Post that Bush met privately
with Meese earlier this month to discuss political ramifications of
the attorney general's ongoing legal problems.
   Citing unidentified sources, the newspaper said it could not be
learned what Bush told Meese.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., one of those invited to meet with Bush
in Maine, said a healthy economy and a diminished Soviet threat
have given social issues more importance in this year's
presidential campaign _ posing a problem not only to Bush but for
all Republicans.
   Democrats are generally identified with being more concerned
than Republicans on social issues, she said.
   ``The fact is, we're moving into the 1990s. Issues like day
care, which were not issues in 1980, are issues today when we see
50 percent of the women with children under three working. So you
don't have to move away from Ronald Reagan. You're just moving into
a new era,'' Ms. Martin said.
   It wasn't all work for the vice president. He has been taking
guests out for short rides in the Atlantic Ocean on his power boat,
``Fidelity.'' And on Monday, he planned to march in the annual
Kennebunkport Memorial Day parade.

<TEXT>
   The ousted president, Eric Arturo
Delvalle, waits in hiding to resume his job with Washington's
blessing, but the general who had him dismissed has stared down the
Colossus of the North and won't let go.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle but apparently did
not push for his restoration to power in talks with Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, head of the military and de facto leader of
Panama. Those discussions on an arrangement for Noriega to step
down collapsed last week.
   Opposition groups have conducted low-key demonstrations
demanding that Noriega go, but little public sentiment has been
expressed about Delvalle.
   Delvalle himself, in a rare meeting with foreign journalists
last week, said there is no reason for him to surrender his claim
to the presidency.
   ``Why should I?'' he replied when asked if there were
circumstances under which he might abandon it.
   ``This is one of the basic factors: respect for the constitution
by the military,'' he said. ``All over Latin America there has been
a clear, loud message that (the military) are below civilian
government.
   ``Under no circumstances should it be considered that I resign
as president of the republic ... to satisfy the pride of Gen.
Noriega,'' he added.
   Delvalle tried to dismiss Noriega on Feb. 25 as commander of
Panama's army and police. The next day, Noriega supporters in the
National Assembly voted to dismiss Delvalle.
   U.S. federal courts indicted Noriega on drug trafficking charges
in July and Washington has imposed economic sanctions on Panama in
an attempt to oust him.
   More negotiations _ discussions, as the general calls them _ are
likely, this time with Latin American democracies taking part, and
other opposition leaders question whether they can or should go to
the mat for Delvalle.
   ``I believe all Panamanians who want a democracy must be willing
to contribute to the fight and to sacrifice positions when the
moment arrives,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon, head of Panama's
Christian Democrat Party. ``This applies to all.''
   He and other opposition figures advocate a government of
``national conciliation'' that would bring various sectors together.
   Guillermo Endara of the largest opposition party, the Authentic
Panamenists, said Delvalle ``is probably not the person to solve
the Panamanian crisis at this time.''
   He said Delvalle, who comes from the small, business-oriented
Republican Party, does not have a broad base.
   Panamanian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Delvalle two
months ago but has made no evident effort to find him.
   Delvalle told journalists he has not left Panama since he went
into hiding shortly after he his dismissal, and denied living in
any embassy or on a military base. The United States maintains
military installations along the Panama Canal.
   Some members of his family stay at the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Arthur Davis, but embassy officials say Delvalle is not.
   The military seems adamant that Manuel Solis Palma, who replaced
Delvalle, remain as president. A tentative deal between the United
States and Noriega's negotiators was turned down because it did not
guarantee that he would remain in office.

   Gunmen believed to be Sinhalese
nationalists burst into the home of an opposition party candidate
Saturday and fatally shot the candidate and two supporters, police
said.
   Indian troops meanwhile conducted sweeps of jungle areas in
northeastern Sri Lanka on Saturday, the sixth day of an offensive
aimed at wiping out Tamil rebel bases in the area.
   An Indian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at
least 36 Tamil rebels were killed and 45 injured since the
offensive began near the port of Mullaitivu on Monday. Three rebel
bases have been overrun by the 6,000 Indian troops involved in the
operation, the official said.
   Police said S.B. Yalagama, 58, a member of the opposition United
Socialist Alliance, and two campaign workers were meeting at the
politician's residence when three men broke in and opened fire.
   Yalagama, a candidate in the provincial elections scheduled for
June 9, lived in the town of Natala, 65 miles northeast of Colombo.
   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, blamed the
killing on the People's Liberation Front, an extremist group of
Sinhalese nationalists. The group has vowed to block the voting.
   The elections are the second to be held under the
Indian-sponsored peace accord signed July 29 to try to end the
Tamil rebel insurgency in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   The extremists, who have been blamed for the deaths of 290
people since then, have vowed to kill anyone supporting the pact,
claiming that it makes too many concessions to the minority Tamils.
   India's military drive against the Tamils is the strongest since
October, when Indian troops launched a 10-day offensive to drive
the rebels out of the Jaffna Peninsula in the north.
   The Indian High Commission, or embassy, said 10 Indian soldiers
were killed and 21 injured since Monday. But the rebels have said
they killed 25 Indian soldiers and lost one of their men.
   The conflicting claims could not be independently verified
because communications have been cut off with Mullativu, 175 miles
northeast of Colombo.
   India has sent more than 50,000 troops to the island to enforce
the accord, which called on Tamil rebels to lay down their arms in
exchange for the creation of district councils to give people more
say in local government affairs.
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest of the rebel
groups, rejected the pact and has continued its rebellion.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. They claim they are discriminated against by the
Sinhalese Buddhists, who make up about 75 percent of the population.

<HEAD>Knife-Wielding Girl Gangs Enter The Domain Once Reserved For Men</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Girls have moved from the sidelines to the front
lines of the city's gangs, adding a twist to the warfare that used
to be a male domain, an official said Saturday.
   Traditionally, young women stayed on the fringes of male gangs,
concealing weapons and narcotics for their gang-member boyfriends,
said Robert Martin, executive director of Chicago Intervention
Network, a city agency charged with reducing gang violence.
   But now there are seven to nine independent female gangs in the
city, most of which have cropped up in the last six months, Martin
said in a telephone interview.
   ``They have names, identity, membership and codes _ all that is
used to keep the group together and promote a certain direction,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   ``There's a trend for the girls to carry something called a
carpet knife _ a razor used to cut carpet professionally _ and they
carry it around as their weapon of choice,'' he said.
   Like their male counterparts, the young women may have joined
the groups for a feeling of belonging, Martin said, but the gangs
have evolved into hubs for stealing, purse snatching and violence.
Most violent acts are in retaliation for harm done to a gang
member, he added.
   There are no figures yet on how many young women are involved in
these new gangs, Martin said. The city estimates there are about
15,000 male gang members.
   The female gangs tend to be less organized than their male
counterparts, and so far ``most of them have not come to the
sophistication of selling drugs,'' Martin said.
   ``But it's (girl gang activity) escalating because you have
older people orchestrating it and showing them they can make more
money as a gang than individually,'' he said.
   Martin said the girl gangs have sprung up because of a decline
in social services, a liberation of the role of women, an increase
in drug use by women and the deterioration of the family structure.
   ``Females now feel free to go after the same kinds of things
that males go after _ money, recognition, status, even the mate
they want,'' he said.
   ``A greater number of girls are out on the street unsupervised
looking for something, and the gang gives it to them,'' Martin said.
   The Chicago Police Department has no statistics on the
membership of girl gangs, but females under 20 are responsible for
an increasing number of serious crimes, the Chicago Sun-Times
reported in early editions of Sunday's newspaper.
   They accounted for 14 murders in 1987, up from 12 the year
before. Females under 20 also were responsible for 2,229 assaults,
up from 1,789 the year before, the Sun Times reported.
   ``We have a number of females unsupervised on the streets and if
we sleep on that we'll see the women gangs become more organized
and developed as the male gangs,'' Martin said.
   Martin said the government no longer provides adequate funding
for programs for youth, ``so the gang structure has stepped in to
provide some of those services,'' Martin said.
   ``I believe its a culmination of things: females are seeing
males their own age with money, being part of a group, seemingly
being confident and having fun, and they're going after it too,''
he said. ``But once you're in a gang, the nightmare begins.''
   The Chicago Intervention Network is sponsoring a first-ever
conference for young women Friday, modeled after an all-day seminar
in December for some 500 boys belonging to an estimated 18 rival
gang factions in Chicago.
   About 300 teen-age girls are expected to attend workshops on the
risks of joining gangs and alternative social activities, pregnancy
prevention and careers.

<HEAD>Leaders Say INF Scrutiny Shows Senate Will Carefully Scrutinize
Arms Pacts</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Inserts 3 grafs after 3rd graf bgng: ``The Senate ... to

The INF pact ...</NOTE>

   The Senate's work on the medium-range missile
treaty shows that lawmakers will carefully scrutinize any arms pact
and not be just a rubber stamp for the president, say the chamber's
leaders.
   That theme was heard often during the two weeks of floor debate
on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, ratified
Friday by a 93-5 vote, and is likely to continue for any future
arms agreements.
   ``The Senate has clearly made visible that it is an equal
partner with any president in the making of treaties,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. ``And I hope that will be a
sobering impact on this president and Mr. Gorbachev when they sit
down and discuss another agreement.''
   White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr., who left with
the treaty Saturday to join President Reagan in Helsinki, said the
ratified pact indicated a ``new spirit of bipartisan cooperation''
between the president and Congress.
   ``The president, I believe, has shown his dedication to peace,
his dedication to strength, his dedication to see he leaves a
legacy of a better world and a safer world at the end of his eight
years as president,'' Baker told reporters at Andrews Air Force
Base.
   There will be a ceremonial exchange of the treaty documents in
Moscow on Wednesday, and Baker said the exchange signaled ``a
historic improvement of the relationship of the two superpowers of
the world.''
   The INF pact ``in a lot of ways, was a stalking horse for
START,'' said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, referring to the
proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   Both Cohen and Byrd noted that the INF was closely scrutinized
by three different committees. If the Senate learned anything from
its work on the treaty, Byrd said, ``it is that we have to ask a
lot of questions, that we have to look very closely.''
   ``We were very deliberative, we were very thorough and I believe
that we have improved this treaty,'' said Byrd. ``I think we've
closed all the loopholes we know about in this treaty and it's a
much better treaty than when it was sent'' to Capitol Hill.
   Byrd had pulled the INF treaty off the Senate's calendar due to
questions that were raised about whether the Soviet Union intended
to comply with all verification provisions.
   ``I resisted the pressure to bring up this treaty until the
faults could be corrected,'' said Byrd. ``The administration's
negotiators went back to Geneva and corrected those faults. It is
now a better treaty than it ever was before.''
   Cohen agreed, noting, ``I think that in some ways, we improved
the treaty. We tied down some loose ends that perhaps could have
caused trouble if we hadn't cleared them up.''
   But, Cohen asked, ``if we had this much debate and trouble on a
treaty like INF, just imagine what would happen if we get a START
treaty.''
   He noted that the INF pact was relatively straightforward and
involved only a small percentage of each superpower's atomic
arsenal. By contrast, a START agreement would reduce arsenals by 50
percent and would require far more extensive verification
provisions. It would thus permit far more opportunities to cheat.
   The biggest fight over the INF pact stemmed from a fight between
President Reagan and the Democratic-controlled Congress over the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   Reagan asserts that his administration has the legal authority
to change the U.S. interpretation of the 1972 pact, a move that
would permit expanded tests of Reagan's Star Wars anti-missile
system. Congressional Democrats dispute that claim.
   The Senate approved an amendment to the INF ratification
resolution banning any future president from re-intepreting the
pact unless Congress first approves.
   ``What we learned from that is that you have to be very careful,
you have to be very sure, when you ratify a treaty,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a chief
critic of the proposed change in the ABM pact.
   Byrd said the anti-interpretation amendment is ``a clear signal
to the administration, future administrations and the Soviets ...
that this Senate will not roll over and play dead ... and is not a
rubber stamp to any president.''
   But the suggestion that the Senate was an equal partner with the
president in the making of treaties brought a different response
from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
   ``This is one of the most serious constitutional issues to come
before this body in a long time ... we are trampling on the
Constitution,'' he said.
   Reagan submitted the INF pact to the Senate on Jan. 25,
beginning an exhaustive review of the treaty by the Foreign
Relations, Armed Services and Intelligence committee.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the scrutiny
provided a ``model of how we should perform our role to advise and
consent to treaties. I think this the most closely examined arms
control treaty in history.''
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a critic of the INF pact,
continually decried what he termed ``this rush to judgment.''
   The INF pact was on the Senate floor for nine days, a far
shorter time than previous treaties, Helms noted.
   ``I think that any future treaty should be examined much more
closely, in much greater detail, than we have done with this
treaty. Our work here may well come back to haunt us,'' he said.

   It was a sunny day in most of the land as Memorial Day weekend
got rolling Saturday, and thoughts of barbecue, lazy days at the
beach and the roar of engines at Indy captivated millions.
   The nation also prepared to honor those who fell in battle, from
the Revolutionary War to the present day, with parades, speeches
and tears.
   Highway police, ticket books in hand, braced for legions of
travelers in an effort to scare off speeders and drunken drivers.
   In New Jersey, the National Guard had to spread its officers,
bands and color guards thin, a spokesman said.
   ``There have to be around 30 different parades around the state
that we have been asked to participate in,'' said Capt. John
Guarascio. ``It's the greatest number of requests in many years.
The sense of patriotism and feeling for veterans is definitely at a
very high point.''
   The Memorial Day weekend also is the unofficial start of summer,
but don't tell the folks in the mountains of northern California.
Winter storm watches were posted there Saturday, with wind gusts as
high as 60 mph in the Sierra passes.
   Southern California beaches were less crowded than on a usual
holiday weekend as a dismal layer of clouds blanketed the region.
   ``We've got 40-50,000 here at this time,'' said lifeguard Ralph
Lee at the vast Santa Monica beach, which has been known to
accommodate 100,000 people. ``We've got overcast skies, which is
keeping the crowds down just a little bit.''
   More summery weather prevailed elsewhere. In Seaside Heights,
N.J., beach officials estimated that 20,000 people were on the sand
by noon Saturday.
   ``All the beaches are filled. It's a zoo. The place is mobbed,''
said police dispatcher Randolph Jenkins in Yarmouth, Mass., on Cape
Cod.
   Farther north, traffic on the Maine Turnpike surged Friday
afternoon and campgrounds, beaches, motels and restaurants prepared
for the first wave of summer vacationers. On Saturday, the
temperature at Portland, Maine, hit 89 degrees, breaking a
29-year-old record for the date by one degree.
   ``It's going to be a winner, and I think a lot of it has to do
with the sun showing up,'' said Carl Sanford, vice president of the
Maine Restaurant Association.
   The National Safety Council estimated that the long weekend
would claim 380 to 480 lives on the nation's highways. Last year,
416 people died, the Chicago-based council said. A non-holiday,
three-day weekend this time of year would probably see about 390
deaths.
   ``This is the most dangerous holiday weekend on rural roads
around the state,'' said Brian Ellison of the South Carolina
Department of Highways and Public Transportation. ``Everybody who
is available will be out'' patrolling, he said.
   In Philadelphia, activities kicked off early when a crowd
gathered near Independence Hall on Friday to pay tribute to the
thousands of Revolutionary War soldiers who lie in unmarked graves.
   ``It's great to come to remember and honor our country and the
men who died to create it,'' said David West, 11, at the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier of the American Revolution. ``May their souls
rest in peace.''
   In Norfolk, Va., families gathered in the rain Saturday to
remember 99 men who died 20 years ago when the submarine Scorpion
sank while coming home from the Mediterranean.
   More than 600 veterans and their families gathered Saturday at
the New Jersey Veterans Cemetery in North Hanover. An Army band
from Fort Dix played ``Amazing Grace'' as representatives of 16
veterans groups laid wreaths at a flag in the cemetery, where
nearly 1,500 veterans are buried.
   In Gettysburg, Pa., where nearly 50,000 soldiers were killed or
wounded during the Civil War, the 121st Memorial Day parade Monday
will be the start of a summerlong celebration of the 125th
anniversary of the battle, often called the turning point of the
war.
   Not all of the weekend's festivities were so serious. In
Somerset, Pa., sheep shearing is to be the highlight of the Fiber
Festival on Sunday, while in Pittsburgh, the Ashley Whippet
Invitational Dog Frisbee Contest was scheduled.
   In Indianapolis the main event is, of course, the 72nd running
of the Indianapolis 500 Sunday at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
Garfield the cat and his Hoosier creator, Jim Davis, were grand
marshals for the 500 Festival Memorial Parade in downtown
Indianapolis on Saturday.
   In Atlantic City, a traditional symbolic ``unlocking of the
ocean'' for the summer season will be held Monday, followed by a
Memorial Day parade on the Boardwalk.
   In Beaufort, S.C., the third annual Gullah Festival was under
way this weekend, an event that celebrates the Gullah culture and
language, a blend of English and West African tongues, of South
Carolina's sea islands.
   A wider variety of cultures are respresented at the annual
Folklife Festival at the Seattle Center, site of the 1962 World's
Fair, a potpourri of music, dance, artisanry and food from the
Pacific Northwest and elsewhere.
   An estimated 4,000 people ate Cajun food and listened to jazz
and blues on Saturday at the Jambalaya Jam at Penn's Landing in
Philadelphia. Also planned are hot air balloon races, a barrel
drop, horse racing and fireworks.
   Ex-Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North delivered a speech at the
Pennsylvania Fair in suburban Philadelphia, his first stop on a
national speaking tour. His topic: ``Commitment, Trust and Family.''

   Sunny skies and warm temperatures prevailed in much of the
country at the start of the Memorial Day weekend Saturday, but a
cold front ushered cool, wet weather into the northern Pacific
Coast region.
   The front brought showers and locally heavy rain into the area,
with temperatures in the upper 40s and 50s, and is expected to
spread cool, wet and windy weather into Western states over the
next couple of days, with snow expected at some higher elevations
of the mountains of northern California.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed in central Kansas and the
Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota. Thunderstorms in
southeastern North Dakota dropped 1.75 inches of rain in an hour
around Edgeley early Saturday.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed across southern
Colorado and northern New Mexico, in southern Florida, in eastern
North Carolina and in southeastern Virginia.
   Sunny skies prevailed across much of the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were in the 80s across most central and eastern
states, with readings approaching the 90-degree mark as far north
as Maine and North Dakota. Portland, Maine, set a record high for
the day of 89 degrees.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 46 degrees at Klamath
Falls, Ore., to 94 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.
   Sunday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in
southern and central Florida, and widely scattered storms in the
Great Plains. Showers and a few thunderstorms also were predicted
from the central and northern Pacific Coast to the central and
northern Plateau, with snow in some of the higher elevations. Fair
to partly sunny skies will prevail elsewhere, with strong and gusty
winds from the Southwest to Colorado and Wyoming.
   Highs were forecast to be in the upper 50s and 60s from the
central and northern Pacific Coast to the central and northern
Plateau, and along the southern Pacific Coast; in the 70s in New
England and the Great Lakes; and above 80 degrees elsewhere east of
the Rockies, with lower 90s in the north-central states. Highs also
were expected to be in the 80s and 90s in the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Armenians Take to Streets to Demand Freedom of Jailed Activist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Armenians rallied in their southern
capital Saturday, demanding freedom for a jailed nationalist leader
and calling for a holiday marking formation of their republic, a
Soviet dissident said.
   Alexander Ogorodnikov, a Russian Orthodox activist in Moscow,
said the crowd in Yerevan, near the Turkish border, sang patriotic
songs and held up portraits of Armenian national heroes and
Armenia's national flag. They also held pictures of Paruyr
Ayrikyan, a nationalist arrested in March and still under
confinement.
   Police did not interfere in the two-hour demonstration though
the crowd prevented government officials from speaking to the rally
through megaphones, the activist said without elaborating.
   Ayrikyan emerged as a primary spokesman for activists shortly
after Armenians began demonstrating Feb. 13 for annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh from neighboring Azerbaijan, a Soviet republic on
the Caspian Sea that borders with Iran.
   Ogorodnikov said Saturday's protest drew and estimated 50,000
people and occurred on the same square outside Yerevan's Opera
House where massive protests over the Nagorno-Karabakh issue have
been held.
   Portraits of Ayrikyan and the Armenian national flag were placed
on the Opera House, said Ogorodnikov, who spent nearly nine years
in jail for Christian activism.
   In addition to demanding the release of Ayrikyan, the
demonstrators called on the government to celebrate the May 28,
1918, formation of the Armenian Republic with a holiday. The
Armenian Republic later was incorporated into the Soviet Union.
   The protesters sent telegrams to the Soviet parliaments, known
as Supreme Soviets, in Moscow and Armenia outlining their demands,
Ogorodnikov said.
   Ayrikyan, 38, was leader of an underground Armenian nationalist
group called the National Unification Party and was jailed for 17
years beginning in 1969 for his political activities. Before his
late March arrest, he said he was chairman of a group called the
Alliance for National Self-Determination.
   Ayrikyan is being held in Armenia on a charge of defamation or
spreading false information discrediting the Soviet Union.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has been part of the mainly Moslem Azerbaijan
republic since 1923, although more than three-quarters of the
region's 160,000 residents are Armenians, who are predominantly
Christian.
   The annexation issue caused ethnic rioting for three days
beginning Feb. 28 in Sumgait in Azerbaijan. Thirty-two people were
killed.

   An earthquake jostled part of southern
Nevada early Saturday but there were no reports of damage or
injuries, authorities said.
   The quake, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale and centered five
miles southwest of Boulder City, struck at 3:51 a.m., said John
Minsch of the U.S. Geological Survey's earthquake information
center in Golden, Colo.
   ``We had reports that it was felt in the Boulder City area, but
no reports of any damage,'' Minsch said. Boulder City is a town of
9,600 about 10 miles southeast of Las Vegas.
   The quake struck an area that has experienced several small
temblors in the past six months, he said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake measuring 3.5 on the scale is capable of
slight damage.

   Shamu, a three-ton killer whale that
is the main attraction of the new Sea World of Texas, showed his
animal trainers who really was the boss in the water Saturday.
   Shamu splashed his way around his 7-million-gallon tank,
frequently pushing water out of the tank onto spectators.
   But halfway through a lap around the pool, the killer whale
stopped and stared at the crowd through the glass tank.
   Trainers Laura Perkins and Mark McHugh decided to let him stop
and stare after the killer whale ignored several instructions to go
on with the show.
   ``I'm not going to try to tell a six-thousand-pound killer whale
what to do,'' McHugh said. ``He can do what he wants to do. We'll
just sit it out and wait for him.''
   They said the killer whale liked to play games with the
trainers, but that eventually it has to come up for air.
   After about seven minutes under water, Shamu decided he was
ready to play again. He gave his trainers a signal that he was
ready to proceed and went on with the rest of the 30-minute act.

   Hughes Aircraft is under investigation
because of allegations that it reaped millions of dollars in
improper profits on a 1983 TOW missile contract with the Army, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   A federal grand jury in Birmingham, Ala., has subpoenaed 13
officials of the General Motors subsidiary since February along
with Executive Vice President D. Kenneth Richardson, who is to
testify soon, an unidentified company spokesman told the Los
Angeles Times.
   At least seven federal employees have appeared before the jury,
and recently appointed Hughes president Malcolm R. Currie was
interviewed by the U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham, the
newspaper reported.
   Currie was in charge of Hughes Missile Systems Group in Los
Angeles in 1983.
   The spokesman for the firm said the company denies any
wrongdoing involving the $120 million contract, which covered
production in 1983 and 1984.
   At issue is whether Hughes negotiated the deal without telling
the Army it anticipated cutting costs by transferring production of
missile wiring systems from a plant in Tucson, Ariz., to one in
Eufaula, Ala.
   If Hughes did anticipate the reduction and failed to tell the
Army, there may be a violation of the federal Truth in Negotiation
Act, the Times said.
   Often, defense contractors must surrender part of their profits
if production costs are lower than those anticipated in their

   Hughes has built more than 400,000 of the TOW missiles. They are
tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided missiles, which are
designed to attack armored vehicles.
   Earlier this month, it was disclosed that another federal grand
jury is investigating whether Hughes consultants in South America
diverted some of their fees to a customer in connection with
satellite sales.

<HEAD>Writers and Producers Off for Memorial Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Both sides in the 12-week-old scriptwriters
strike took a break for the Memorial Day holiday Saturday with no
hint that the signing of contracts by dozens of independent
producers would hasten an agreement.
   Formal negotiations were scheduled to resume Tuesday between the
striking Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers, under a federal mediator.
   By Friday, 73 companies had signed independent contracts with
the union, including the makers of such popular television shows as
``The Cosby Show,'' ``ALF,'' ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny
Carson'' and ``Highway to Heaven.''
   The producer of ``Late Night With David Letterman'' agreed to a
contract but had not yet signed, Cheryl Rhoden, spokeswoman for the
9,000-member union, said Saturday.
   The contracts, ratified by guild members Thursday, will put 200
to 400 writers back to work, according to union estimates.
   The three-year contracts grant the writers' key demand:
retention of the present formula for the residual payments that
writers get for syndication of one-hour television shows.
   Union officials claimed the independent contracts split
management ranks, but Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg said no
major company has settled with the writers.
   Many of those who did settle were one-person writer-producer
companies, including some that produce TV shows that have been
canceled, such as the Smothers Brothers' new comedy show, he said.
   ``Highway to Heaven'' star Michael Landon said he was glad
workers at his Michael Landon Productions would be back on the job.
``They have all been innocent victims and now they can all get back
to work,'' he said.

   Two convoys of Israeli peace activists drove
through the West Bank on Saturday to protest government policy in
the occupied territories, and Arabs in a Gaza Strip refugee camp
stoned the army headquarters.
   Three firebombs were hurled at an Arab's house Saturday in the
West Bank town of Ramallah and he opened fire, apparently wounding
one attacker, Israel radio reported. The army had no comment, but
Arab reports said the Palestinian was suspected of collaborating
with Israeli authorities.
   The army said it will launch a new probe into allegations by
some residents of Arura, also on the West Bank, that Israeli troops
tortured people when they raided the village earlier this month.
   A senior military official said the army was scheduled to reopen
secondary schools in the West Bank on Sunday, affecting about
70,000 Palestinian students. Kindergartens and elementary schools
were opened Monday last week after being closed nearly four months.
   Thousands of activists of the left-wing Peace Now movement drove
through the West Bank in two convoys of about 400 vehicles each.
They approached Nablus, the largest town, and later staged a
symbolic withdrawal from the occupied territory.
   Some Jewish settlers who encountered the convoys shouted insults
and several Arabs waved in support.
   Participants also held a rally south of Nablus during which
speakers criticized Jewish settlers in the occupied lands and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whom they blamed for army tactics
of shooting and beating.
   They also urged Arabs to abandon violence and begin peace
negotiations with Israel, the state radio said.
   In Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, home to 53,000 Palestinians,
young Arabs threw stones and bottles at the army headquarters and
soldiers responded with tear gas grenades and rubber bullets, said
an Arab journalist speaking on condition of anonymity. No injuries
were reported.
   Several Palestinians were ordered to park their vehicles in
front of the army headquarters to prevent more attacks, he said.
   In the Shati refugee camp, the army ordered a curfew requiring
people to stay at home, and a commercial strike paralyzed Gaza
City. Young Palestinians stoned stoned cars and set tires ablaze.
   The protests occurred the day after a 3-year-old Palestinian
girl died in Gaza City. Relatives said she died of tear gas
inhalation after Israeli soldiers threw tear gas grenades, but
hospital officials said the army confirmed the death without giving
a cause.
   At least 198 Arabs have been killed since violence began Dec. 8
among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish settler also have been slain.
   Some residents of Arura complained to authorities about being
stoned, beaten and burned with cigarettes when troops raided the
village north of Ramallah on May 18.
   Villagers told Associated Press reporter Karin Laub earlier this
week that the raid on Arura, which its 2,000 residents have
declared ``liberated,'' started at 5 a.m. with 40 to 50 army
vehicles, two helicopters and a gravel-firing device.
   Mohammed Awad, 23, who had a swollen ankle, handcuffs marks on
his wrists and a blue mark on his right eye, said he was captured
by Israeli troops and ordered to sit in a hilltop stone pit.
   He said Hassan Salah, 22, and Mohammed Zeid, 29, were forced to
sit in similar six-foot-deep pits nearby.
   ``There were about 20 to 25 soldiers who threw stones at me and
the others,'' Awad said. ``It went on for two hours.''
   Awad said he was then taken with 12 other detainees to Ramallah
prison, and on the way soldiers threw burning cigarettes on them.
He said troops extinquished cigarettes on Bilal Mahmoud, 19.
   Daoud Suleiman Farradni, a Ramallah Hospital doctor who lives in
the village, said he examined Mahmoud after the event and found
eight to ten cigarette burns on his chest and ankles.
   On Awad, the doctor said:
   ``His face was swollen and covered with bruises. There were also
bruises and swelling on his waist and legs, either from stones or
clubs.''
   Earlier this week, the military command said ``an initial
investigation was made at the site and no evidence was found to
support the allegations.'' On Saturday, the army said it will
launch another probe.
   A senior official at the military administration said the army
was scheduled to open secondary schools, which cover grades 6-9, on
Sunday and high schools will open June 6.
   At the height of the rebellion in February, the military
government closed 1,200 schools in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
shutting out more than 300,000 students. Schools in Gaza have
operated on-and-off since.
   Schools had been major centers of protest in the first two
months of the uprising.
   Underground leaders of the 6-month-old Palestinian rebellion
issued a new leaflet calling for a general strike Monday and a
strike June 3-6 to protest the expected visit of U.S. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz.

   Fawn Hall fended off a lawyer's questions
for two hours Saturday as part of a lawsuit in which a liberal
policy group has charged that several Iran-Contra figures were
involved in drug dealing.
   In a testy session, the former secretary to fired National
Security Council aide Oliver North delivered a deposition in which
she denied knowing several people involved in the suit. She was
accompanied by her lawyer, Plato Cacheris.
   Ms. Hall, who is not a defendant in the case, also denied
knowing about or said she had forgotten details of several meetings
and documents on which she was questioned.
   At one point, when lawyer Philip Hirschkop asked her about notes
North took after meetings, she snapped, ``I don't sit around and
watch my boss.''
   The session, held in Hirschkop's office in a suburb of
Washington, D.C., was open to the public.
   The civil lawsuit was filed two years ago by the Christic
Institute, which is based in Washington, D.C.
   The institute is representing two American journalists _ Martha
Honey and Tony Avirgan _ who are seeking $22 million for injuries
Avirgan suffered when a bomb exploded at a May 1986 news conference
held in Nicaragua by former Contra leader Eden Pastora. Three
reporters were killed in the blast.
   The suit accuses 29 defendants of a series of conspiracies,
including plans to provide weapons to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua, smuggle cocaine into the United States to finance Contra
operations, and assassinate a U.S. ambassador in Costa Rica to
collect a bounty.
   The defendants include Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim,
businessmen who have also face criminal charges of theft and
conspiracy in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Thomas Green, attorney for Secord and Hakim, attended the
deposition.
   The trial in the Christic suit is scheduled to begin June 26 in
Miami.

   Despite the objections of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis,
13 Massachusetts National Guard public affairs specialists left
early Saturday for two weeks of training in Panama and Honduras.
   Dukakis, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential
nomination, held a news conference at the Statehouse after the
group's departure but did not comment on it.
   Dukakis opposes the Reagan administration's deployment of
National Guard troops in Central America on constitutional grounds
and has appealed a U.S. District Court ruling on May 6 that upheld
the assignment.
   The governor did not seek to block the departure pending a
resolution of the appeal because he could not prove the detachment
would suffer irreparable harm, but his press aide said Dukakis
would continue to contest the issue.
   ``We feel there's an important constitutional issue involved
concerning the 200 years of responsibility which states and
governors have had over the peacetime training of their militia
forces,'' James Dorsey, the press secretary, said Friday.
   The detachment, which consists of writers and photographers for
the Massachusetts Guard's quarterly newsletter, will observe U.S.
forces in the field and prepare accounts of their actions.
   ``It's important training for the unit. It will be germane to
their overall mobilization training that they have this
experience,'' said Lt. Col. Stuart Taubert, director of press
relations for Adjutant General Wayne Wagner of the Massachusetts
National Guard.
   Major Warren Pierce, 39, of Duxbury, commander of the 65th
Public Affairs Detachment, said last week he had no reservations
about the assignment.
   ``We're looking forward to it,'' he said.
   In January, when the state's request to be excused from the
training mission was denied by the Pentagon, Dukakis and state
Attorney General James Shannon filed suit charging that the orders
violated the constitutional provision that left the training of the
``militia'' in the hands of the states.
   A similar suit filed by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich was rejected
by another federal court and is also on appeal.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told Iran's
Parliament Saturday the war with Iraq will be decided on the
battlefield, not the negotiating table.
   Another Iranian official accused the Soviet Union of providing
Iraq with at least 800 long-range missiles, Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   IRNA quoted the deputy foreign minister, Ali Mohammad Besharati,
as saying in Tehran that Baghdad's recent victories were only
possible with U.S. and Soviet collaboration.
   Besharati did not say when Moscow, Iraq's main arms supplier,
provided the missiles, according to the report monitored in
Nicosia. But the Iraqis fired nearly 200 long-range missiles,
believed to modified Soviet Scud-B weapons, at Iranian cities
between Feb. 29 and April 21.
   Khomeini, Iran's 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch, made the
declaration about battlefield victories despite Iran's admission
that it suffered recent military defeats in the 7{-year war.
   ``The combatants must continue their fight by depending on their
faith in God and their weapons,'' he said in a statement that his
son, Ahmed, read to the opening session of the Majlis, Iran's
parliament. The statement was broadcast by Tehran Radio, also
monitored in Nicosia.
   ``The fate of the war will be decided on the war fronts, not
through negotiations,'' Khomeini said. ``Victory will be ours.''
   Tehran Radio said President Ali Khamenei acknowledged during a
Tehran prayer session Friday that the Iraqis defeated Iran's army
in recent weeks.
   He gave no details. But the unexpectedly blunt admission clearly
referred to Iraq's recapture of the Faw Peninsula in southern Iraq
on April 18 and an Iranian bridgehead east of the port city of
Basra last week.
   The Iranians captured Faw in February 1986 and had held about 76
square miles of Iraqi territory east of Basra since early last year.
   The Iranians also lost a frigate and a missile craft in clashes
with the U.S. Navy in the gulf April 18. Military analysts said
that was a serious blow to Iran's naval strength.
   Iran had seized the Iraqi territory in two bloody offensives. It
represented the main gains it has made in the conflict.
   Western military analysts said the setbacks have jolted the
Tehran leadership at a time of mounting economic woes and a power
struggle between radicals who want a state-run economy and
conservatives who support a capitalist-style system.
   Much of Khomeini's statement was devoted to efforts to reform
Iran's economy.
   He urged the 270-seat Majlis to do more for Iran's poor and
called for cooperation with the 13-member Council of Guardians,
which approves laws passed by the parliament. The council,
dominated by conservatives, has blocked radical-inspired economic
legislation in recent years.
   Radicals seeking economic reforms made major gains at the
expense of the conservatives in the two-stage elections in April
and May.
   Radicals seek price controls, a minimum wage, land
redistribution and other measures to help cope with runaway
inflation and economic inequities.
   Conservative clerics charge the economic reforms violate Islamic
tenets that property is inviolable. They are supported by the
wealthy merchant class. The new four-year parliament is the third
since Khomeini's revolution toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in
1979.

   Syrian troops on Saturday ringed the area
around the main barracks of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, where
Western hostages are believed held, after deploying across south
Beirut to end three weeks of militia fighting.
   A Syrian command source said the soldiers would remain outside
the Hay Madi district. But the move into south Beirut's slums
appeared to increase pressure on the Syrians to seek the release of
nine Americans and nine other foreign hostages held by pro-Iranian
groups believed linked to Hezbollah.
   In Damascus, Syria's information minister said despite the troop
movement, ``there is no timetable for the release of the hostages.''
   ``We are still in the first step which is stopping the
fighting,'' Mohammed Salman told reporters. ``We hope that through
dialogue and political action and cooperation with friends we can
obtain the release of the hostages.''
   A Lebanese security source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Syrian deployment around Hay Madi was meant to ``tighten
the grip on Hezbollah'' because ``the kidnappers will not be able
to move the hostages from one place to another.''
   The Syrians, who moved in Friday under an agreement that halted
the fighting between Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal militia,
were accompanied by 200 Lebanese police. The 1,500 soldiers
deployed Saturday raised the total number in the 16-square-mile
maze of streets and alleys to 2,600.
   There were no reports of violence. The fighting between the
rival Shiite militias broke out May 6 and left at least 300 people
dead and 1,000 wounded.
   The Syrian infantrymen, armed with automatic weapons and
rocket-propelled grenade launchers, moved in after Hezbollah and
Amal agreed to stop shooting. Hezbollah won control of 90 percent
of the slums in the fighting.
   Salman said Syrian troops were to withdraw ``within a few days''
and leave security in the hands of Lebanese police.
   But the information minister also said Syrian troops will remain
stationed at eight points on the perimeter of the area and be on
constant alert to move in ``when security demands or when requested
by the Lebanese security forces.''
   The Syrians made no attempt to deploy in the Hay Madi district.
A source at the Syrian command, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Hezbollah's barracks and its environs were ``not included in
the deployment plan.''
   However, they moved into surrounding districts and set up
checkpoints into the area.
   Most of the foreign hostages in Beirut are believed to be held
in the Hezbollah barracks. The hostage held longest is Terry
Anderson, Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The Syrians have said they want to help gain the hostages'
release. In Bahrain, Vernon Walters, Washington's U.N. ambassador,
said Saturday during a Middle East tour: ``The Syrians have assured
me they will do everything they can to help and preserve the life
and health of the hostages.''
   Women waved white scarves and threw roses and rice at the Syrian
soldiers in a traditional welcome gesture as they marched into the
embattled region.
   Civilians who had fled the fighting started returning to the
Syrian-policed districts Saturday.
   ``My life's earnings have gone,'' said Azzam Sadeq as he
inspected his fire-gutted third-floor apartment in Shiyah.
   ``I don't have furniture any more. My daughters' books and
clothes were also burned. We don't have enough money to repair the
damage and buy new furniture and clothes,'' he said with tears in
his eyes.
   In Bir el-Abed, a Hezbollah stronghold, Syrian troops took up
positions along the main street. But they did not enter the narrow
alleys and stayed away from the district's mosque, one of
Hezbollah's main bases.
   Unarmed Hezbollah members watched the Syrians deploy.
   Under the deployment plan, both factions must keep armed forces
inside the Green Line sector that lies on the slums' eastern edge.
   The Hay Madi district is considered part of the civil war Green
Line that divides Moslem west Beirut from the Christian east, said
the source at the Syrian command.
   The Syrian troops were guided through the slums Saturday by a
four-man committee of representatives of Hezbollah, Amal, the
Syrian military and the Iranian embassy in Beirut. Abdul Hadi
Hamadi, Hezbollah security chief and a reputed kidnap mastermind,
was on the committee.
   Hamadi's brothers, Mohammed Ali and Abbas, are held in West
Germany on terrorist charges.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi is accused of the 1985 hijacking of a TWA
jetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39 Americans
held hostage for 17 days.
   Abbas Hamadi has been convicted of kidnapping West Germans in
Beirut in January 1987 in an apparent effort to trade them for his
brother.

   Hundreds of opposition party supporters
tied up traffic on several highways in northern Mexico on Saturday
to protest a mayoral election they say was rigged.
   About 150 protesters used cars to form a bottleneck for two
hours at the four-lane highway from Chihuahua to the border city of
Juarez. Tie-ups also were reported in Monterrey, Monclova and
several other northern Mexican cities.
   ``We're not trying to take your time. This is an act of peaceful
resistance,'' a protester in Chihuahua told waiting motorists by
loudspeaker. Motorists had to wait several minutes to pass.
   The demonstrations were mounted to protest Friday's announcement
that the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party won a special
mayoral election in Monclova in neighboring Coahuila state, 200
miles south of the Texas border at El Paso.
   The Coahuila legislature said governing party candidate Benigno
Franco Colorado defeated Carlos Paez Falcon of the opposition
National Action Party by 233 votes in Monclova's May 8 special
election.
   Franco was sworn in Saturday morning under tight security, but
no incidents were reported.
   The opposition party insists its candidate won by 448 votes and
that it has the precinct voting tallies to prove the results were
rigged.
   ``This is just the first in a series of actions we're planning
to support the people of Monclova,'' said Guillermo Prieto,
National Action president in Chihuahua state.
   In Monclova, Paez Falcon said about 1,000 supporters tied up
traffic in a two-hour demonstration on two highways. He said
protesters stopped cars briefly to distribute leaflets.
   The governing party won the gubernatorial race and 37 of the 38
mayoralties at stake in regular elections held last Oct. 25.
   But the state legislature annulled the Monclova elections,
citing voting irregularities and violence and called for special
elections.
   For nearly a decade, the two political parties have battled to
control Monclova, a major steel-producing city of 300,000 people.
   Its most recent administration was controlled by a bilateral
commission headed by the PRI and appointed after neither party
could prove it won the 1984 mayoral race.

<HEAD>Turkish Soldier Killed By Greek-Cypriot Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek Cypriot police said Saturday they
killed a Turkish soldier who crossed the ethnic dividing line,
tried to rape a woman and shot two national guardsmen, one fatally.
   State radio said Greek Cypriot police stormed the woman's house
in Atheniou, a village near the Green Line that divides the east
Mediterranean island's ethnic Greek and Turkish sectors.
   Turkish Cypriot radio said the soldier crossed the demarcation
line by mistake and ``took refuge'' in a house near the Green Line.
   It was the second fatal shooting along the Green Line in a week.
   Cyprus has been divided since July 1974, when Turkey invaded
after a short-lived coup against the late President Makarios by
Greek Cypriot supporters of union with Greece. Turkey said its
purpose was to protect the eastern Mediterranean island's ethnic
Turkish minority.
   Turkish soldiers seized the northern third of the island and it
was proclaimed a separate republic in 1983, but only Turkey
recognizes it.
   Greek Cypriot police moved into the village southeast of Nicosia
several hours after the guardsmen were shot, and fatally shot the
soldier when he tried to fire at the officers, authorities said.
   The solder, one of 30,000 Turkish troops stationed on Cyprus,
crossed the Green Line and broke into the woman's home at about
6:30 a.m., the authorities said.
   On May 21, Austrian troops from the U.N. peacekeeping force on
Cyprus shot and killed a Turkish Cypriot, Hussein Kafa, who
officials said wounded one of the soldiers near the village of
Pyla, the only place Turkish and Greek Cypriots still live together.
   A second Austrian soldier was wounded by two of Kafa's relatives
and the assailants were arrested.
   Rauf Denktash, president of the Turkish Cypriot state, accused
Maj. Gen. Gunther Greindl, Austrian commander of the U.N. force, of
ordering Austrian troops to harass Kafa.

powerful U.S. warship ever seen in the Persian Gulf passed through
the Strait of Hormuz Saturday on its first mission in the war-torn
waterway.
   The guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes, with 385 officers and
crewmen aboard, entered the gulf to begin the first deployment in
the region by any of the navy's 10 Aegis cruisers.
   The 9,400-ton warship, commissioned in 1985 and equipped with
sophisticated radar and weapons systems, is the fourth U.S. Navy
warship named for the Indiana town where a decisive Revolutionary
War battle was fought.
   The level of tension ran fairly high during the ship's nighttime
run up the narrow strait. It passed about four miles from a
Panamanian-flag tanker, still on fire 20 hours after being attacked
by Iranian speedboats.
   Salvage tugboats were pouring water on the ship, which was
listing and appeared to have suffered severe fire damage to its
superstructure.
   The Vincennes crew also saw flames leaping high in the sky from
a burning structure on the Iranian side of the strait. It was not
certain whether it may have been Larak Island, an Iranian offshore
oil terminal devastated by Iraqi warplanes in a raid two weeks ago.
   The fast-moving warship was challenged by one of the Omani navy
boats that regularly patrol the straits to identify itself, and the
Vincennes, observing the standard Gulf protocol, said that it was
``an American warship, hull number 49.''
   Later, as it passed the Iran-held island of Abu Musa in the
southern gulf, the cruiser exchanged greetings with the missile
frigate Jack Williams, one of five U.S. ships scheduled to depart
the gulf in a few more days.
   Capt. Will C. Rogers III, skipper of the Vincennes, says the
ship is preparing for its gulf duty with help from one of the
strongest support networks for any ship in the U.S. Navy.
   Rogers said the Indiana town keeps a close eye on its namesake.
It hosts a civic blowout every August, a Christmas project in which
students at Vincennes University send gifts to every man aboard and
a two-year Vincennes University scholarship that goes annually to
the cruiser's ``sailor of the year.''
   `I've been on a lot of ships, and I've never seen anything like
it.'' Rogers said.
   Rogers said the active Vincennes support group began with three
veterans of the World War II-era cruiser by that name. It now has
more than 650 members, including Rogers and about 70 others of the
current ship's crew.
   The USS Vincennes Association has held annual reunions for the
past 13 years, with the Indiana town hosting parades and a feast
that last year featured 600 pounds of fresh catfish.
   Rogers, who attended the 1987 festival, said, ``I don't think
I've ever been made to feel so welcome or have been so royally
treated as in those four days.''

   A 25-year police veteran accused not only of
robbing a bank, but doing it while on duty, told investigators he
wanted to buy a house for his girlfriend, police said Saturday.
   Katsutoshi Yamane, a 46-year-old assistant inspector, was
arrested Friday afternoon soon after taking $22,000 from the Saga
Credit Bank brance in Tosu, western Japan.
   Yamane was dismissed from the force and police confiscated his
identification card, passport and handcuffs from an apartment he
apparently rented for the woman, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He quoted Yamane as saying he wanted to buy a house and land for
the Filipino woman, whom he met in 1986. The official did not
identify her, but said she had returned to Manila.
   Yamane was responsible for checking in and out the handguns
issued to police, who do not carry them regularly. Officials said
the one he fired into the air before fleeing the bank was issued
without permission.

   The head of a 46-nation Islamic organization on
Saturday appealed to President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev to look for a solution to the Palestinian situation
during their summit in Moscow.
   ``What is the difference between the Afghan mujahedeen and
Palestinian mujahedeen?'' asked the emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber
Ahmed Sabah, in a letter sent to the superpower leaders.
   ``Both peoples have an inalienable and historical right to their
country,'' said the emir, who sent the letter as chairman of the
Organization of Islamic Conference, which groups all Islamic
nations.
   Afghan guerrillas known as the mujahedeen, or ``holy warriors,''
are fighting the Soviet-backed government in Kabul.
   The emir praised the withdrawal of Soviets forces from
Afghanistan. He urged Reagan and Gorbachev to try to resolve the
Middle East problem, the Iran-Iraq war and the Lebanon crisis at
the summit.
   ``The Palestinian uprising should figure prominently in your
talks because what the Palestinians are currently suffering on the
land of their ancestors is but a form of flagrant aggression on
human rights and peace,'' he said.
   He referred to the Palestinian uprising since Dec. 8 against
Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, captured by
the Jewish state in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. At least 198
Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed in clashes.

   Unions representing airport ground workers reached a
tentative agreement Saturday with Alitalia and airport officials on
a new contract that may end months of disruptive wildcat strikes.
   The accord, which must be approved Monday by the country's main
trade union federation, was defined as ``conclusive and
unmodifiable'' by the unions, Rome's airport association and
Alitalia, Italy's state-run airline.
   Union officials said the pact provides improvements over the
accord signed by unions in March but rejected by the rank-and-file
in a referendum April 1.
   Under the accord, ground workers would receive an annual pay
increase of about $2,850 by July 1990, the news agency AGI
reported. The agency said weekly working hours would be reduced
from 41{ to 37{ over five years.
   For months, ground workers have staged temporary strikes at
Italian airports.

   Italians were to elect members of three provincial
councils and 1,200 town councils Sunday and Monday in the first
elections since Premier Ciriaco De Mita and his five-party
coalition formed a government last month.
   More than one-fifth of the Italian electorate _ 7 million voters
_ are eligible to choose the councils in towns and Pavia, Ravenna
and Viterbo provinces.
   Political commentators say the elections will focus on local
issues and are not expected to affect the balance of power in
national politics.
   But the results will give an indication of the political climate
after De Mita, leader of the conservative Christian Democrats,
formed Italy's 48th postwar government.
   The other partners in the coalition are the Socialists, the
Social Democrats, Republicans and Liberals.

<TEXT>
   A Syrian freighter carrying 2,000 tons of
toxic chemical waste will sail Sunday to Genoa to unload cargo that
first left this port for disposal 15 months ago, officials said.
   Giuseppe Francese, the port commissioner in Genoa, made the
decision to allow the Zanoobia, known in Italy as the ``ship of
poison,'' to unload in Genoa. Two people have died after possible
contamination by its waste after stops in Djibouti, Venezuela,
Syria and Greece.
   Francese said Genoa, 60 miles northwest of Carrara, is the only
Italian port that can safely unload and incinerate the 12,000 drums
of unidentified chemical waste from Italian chemical companies.
   The regional Ministry of Civil Protection approved the unloading
but said the ship must be moored in an isolated spot and
precautions must be taken to prevent fires or toxic fumes.
   Lawyers for the ship owner, Tabalo Shipping, say two people _ a
boy in Venezuela and a crewman during the voyage to Italy _ have
died after possible contamination by the waste.
   One of the attorneys, Francesco Rizzuto, said Italian
authorities are investigating.
   Three crewmen are hospitalized in nearby Massa suffering from
headaches, burning eyes, blisters, rashes or respiratory problems
attributed to the wastes.
   The ship has been anchored outside the Tuscan port of Carrara
since April 26.
   Rizzuto said a group of Italian shipping companies paid the
Milan-based company Jelly Wax to dispose of the waste. He said the
company instead shipped the waste out of the country.

   One of 48 prisoners released by Cuban
President Fidel Castro when Jesse Jackson visited Cuba in 1984 has
been charged with kidnapping and aggravated battery, police said.
   Robert Samuel Young, 39, was arrested at 6:30 p.m. Friday, after
more than a dozen Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies and police
circled a house where he and his girlfriend, Kathleen Kunzig, were
holed up, said sheriff's Lt. Donald Ganzel.
   They surrendered a few minutes later, said sheriff's detective
Charles Comfort.
   Young was being held without bond Saturday in the Palm Beach
County Jail on warrants charging kidnapping and aggravated battery,
a jail spokeswoman said.
   Ms. Kunzig, 33, also was being held without bond on a Broward
County warrant charging armed kidnapping, according to a
spokeswoman at the Palm Beach County Stockade.
   Young was one of 22 Americans freed from Cuba prisons after
Jackson, then as now a presidential candidate, made a humanitarian
mission to Cuba. Twenty-six Cubans were also freed. Young had been
jailed in Havana for three years on a drug smuggling charge, The
Miami Herald reported Saturday.
   Jackson, campaigning Saturday in New Jersey, was asked about
Young's arrest and replied: ``I don't know anything about that. I
haven't had any contact with them since I got them out.''
   The kidnapping charges stem from last August when a man was
ambushed after he repossessed a sailboat when Young defaulted on a
$15,000 loan, said Fort Lauderdale police Detective Steve
Robitaille.
   The ambush was allegedly carried out by Young, Ms. Kunzig and
two other men. Young shot the man twice and tortured him for two
hours until he revealed where a repossessed boat was docked,
Robitaille said.
   Fort Lauderdale police arrested Young in September, but he fled
several weeks later after posting $125,000 bond, the detective said.
   ``Bobby is a bad guy,'' said Robitaille, who has been hunting
for him since he disappeared last fall. ``He's definitely somebody
to be afraid of.''
   Young also is a suspect in the 1984 murder of John Panzavecchia
of Davie, said Miami homicide detectives Nelson Andreu and Jon
Spear. Panzavecchia's widow, Candy Panzavecchia, told police Young
and Ms. Kunzig were with her husband when he was killed.
   Young has not been charged in that shooting, police said.
   Castro has often been accused of releasing violent prisoners to
the United States on ostensibly humanitarian grounds.

<TEXT>
   The leftist government and rebel
leaders suspended peace talks Saturday but agreed to maintain a
current truce at least until the two sides meet again in 10 days.
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, the head of the government delegation,
blamed Enrique Bermudez, the rebel military commander, for the
failure to reach a definitive cease-fire agreement during the three
days of talks.
   A spokesman for the rebel delegation in Managua said the
``compromise suspension'' came after the rebels rejected a
government proposal for a 30-day cease-fire extension, a plan for
delivering humanitarian aid to rebel units, and a new round of
talks starting on June 15.
   The 60-day cease-fire in the 6-year-old war between the
U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras and the Sandinista government
was to expire Monday. The two sides agreed to meet again June 7-9
in Managua.
   ``There is no alternative,'' to extending the cease-fire, said
Luis Rivas Leiva of the Contra delegation. ``We do not want to
start shooting again.''
   President Daniel Ortega has declared a unilateral 30-day
extension of the truce on the part of his government.
   Gen. Ortega, the defense minister and the president's brother,
blamed Bermudez for the failure of the talks, saying ``he came here
to prevent an agreement.''
   Bermudez, who reportedly opposes a permanent cease-fire,
recently resisted an attempt by several members of the Contra
directorate to fire him.
   As talks resumed Saturday, the Sandinistas offered to discuss in
the ``national dialogue'' political reforms demanded in a Contra
proposal presented at the opening session Thursday.
   It presumably would involve meetings with opposition and other
groups representing the major elements of Nicaraguan society.
   Government negotiators said the process would follow
establishment of a permanent truce.
   Delegates agreed early Saturday on the need to extend the
cease-fire. There also appeared to be general agreement on
technical points dealing with verification of the truce, movement
of rebel fighters to safe zones and plans for a general amnesty.
   Gen. Ortega announced the Sandinista agreement to discuss
reforms.
   Among the rebel demands are political pluralism; separation of
state powers; human rights; freedom of expression, association and
religion; the right to strike, and the creation of an electoral
system that will guarantee free and honest elections in 1990.
   The government also said it wanted to discuss the function of a
mixed economy in Nicaragua, including different forms of ownership.
Contra leaders say the Sandinistas are leading the country to a
Marxist system of government and economy.
   A government source said: ``The Sandinistas have made many
concessions. It is up to the Contras to sign the document.''
   Gen. Ortega said ``considerable progress'' had been made in the
talks.
   He said the government urged the Contras to agree to let the
Pan-American Development Foundation distribute food and clothing to
rebel units in cease-fire zones. The foundation is linked to the
Organization of American States.
   Earlier this year, the U.S. Congress approved $17.7 million in
humanitarian aid for the rebels.
   Rivas Leiva said future negotiations would be difficult because
they must deal with interpretations of such terms as press freedom
and with the political conditions necessary for democracy.
   For example, the Contras feel the government must dismantle the
party-state structure, which they say gives the Sandinista National
Liberation Front total control over the government and army.

   Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse
Jackson on Saturday declared himself ``the general'' of the war on
drugs, while saying rival Michael Dukakis was just a captain and
Republican George Bush only a lieutenant.
   ``Bush thinks crack is sound. He doesn't know crack is a drug,''
Jackson said.
   Jackson told an enthusiastic crowd at a Hispanic Memorial Day
weekend picnic, Dukakis and Republican nominee-apparent Bush are
newcomers to the drug fight.
   ``Bush is lieutenant, Dukakis is a captain, but I'm the general
in this war on drugs,'' he declared.
   Jackson made light of the vice president's recent trip to an
alleged ``crack house'' in Los Angeles. Bush was accompanied by his
security detail and L.A. police officials.
   Jackson said Bush went on the excursion dressed in a
``bulletproof vest ... football pads ... high-button shoes.''
   Earlier, at an Atlantic City housing projet, Jackson blasted
Bush and the Reagan administration for what he called their
faltering anti-drug efforts.
   Jackson, campaigning in anticipation of New Jersey's June 7
primary, again attacked the administration's failed attempt to
negotiate an agreement with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega.
   Secretary of State George Shultz said earlier this week that
Noriega had abruptly changed his mind on an agreement to leave
Panama in return for the United States dropping its drug-dealing
indictment against him.
   ``Silence for sanctuary is sleeze. And that's a bad deal,''
Jackson said.
   He exhorted the housing project residents to join him in forcing
out drug pushers. Police said the area, within sight of streamlined
casino towers, is beset with drugs and gang violence
   ``There is no place in this housing project for dope pushers. I
say drive them out,'' Jackson said to cheers.
   He said blacks face a threat from drug dealers like they once
faced from the Ku Klux Klan.
   ``At least the Klansmen wore hoods. Those who push dope don't
wear hoods, they are hoods,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Jackson campaign got a boost Saturday from the
nation's largest black labor organization. The Coalition of Black
Trade Unionists approved a resolution endorsing Jackson at its
annual convention in Washington.

   The United States and Japan have agreed that U.S.
companies will receive more than a 30 percent work share in Japan's
development of new fighter planes, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The nationally circulated Yomiuri Shimbun, quoting anonymous
Japanese government sources, said working-level officials from the
two governments reached the agreement Friday night in a meeting at
the Defense Agency.
   Japanese defense officials were not available for comment
Saturday.
   There were no figures for the development costs but an initial
order of 100 of the new jets is estimated at $8 billion.
   The officials started their latest series of talks Tuesday on
the proposed joint development of Japan's next-generation fighter
plane, the FSX, the report said.
   Tokyo and Washington have debated U.S. participation in the
project since 1986.
   Japan first sought to develop the jet using its own technology,
while U.S. officials pressed for a joint project. Following a
series of negotiations, Japan decided last year to base the FSX
development on General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 fighter.
   The newspaper said the two sides also agreed in principle that
technological information gained in the research and development of
the plane would be shared by the two countries.
   Details of the joint development will be exchanged in June when
U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci visits Tokyo for talks with
the director general of the Defense Agency, Tsutomu Kawara, the
report said.

   An earthquake shook a small town in
southeastern Ohio shortly after noon Saturday, but there were no
reports of damage or injury, a state geologist said.
   The 12:18 p.m. temblor registered 3.5 on the Richter scale of
ground motion, with its epicenter in community of Gaysport, about
15 miles south of Zanesville, said Micheal Hansen of the state
Division of Geological Survey.
   Earlier Saturday, a 3.2 Richter quake rattled Boulder City,
Nev., about 10 miles southeast of Las Vegas, but there was no
damage or injury reported.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy a quake releases as recorded
by seismograph. A quake measuring 3.5 on the scale is capable of
inflicting slight damage locally.
   An one-number increase on the logarhythmic scale reflects a
tenfold increase in the severity of an earthquake.

<TEXT>
   A Florida neurologist whose Soviet husband has been
seeking permission to leave the Soviet Union for eight years said
Saturday she has received word that her husband will be allowed to
emigrate.
   Pyotr Pakenas has had 17 requests to emigrate denied since 1980,
when his wife, Dr. Galina Vileshina, 51, and two children left the
Soviet Union.
   Ms. Vileshina, who has waged a well-publicized campaign to
reunite her family, said she received notice from the State
Department on Saturday that Pakenas would be allowed to leave the
Soviet Union.
   ``So far I don't understand. To be honest I am really shocked,
and I can't believe it has really happened,'' she said Saturday
night in a telephone interview from her daughter's house in North
Palm Beach. ``Of course I'm superstitious. I worry about the plane,
the trip.''
   She said she believed the timing of the decision was tied to
President Reagan's Moscow summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, which starts Sunday.
   ``Of course, it's because of the summit and because of the
pressure of the American government,'' said Ms. Vileshina, who met
with Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Monday in Washington
about her husband's situation.
   ``I was waiting eight years for this happy moment in my life. I
started to cry, my body was shaking I was so happy,'' Ms. Vileshina
said.
   The family has stayed close through daily letters and weekly
telephone calls, and Ms. Vileshina visited with her husband in
Moscow last October.
   ``They said that we have very good news; your case has been
resolved,'' Pakenas' 29-year-old daughter, Laura Abovich, said of
the call from the State Department. Her 7-year-old son Eric has
never met his grandfather.
   Pakenas, 54, has received an invitation to meet with Reagan on
Monday as part of a small group of Soviet refuseniks, including
some so-called divided spouses, Mrs. Abovich said.
   She said the family called Pakenas after receiving the news, and
``he'll try to get out as soon as possible.''
   Asked when he might arrive, Mrs. Abovich said, ``We just can
judge from other people's cases, anywhere from two weeks to up to
six weeks. It really depends on the paperwork.''
   ``The last six months, especially after this last summit in
December,'' were the most difficult, Mrs. Abovich said. ``Waiting
every day, every day.''
   Ms. Vileshina said during her visit with her husband last year
that he had developed heart trouble and high blood pressure and
needed better medical treatment than he could get in the Soviet
Union.
   News of the breakthrough was hailed by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
who had been one of the family's supporters.
   ``She heard very good news today, but the real celebration will
occur when her husband joins his family on free soil,'' Graham
said. ``Our goal has been to reunite a family that suffered
separation long enough.''

maintains the defense laywer for a body-builder accused of killing
a hitchhiker.
   Horace Williams, 23, is charged with first-degree murder in the
September 1986 beating death of Michael Shane Patterson in Boca
Raton. The trial, being taped by a California television production
company for a series called ``On Trial,'' opened here Friday.
   Patterson's battered, naked body was found suspended between two
poles in a field, with his hands tied to one pole and his feet to
the other. He died from severe internal injuries that were
aggravated by the way he had been tied up, says a Palm Beach County
Medical Examiner's report.
   In his opening statement Friday, defense lawyer Richard Lubin
said he will fashion an insanity defense around expert testimony
that an 18-month regimen of almost daily steroid treatments caused
Williams' mental health to deteriorate ``without him even knowing
about it.''
   Anabolic steroids _ synthetic versions of the male hormone
testosterone _ are used by some athletes and weightlifters to
stimulate the production of proteins that increase muscle size and
strength.
   The drugs, which are available legally only by prescription,
also are blamed for making users more aggressive.
   
   The steroids made Williams ``a powder keg'' whose ``delusions
and mixed-up perception'' made it impossible for him to know that
the beating he gave Patterson caused his death, Lubin said.
   Assistant State Attorney Charles Burton called Patterson's death
a ``gruesome, brutal murder'' in which Williams and his friend,
William Whitmore, 21, tortured their victim for more than 30
minutes before leaving him for dead.
   Whitmore pleaded guilty to second-degree murder earlier this
month in exchange for a 40-year prison sentence.
   On the night Patterson was killed, Whitmore introduced his
friend, Edward Danielson, to Williams. Danielson, who is not
charged in the killing, testified Friday that the three men left
his house in search of a party.
   Later, they picked up Patterson hitchhiking, gave him a beer and
took him to a field, Danielson said. There, Williams demanded
money, and when Patterson said he had no cash, Williams told him to
strip, Danielson testified.
   Williams shredded Patterson's pants, and then Whitmore and
Williams began punching the man, he said.
   ``(Patterson) stood up and tried to run, but Horace grabbed him
from behind and stopped him,'' said Danielson, a Navy airman
stationed in Massachusetts.
   ``(Patterson) grabbed a board and tried to hit Horace, and then
he took the board and hit (Patterson) on top of the head,'' he
testified, adding that the victim pleaded for his life throughout
the ordeal.
   Police have alleged that Williams and Whitmore also beat
Patterson with a pipe, cut hair from his head and underarms, and
rammed his body with a car before tying him up.

<HEAD>Lehman: British Would Have Lost Falklands War Without U.S. Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain would not have recaptured the Falkland
Islands from Argentina in 1982 without U.S. military assistance,
former U.S. Navy Secretary John Lehman was quoted Sunday as saying.
   In a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview to be
broadcast Wednesday night, Lehman also says U.S. involvement in the
Falklands war led indirectly to the Irangate scandal, the Observer
newspaper reported.
   The weekly said Lehman's interview will be included in the
latest episode of ``An Ocean Apart,'' a BBC documentary series on
British-American relations.
   ``Britain would have had to have withdraw from the Falklands''
if the Reagan administration withheld support, it quoted Lehman as
saying.
   U.S. military aid in the 74-day war, in which Britain recaptured
the South Atlantic archipelago from invading Argentine forces, has
been a closely guarded secret, the Observer said.
   ``Lehman is the first senior U.S. official to claim that the
Pentagon's supplies of intelligence and material were so great as
to have been decisive,'' it said.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified Pentagon sources as saying
U.S. supplies during the war included 200 Sidewinder anti-aircraft
missiles, eight Stinger anti-aircraft systems, Harpoon anti-ship
missiles, mortar shells, satellite intelligence, communications
facilities and use of a U.S. air base on Ascension Island.
   It said the sources also indicated the U.S. Navy would have
loaned the 12,000-ton assault ship USS Guam if the British aircraft
carrier Invincible was sunk.
   ``In my judgment, the outcome would have been very different if
it weren't for the support and the flow of intelligence, of
logistics, of technical support, of communications, and of things
like Sidewinders from the United States to the Royal Navy,'' the
Observer quoted Lehman as saying.
   The war killed 712 Argentine and 256 British troops.
   Lehman was quoted as saying that when Latin American countries
learned of the U.S. aid, they withdrew support for the U.S.-backed
rebels fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista government, and Washington
was forced to find alternative means of supplying the rebels.
   ``The Argentines and all the other Latin Americans abruptly
stopped supporting the efforts of the Salvadorans and the Contra
forces against the Communists in Central America, and that led to
Contragate,'' he was quoted as saying.
   He apparently was referring to the U.S. funding of Nicaraguan
rebels from profits made from covert arms sales to Iran.
   Lehman was Navy Secretary from 1981 to 1987.
   Lord Lewin, former chief of Britain's Defense Staff, was quoted
on the same program as saying that ``we paid for everything we
got'' from the United States and he confirmed the importance of
U.S. intelligence in winning the war.
   Lewin was quoted as saying he asked Lehman in the U.S. Navy
``for an account of the Argentine forces' operational
effectiveness. ... He sent me almost a book, which was extremely
useful.''

   Former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North
invoked the memory of those who died in Vietnam in a Memorial Day
weekend address Saturday at a fair in suburban Philadelphia.
   ``Let us, if we must, debate the lessons learned in Vietnam,''
North told about 2,000 people at the Pennsylvania Fair at the
Philadelphia Park race track. ``Today we simply say, `Thank you,
dear son, may God cradle you in his loving arms.'
   ``It is not too much to ask that we remember them, that we think
of them, that each one of us do our utmost to preserve what they
died for in Vietnam.''
   About 20 protesters were visible as North spoke from an outdoor
podium, and some people tried to block protest banners from his
view.
   North, a fired National Security Council aide, also jested about
his status as a major figure in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``It's nice to be somewhere without a subpoena,'' he said.
``There's almost as many here as makes up a congressional
subcommittee.''
   North, who has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to defraud
the government and of obstructing investigations, spoke on
``Commitment, Trust and Family.''
   He made few direct comments on his legal problems, but vowed to
``prevail, even in Washington.''
   Earlier this week, the judge in the case said that the
congressional immunity granted North and two co-defendants could
make trying them on conspiracy charges a ``practical
impossibility.''
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said Thursday he hoped to
decide by the end of June whether to grant defense motions to
dismiss the indictment.
   ``Certainly it was not my intention to be caught in the middle
of a bitter dispute between the President and the Congress over the
control of our foreign policy,'' North said of the affair. ``But we
haven't been alone in this struggle eithe.''

<TEXT>
   Elaine Black Yoneda, a Communist party
member who led labor revolts in the Depression and was dubbed ``The
Red Angel'' by union colleagues, has died at age 81.
   Mrs. Yoneda died Thursday, one day after attending a union rally
for presidential candidate Jesse Jackson. She had been ill for a
month.
   In 1931, she moved to Southern California from New York City to
become secretary of International Labor Defense, which provided
legal aid to trade unionists. She was a Communist party member from
1931 until her death.
   One of the first people she bailed out of jail was Communist
Party member Karl Yoneda, a Japanese native who changed his first
name in honor of Karl Marx. They were married in 1935.
   She spent eight months in a Japanese detention camp during World
War II with her husband and their son. Despite his detention, Karl
Yoneda later served as an intelligence officer in the Pacific
theater.
   Mrs. Yoneda was the only woman on the steering committee of San
Francisco's general strike in 1934, which grew out of a waterfront
and maritime strike after two demonstrators were killed by police.
   The same year, she and other activists were arrested at a
protest and jailed for vagrancy, a charge dimissed after two trials
and a hunger strike. ``They are not vagrants,'' an appellate judge
ruled. ``They are Communists.''
   Mrs. Yoneda was arrested on other occasions for disturbing the
peace, inciting a riot, ``seditious utterances'' and unlawful
assembly during labor and antiwar demonstrations.
   From the late 1950s until she retired in 1973, Mrs. Yoneda was a
clerical worker for the International Lonshoremen's &
Warehousemen's Union-Pacific Maritime Association pension fund.
   She was an active member of the Office & Professional Employees
International Union Local 29 until this year and also was president
of the ladies' auxiliary of ILWU Local 16.
   She is survived by her husband; a daughter and son; and two
grandchildren.

   A Kansas man successfully defended his
title Saturday in the 19th World Championship Cow Chip Throwing
Contest but strong winds derailed the defending woman's champion.
   Roy Kygar of Kismet, Kan., won the men's title with a fling of
151 feet, 2 inches.
   Winds that gusted over 30 mph weren't as kind to five-time
defending woman's champion Kay Hankins of Prairie Du Sac, Wis.,
blowing both of her chips out of bounds.
   That opened the door for Catherine Westenhaver of Forgan, 7
miles north of here, who won with a toss of 83 feet.
   The contest capped a week of festivities in this small Panhandle
town of about 6,800. The contest's raw material _ dried, flattened
chunks of cow dung _ was hauled in from local pastures.
   Trophies and jackets also were presented to winners in
children's and VIP divisions.

   Comedian Bob Hope is celebrating his 85th
birthday Sunday by traveling to Louisville, Ky., to take part in a
benefit golf tournament.
   Hope said he played nine holes of golf Saturday to prepare. When
asked how well he played he joked, ``I don't want to talk about it.
I'm trying to shoot my age. I think I'll make it if I live long
enough.''
   Hope and his wife Dolores, whose birthday was Friday, will have
a joint celebration dinner Sunday night after they arrive in
Louisville for the Foster Brooks Celebrity Golf Tournament.
   Reached by telephone Saturday at his home in Toluca Lake, an
affluent residential area, Hope was asked how he feels as he turns
85. ``I don't feel a thing,'' he replied.
   Mrs. Hope was in Michigan Saturday to attend a family
graduation, and Hope's plane will pick her up Sunday en route to
Louisville.
   After the Louisville appearance, Hope plans to rest and play
more golf at Fort Walton Beach, Fla., for a few days. Then he's
heading for Nashville, Tenn., to serve as captain for one of the
teams in the Barbara Mandrell Celebrity Softball game.
   Later in his trip he will make his annual appearance at another
southern event, a benefit golf tournament honoring blind golfer
Charlie Boswell.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance nominated businessman Alfredo Cristiani on
Saturday as its candidate for the March 1989 presidential election.
   Cristiani, 42, president of the party known by its Spanish
acronym Arena, was unopposed for the nomination.
   Party leaders said internal divisions have split the governing
Christian Democrats and would make Cristiani El Salvador's next
president.
   Arena founder Roberto d'Aubuisson, who sponsored the nomination,
called Cristiani ``my brother'' and ``the man who will take us to
victory. The armed forces respect him.,'' d'Aubuisson told party
supporters at the nominating convention.
   In his acceptance speech, Cristiani accused the government of
corruption and attacked the leftist Faribundo Marti National
Liberation Front, which has waged an 8-year-old guerrilla war
against the U.S.-supported government.
   ``The people already have turned their backs to the
(guerrillas),'' said Cristiana.
   Arena won at least 30 of the 60 seats in the National Assembly
in elections held March 20. The party has asked the Supreme Court
to reverse the awarding of another seat to the Christian Democrats.
   The governing party chose Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes as its
candidate last month in a bitter nominating convention that was
boycotted by Fidel Chavez Mena, his chief rival, and President Jose
Napoleon Duarte, the Christian Democrats' honorary chairman.
   Under law, Duarte, elected in 1984, cannot run for a second
five-year term.
   In an interview with The Associated Press in April, Cristiani
said that if Arena won the presidency, Washington's Salvador policy
would have to change drastically.
   ``Relations will have to be based on mutual respect. No more
coming down here and saying, `Here's so many millions of dollars
and this is what you have to do,''' he said.
   Cristiani said the State Department and U.S. Embassy have waged
a consistent campaign against Arena, founded in 1981.
   ``We have always felt under tremendous attack from the
government of the United States,'' he said, though he noted
conservative Salvadorans maintain an abiding affinity for the
United States.
   ``The U.S. is our natural ally,'' he said in the interview.

   A state senator, under indictment on a
charge that he accepted a bribe while serving as a county
commissioner, has been named chairman of the Mingo County
Democratic Party.
   Sen. Truman Chafin is the fifth consecutive Mingo County
Democratic chairman to face criminal charges.
   He faces a state bribery charge in a scheme to sell the
sheriff's job from Johnie Owens to Charles ``Eddie'' Hilbert for
$100,000. Owens, a former county Democratic chairman, and Hilbert
have pleaded guilty to charges in connection with the scheme.
   Chafin, accused of accepting a bribe to stay away from the
commission meeting which approved the transfer of the job from
Owens to Hilbert, has pleaded innocent and denies any involvement
in the alleged scheme.
   The county Democratic Executive Committee voted 7-6 Thursday to
name Chafin county chairman.
   The previous chairman, E. Donald Evans, resigned at the request
of the U.S. attorney's office after being indicted a month ago on a
conspiracy to commit vote fraud charge.
   His predecessor was Owens, who is serving a 14-year federal
prison sentence.
   Owens' predecessor as chairman was Stewart Justice, who was
acquitted on a state bribery charge last year. Justice's
predecessor, Noah Floyd, was acquitted on federal conspiracy
charges in the early 1970s.
   The politically powerful county chairmanship had been vacant for
a month since Evans resigned. Local politicians say they can never
remember the post being vacant for so long.
   Mingo, a poverty-stricken coal-mining county, has borne a
reputation for corruption for years. In 1986, the fire chief of
Kermit was convicted of running a ``drug carry-out'' operation next
door to the town police department.
   In elections for county office on May 11, the voters rejected
three of five candidates under criminal indictment.

   Ethiopia will allow the European
Economic Community to monitor drought relief operations in the
war-torn north following an EEC threat to cut off food shipments,
an European official said Saturday.
   EEC delegate Benno Haffner told reporters he received assurances
from officials of the Marxist government Friday night that he can
visit the northern provinces this week.
   The assurances follow an EEC letter to the government's chief
relief official, Berhanu Jembere, expressing ``deep concern and
regret'' over the situation and threatening to cut off further food
shipments.
   The EEC is Ethiopia's biggest food donor, followed by the United
States and the Soviet Union.
   The government has requested emergency aid to help feed 7
million people threatened with starvation nationwide following
severe crop failures.
   Haffner said the letter followed the government's failure to
fulfill a contract permitting a representative of the European
community to visit regions where EEC food is distributed.
   The EEC is giving 234,000 tons of emergency food to Ethiopia, 75
percent of which is going to the provinces of Eritrea and Tigre,
where an estimated 3.2 million drought victims live.
   Haffner said the government has not allowed an EEC delegate to
visit the war-torn regions since April 6, when Ethiopia expelled
foreign aid workers from the north following a string of rebel
victories which a government withdrawal.
   Insurgents have been fighting the government for 14 years in
Tigre and for 27 years in Eritrea.
   Marxist Ethiopia will not allow relief officials to operate
beyond the shrunken areas still under its control. Western relief
officials estimate 2 million people in Eritrea and Tigre are
outside government-controlled areas and are in danger of starving
to death.

   Basque separatists claimed
responsibility Saturday for the shooting death of a restaurant
owner and a grenade attack on a Civil Guard barracks.
   In a note to newspapers, the separatist group ETA claimed the
attack Wednesday in which three youths shot and killed Sebastian
Aizpiri Lejaristi, 37, as he walked to his restaurant in Eibar, a
town 20 miles east of San Sebastian.
   The group gave no motive for the killing.
   ETA, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque
language, seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
Basque region.
   The group also said its members fired two rocket-propelled
grenades against a Civil Guard barracks Friday in the town of
Arrigorriaga, a suburb of Bilbao, the largest Basque city. The
grenades slightly damaged the building but caused no injuries,
police said.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing three policemen and a
retired general this year.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, the separatist group has claimed
responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mainly police and
servicemen.

   China ordered construction halted immediately on
24 major building projects in Beijing to fight extravagence and
waste, the official People's Daily reported Saturday.
   The State Council, China's highest governing body, announced
Friday that it would cut back some of Beijing's 174 major
construction projects.
   Twenty-four would be stopped immediately, including an office
building for the State Administration of Taxation and residences
for the Ministry of Railways, the newspaper said.
   Premier Li Peng said in a meeting Friday with Burma's
vice-premier, U Tin Tin, that the cutbacks are necessary to fight
extravagance. He said people have many complaints about unnecessary
building.
   The newspaper, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, heralded
the decision in a front-page editorial, saying that blindly putting
up expensive hotels creates an unrealistic impression of China to
the rest of the world.
   ``The broad masses have good reason to resent this. We are a
developing country with a financial deficit and have many things to
attend to,'' the editorial said.
   China's deficit last year was estimated at $2.16 billion.

   CHA-AM, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand on Saturday urged international
pressure on Hanoi and the repatriation of Vietnamese fleeing their
country who are determined to be migrants rather than refugees.
   Participants at a conference on Vietnamese ``boat people'' also
called for more resettlement of refugees by third countries and an
expanded Orderly Departure Program from Vietnam to alleviate what
they said was the ``gravest Indochinese refugee crisis since 1979.''
   ``Pressure must be exerted by all concerned on Vietnam to
recognize the humanitarian consequences of the (refugee) outflow
and the negative image created for Vietnam,'' a senior Thai Foreign
Ministry official, Pracha Guna-kasem, said at the conclusion of a
four-day meeting.
   The conference, sponsored by the Ford Foundation, brought
together officials from the six countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, as well as Hong Kong, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees and observers from Japan, Sweden, United
States, Australia and New Zealand.
   The group's recommendations are to be submitted at a ASEAN-Hong
Kong meeting in Bangkok this week.
   The U.N. refugee commission said that it was handling about
40,000 Vietnamese boat people in Asia as of March 31 this year, up
from 32,000 the same period two years ago.
   The largest numbers are found in Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong,
the Philippines and Indonesia.

<TEXT>
   A proposed flight from Nome to the
Siberian town of Provideniya won Soviet clearance on Saturday, but
it came as such a surprise that the ``Friendship Flight'' dreamed
2{ years ago must be delayed.
   Soviet officials told Gov. Steve Cowper the 240-mile flight can
take place on Tuesday, the day Alaska's organizers of the trip
proposed months ago.
   Alaska Airlines has to postpone the flight, however, to ensure
Provideniya's runway can withstand a jet filled with politicians,
business leaders, the press and Eskimo people seeking reunions with
Siberian kin.
   ``We were aware of the fact that the Soviets normally give you
pretty short notice on decisions like this, so it was not a
surprise that they called four days before it was supposed to
happen,'' Cowper said.
   Approval of the trip clearly was tied to the Moscow summit talks
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
Cowper said. He said he hopes the trip can take place in June.
   Cowper said the clearance of a flight for Tuesday was
particularly surprising because he thought Soviet officials were
concerned the journey would draw some attention away from the
summit.
   Alaska Airlines hopes to send technical staff to Provideniya in
a twin-engine plane on Tuesday, airline spokesman Jim Johnson said.
Permission for the ``pre-flight'' was sought through diplomatic
channels on Saturday.
   ``They (the Soviets) gave us some information about the runway,
but we need to see first hand if it's suitable for a jet,'' Johnson
said.
   Nome businessman Jim Stimpfle has been pushing the trip for 2{
years. He said he used to stand on a Bering Sea beach and wonder
what was going across the water in the Soviet Union.
   People in Nome remember how he used to send balloons containing
gum and sewing needles over the ocean in hopes they would reach
people on Siberia's Chukotsk Peninsula.
   ``It's been a day that I think we will all remember, and
hopefully it will be the beginning of many good things between the
Soviet Union and the people of Alaska,'' Stimpfle said Saturday.
   Alaska Airlines wants to use a Boeing 737 for the 25-minute
flight from Nome to Provideniya and is hopes that with only about
70 passengers instead of the usual 111 and luggage, Provideniya's
rustic runway will handle the plane.
   Airline officials have been told the runway is between 1600 and
1800 meters and has a surface of gravel and sand, but they've also
heard it described as a ``dirt'' landing strip. They want to see it
for themselves, Johnson said.
   He said the flight can be arranged quickly once the runway
conditions are known. Plans call for a morning departure from Nome,
an early dinner in Provideniya and an evening flight back to Nome
across the Bering Sea.
   The trip has become one of the more attention-getting components
of Alaska's effort to establish ties and possibly eventual trade
with the Soviet Union.
   Several weeks ago, Gorbachev's chief spokesman, Gennadi
Gerasimov, spoke optimistically in Alaska about the prospects for
warmer relations between the neighbors.
   Passengers aboard the flight are expected to include Eskimos
separated from their kin for decades by the political chill between
the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Alaska Airlines is hoping the flight will be more than a media
event, and is interested in offering regular service to
Provideniya's peninsula.

<HEAD>EEC Publishes ``Atlas Of Avoidable Death''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ``Atlas Of Avoidable Death''
published by the European Economic Community showed that more than
1 percent of deaths in the EEC involving illness and childbirth are
avoidable, officials said Friday.
   Paolo Fasella, the EEC's head of science, research and
development, said the survey tried to use mortality data as a means
to study the health services within the EEC.
   The editor of the 356-page book, British Professor Walter
Holland, said the number of avoidable deaths in the EEC is ``very
small indeed.''
   Fasella said it amounts to about 50,000 deaths a year.
   Holland said given the proper medical attention or public health
action the diseases surveyed should result in ``very few, if any,
deaths.''
   The survey looked at 17 illnesses, including appendicitis,
Hodgkin's disease, womb cancer, tuberculosis, asthma, deaths
resulting from childbirth, and infant mortality.
   Holland cautioned that the figures only served to indicate the
existence of problems in the EEC's health sector, not their nature.
   ``The atlas cannot provide any answers, but it points to areas
for investigation,'' he said.
   He said the causes of high mortality rates were ``extremely
complex,'' but the statistics showed clearly there was ``no
correlation between the money spent,'' the organization of health
services and the death rate in each member state.
   Holland, head of the department of community medicine at the
United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St. Thomas's
hospitals in London, stressed a high death rate for the same
disease in two different areas did not mean the same problem
existed in both areas.
   ``It merely indicates there may be a problem,'' he said.
   As an example, he said deaths from womb cancer could be due to
insufficient public health information or the unavailability of
screening tests in that area.
   Only 10 of the 12 EEC member states were surveyed for the atlas.
The book's statistics date from 1974-78. Spain and Portugal joined
the trade bloc in 1986.

<HEAD>Japan Seeks End To Deadlock On Beef Imports, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will seek to end a deadlock in talks with the
United States on opening its market to foreign beef by offering new
import duties instead of steep surcharges, a Japanese newspaper
reported Friday.
   Yomiuri Shimbun said Japan would offer to raise the current 25
percent duty on imported beef to ``more than 70 percent.'' Its
previous proposal, rejected by U.S. negotiators, was to impose an
additional 75 percent surcharge which would have doubled the price
of foreign beef when sold on the Japanese market.
   The surcharge would have gone to a semi-official corporation and
be used to stabilize domestic beef prices and aid Japanese farmers.
   The newspaper said the new offer will be made in working-level
talks in Washington next week and represents Japan's ``ultimate
compromise proposal.'' It said the new tariff rate would continue
for at least three years, and would compensate for removal of
present import quotas.
   Japanese government officials have said duties or surcharges are
needed to protect Japanese farmers if quotas are eliminated.
   An official of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he could
``neither confirm or deny'' the report.
   A four-year Japan-U.S. agreement setting annual increases in
Japanese import quotas on beef and citrus imports expired in March.
No new agreement has been reached in talks since then, including
talks in Washington last month between Agriculture Minister Takashi
Sato and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
   Sato refused to comply with a U.S. demand that Japan specify a
short timetable for an end to the import quotas on the two items
and sharply reduce the level of the proposed duties and surcharges.
   On May 4, the United States took its case to the General
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, an international trade body based
in Geneva. Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and other Japanese
officials say they want to continue to seek a solution through
bilateral talks.

   Twelve jurors were sworn in Friday for
former Gov. Evan Mecham's criminal trial on charges of concealing a
$350,000 campaign loan.
   Mecham, 64, faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted of all
six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false
documents. Willard Mecham, who was his brother's 1986 campaign
treasurer, faces three similar counts and up to 9{ years in prison.
Both have denied any wrongdoing.
   Mecham did not attend Friday's session in Maricopa County
Superior Court. He was traveling to Altamont, Utah, to address
graduates at his former high school. Mecham's brother and
co-defendant, Willard Mecham, sat with his lawyer.
   Opening statements are scheduled for Thursday, one day after the
Arizona Supreme Court hears arguments on a defense request to
return the charges to the state grand jury for a new determination
of probable cause.
   Mecham, a Republican who took office in January 1987, was
removed from office April 4 when the state Senate convicted him of
two unrelated impeachment counts.
   The jurors include five Republicans and two Democrats.
   Nine said they had no opinion on whether Mecham should have been
recalled from office, while three said they opposed a recall. A
recall election had been scheduled for May but was abandoned after
Mecham's impeachment conviction.
   ``I think this is a jury that's capable of giving us a fair
trial,'' said the former governor's attorney, Michael Scott.

   Fifteen paintings taken from the Philippines by

purportedly taken by former President Marcos and his wife, Imelda,

   The paintings were secretly stored in the French Riviera. Laude
said it was not clear exactly how many paintings were involved.
   Le Monde newspaper said Friday that about 30 paintings, among
them works by Spanish master El Greco and French romanticist
Francois Boucher, were involved.
   Laude declined to place a value on the works returned Thursday
or say to whom they were delivered, noting: ``There is a New York

   The second of five children wounded in a
school shooting rampage by a babysitter was released from the
hospital Friday, as authorities continued their investigation into
the assailant's background.
   No new information has emerged in the probe of 30-year-old
Laurie Dann, who fatally shot herself after killing one youngster
and injuring six other people May 20 in this wealthy Chicago
suburb, said Police Sgt. Gene Kalvaitis.
   Toxicology reports have turned up no evidence of drugs in her
system, but complete findings will not be available until the end
of next week, said Cook County Medical Examiner Dr. Robert Stein.
   Six-year-old Robert Trossman, who was shot in the chest by Ms.
Dann in a bathroom at Hubbard Woods School, was released Friday
morning from Evanston Hospital, said spokeswoman Barbara Traeger.
   The child most critically injured when Ms. Dann opened fire in a
classroom, 8-year-old Lindsay Fisher, was upgraded from fair to
good condition a day after being to a regular pediatric ward, Ms.
Traeger said.
   The first shooting victim to be released from the hospital went
home Thursday.
   One other injured youngster at Evanston Hospital was in good
condtion, while the two other people who were injured were reported
in fair condition at Highland Park Hospital, said a spokeswoman
there, Sue Masarrachia.
   No information was released Friday about a friend of Ms. Dann's
who was arrested Thursday for allegedly making threatening
telephone calls similar to those Ms. Dann made in the weeks before
the shooting spree.
   Sheri L. Taylor, 34, of Highland Park, was committed
involuntarily Thursday to psychiatric treatment at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, but spokeswoman Debbie
Jenkins said no update would be made until next week.
   Documents filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court showed Ms.
Taylor had signed for voluntary admission to the hospital's
psychiatric unit, agreeing to stay if necessary up to 30 days, when
she will be reevaluated.
   Police said Ms. Taylor was taken into custody late Wednesday at
the Highwood convenience store where she worked. Ms. Taylor later
surrendered a .357 Magnum handgun she kept in the hotel room where
she lived.
   The FBI in Madison, Wis., where Ms. Dann had been living, has
said she apparently acted alone in obtaining poison she used to
lace about two dozen packages of snacks and juice that she sent or
delivered to acquaintances before last week's shooting spree.
   No one was seriously sickened.

   HELSINKI, Finland (AP)_ President Reagan, emerging from
pre-summit isolation, today appealed to Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to enter the Western ``House of Democracy'' by embracing
the values enshrined in the 1975 Helsinki agreement.
   Sounding the human rights theme he will stress in their talks in
Moscow, Reagan praised Gorbachev's ``glasnost'' and the openness
that has flourished in his three years at the Kremlin helm.
   But while dissidents are released from labor camps and books and
movies criticizing the communist system gain currency, the
president said, ``Soviet practice does not _ or does not yet _
measure up to Soviet commitment.''

   That theme was heard often during the two weeks of floor debate

arms agreements.

was riddled with blunders and miscalculations, according to a
number of independent experts.
   But while many of the experts found fault with the way the

the United States can do now to achieve its goals of an apolitical

   ``We're in for the long haul,'' said Eva Loser of the Center for

   To some experts, the United States looked both foolish and weak

   Michael Dukakis is the biggest tax raiser and tax

in a curious position as a Democratic presidential candidate.
   The likely nominee can accurately lay claim to the tax-cutter
title. But Republican nominee-in-waiting George Bush can just as
correctly claim Dukakis is a tax-raiser.
   The Massachusetts governor talks frequently of cutting taxes
while mopping up Republican deficits, a pitch aimed at voters
worried about the federal deficit. But Dukakis is mindful of
Democratic nominee Walter Mondale's frank 1984 statement that he
would raise taxes if elected president, a promise that contributed

   Exemption from taxes and import duties, development projects and

   Kim and Greg Williams, in the way of twins, grew up doing almost
everything together. For the past four years, however, they endured
life apart, cadets in different uniforms at rival military
academies.
   On Wednesday, Kim becomes an Air Force second lieutenant, and
her brother, who graduated from the Naval Academy last week and was
commissioned a reserve second lieutenant in the Air Force, will
administer her oath.
   ``There's no one I'd rather have do it,'' said Kim.
   At 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, about 12 hours before the Air Force
Academy graduation at Colorado Springs, Colo., Greg will swap his
reserve commission to be a regular Air Force officer, following his
life-long desire to fly and a hope to be stationed eventually with
his twin.
   The twins, 21, from Fort Walton Beach, Fla., are the children of
a career officer, retired Air Force Lt. Col. James R. Williams. He
performed swearing-in honors for Greg at the Naval Academy ceremony
in Annapolis, Md., on May 25.
   The twins says a healthy rivalry got them into and through the
military academies.
   Greg, the one who wanted to fly all his life but whose eyesight
wasn't good enough for him to be a pilot, says he's happy Kim was
the one accepted by the Air Force Academy. He plans to be a
navigator.
   ``She'll probably be a colonel before I'm a colonel,'' he said.
``She's a hard worker _ she deserves it.''
   Said Kim, the older of the two by 10 minutes: ``I felt kind of
bad, because Greg wanted to be a pilot so bad. If I could give him
my eyes, I would.''
   The twins say their separate strengths have made it easier for
them to share each other's successes.
   Greg graduated in the top 5 percent of his class at the Naval
Academy and says studying comes easier to him. He plays a lot of
sports but concedes that Kim, who played softball for the Air Force
Academy and managed the women's basketball team for three years, is
the family athlete.
   Their three older siblings are Tony, 31, who works for CARE in
New York City; Kaye Miller, 28, married to an Air Force officer in
Florida, and Janet, 26, who enlisted in the Air Force and serves in
Wiesbaden, West Germany.
   Greg still remembers when the two played Little League baseball.
   ``She was playing first base and I was in the outfield. People
used to kid me and I said, `Can you beat her out of first base?'
And no one could,'' he said.
   When Kim made the Little League all-stars, Greg went and cheered
her on.
   He kept up the cheering, she said, when she was ready to drop
out of the Air Force Academy during a difficult first year.
   ``He's probably the biggest influence on what I do,'' said Kim.
``I thought about quitting ... and I guess the biggest thing was,
my Mom said, `What will Greg think?' ... He always says, do what
you want to do, but keep the long-term goals in mind.''
   Kim said having a twin brother also helped her cope better than
some other female cadets with lingering discrimination at the
academy.
   ``We played sports together growing up, we did everything
together, and I played with his friends probably more that I did
with the females. That's probably helped me adjust better and put
up with the criticism around here,'' she said.
   For Greg, the four-year separation taught independence,
according to the twins' mother, Julia Williams, who said in high
school Kim ``had tended to look after him _ to make sure his shoes
were polished.''
   ``I still do,'' said Kim.
   Through their academy years, the twins telephoned each other
every couple weeks and spent summers and vacations together. Each
fall, they sat together at the Navy-Air Force football game.
   Despite occasional loneliness, they said they probably helped
each other better from a distance because they didn't hit the same
bumps at the same times.
   Together in the Air Force, they face more separation.
   Second Lt. Kim Williams will begin pilot training at Columbus
Air Force Base, Miss., this fall, while 2nd Lt. Greg Williams
enters navigator training at Mather Air Force Base, Calif.
   They say they would love to fly together someday, but the Air
Force doesn't allow siblings in the same aircraft.
   ``Hopefully, one day we'll get stationed in the same place,''
said Greg.
   But when football season comes around, he added, he'll probably
always root for Navy.

   The strong showing in the French presidential
elections of National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen has lent
encouragement to others in Western Europe who share his
nationalistic, anti-immigrant views.
   Le Pen's main campaign theme _ France for Frenchmen _ contended
that an influx of immigrants, mainly Arabs from North Africa, was
diluting French traditions and adding to the nation's economic and
social problems.
   He is said to be planning to take his message to other European
countries.
   After Le Pen won more than 14 percent of the vote in
presidential balloting April 24, extreme right wing parties in
Belgium, Italy, Greece and elsewhere expressed hope that his
success would be contagious. The National Front now holds 35 seats
in the 577-member French National Assembly.
   Chrysanthos Dimitriades, a member of the European Parliament and
of Greece's extreme right National Political Union, told The
Associated Press that Le Pen's gains ``improved our spirit, there
has been a positive change.''
   The Belgium National Front, a sister to the French party, ``got
hundreds of phone calls from people who wanted to join'' after the
April 24 vote, said party spokesman Daniel Feret.
   ``Basically we heard from people who share our ideas but thought
we were a marginal party. Le Pen changed that,'' he said.
   Le Pen's campaign subtly conveyed the message that dark-skinned
foreigners are invaders who undermine the French way of life and
take jobs. His speeches tapped a vague, mostly unarticulated
feeling that France is on the decline, its traditions in jeopardy
and its ``national identity'' threatened.
   He kept the immigration issue at the center of his campaign,
suggesting legal measures to encourage immigrants in France to move
elsewhere and limiting the number of immigrant children in schools.
He appealed to nationalistic sentiments and authoritarian values,
favoring restoration of the death penalty and the quarantining of
AIDS victims.
   Europe's extreme right parties share a common desire to convert
concern about immigration into votes, but they have yet to come
near getting the kind the success Le Pen's National Front received
in France, even though their countries face economic and social
problems similar to those of the French.
   Some of the parties have registered some successes but others
remain far out on the fringe, with little or no representation in
their respective parliaments and little chance right now of
influencing governments.
   In Greece, for example, Dimitriades' National Political Union
won just 0.6 percent of the vote in the last national elections, in
1985, and that represented a drop from the 2.3 percent it won in
the European Parliament vote a year earlier. While Dimitriades won
a seat in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, his party remains
out of Parliament at home.
   Belgium's National Front also has no representation in the
nation's 212-seat House of Representatives and is so far out on the
fringes that it does not figure in public-opinion polls.
   Le Pen's National Front holds 35 just seats in France's
577-member National Assembly, but he himself has been gaining over
the years _ from 0.74 percent of the vote in the 1974 presidential
election, 11 percent in the 1984 European Parliament balloting to
14.4 percent in April.
   Gianfranco Fini, secretary of the vaguely neo-fascist Italian
Social Movement, is optimistic about the outcome in France.
   He maintains immigrants pose a grave threat to all European
countries.
   Unemployment in Italy is 12.4 percent, and yet immigrants from
Africa and Asia come ashore at the rate of 50,000 a year. Although
90,000 foreigners were legally registered in October 1987,
unofficial estimates put the number of illegal immigrants at
800,000. Racial animosity has risen in Italy along with the
immigration.
   Fini's party won 5.9 percent of the vote in parliamentary
elections last June. It holds 35 seats in the 630-member Chamber of
Deputies, making it Italy's fourth largest party, but it does not
figure prominently in the shaping of Italian governments or
policies.
   Even so, foreign workers are an issue in Italy. The largest
daily newspaper, La Repubblica, published a survey in early May of
high school students that it said indicated ``open hostility''
toward immigrants.
   Seventy percent of those responding said they would favor a
partial or total closing of borders to foreigners who ``rob us of
work.''
   In France, an intellectual ``new right'' is providing a
theoretical framework for neo-fascism. So-called revisionist
historians are publishing works that re-examine the country under
Nazi occupation and question whether the extermination of 6 million
Jews during World War II actually occurred.
   Le Pen referred to the gassing of Jews in Nazi death camps as
``a detail of history.''
   Similarly in Italy, a spate of books and articles is reassessing
the Italy of dictator Benito Mussolini in the years before and
during World War II. A leading Mussolini historian has suggested
that ``laws forbidding the re-establishment of the Fascist Party
are anachronistic.''
   Le Pen visited Rome on May 8, taking his message to a cheering
crowd at an Italian Social Movement meeting. He plans similar trips
around Europe in the coming months, said his spokesman Alain Vizier.
   But Le Pen's presence already has been felt abroad.
   Mogens Glistrip, leader of the Denmark's anti-immigration
Progress Party, is frequently referred to in the press as the local
Le Pen.
   In Danish parliamentary elections in May, Glistrip's party took
16 of the legislature's 179 seats, up from 9. It was the second big
gain in a row for the party, which had increased its holdings from
6 in another election last September.
   Norway's Carl I. Hagen also is compared to Le Pen. He leads the
Norwegian branch of the Progress Party that won 12.2 percent of the
popular vote in local elections last fall. Recent opinion polls
give the party 15 to 23 percent, making it Norway's second largest
party after the governing Labor Party.
   Hagen advocates limiting immigration based on the availablity of
housing and jobs.
   Political analyst Ole Borre of Denmark's Aarhus University said
the swing to the right in Denmark and Norway is part ``of an
international trend.''
   Some observers contend Le Pen's success is unique, a product of
the two-tier French election process and the candidate's
personality.
   Greece's Dimitriades says groups like his pose no immediate
challenge to existing European democracies.
   ``There is a swing toward conservatism in Europe,'' Dimitriades
said, ``but it's too early to say if it is swinging into our
sphere.''

   A backlash against Third World immigrants, along
with incidents of anti-Semitism, has caused serious concern about
racism in Italy and provoked a flood of commentaries in the
national media.
   In a recent highly publicized incident, an African-born woman
was chased off a bus in Rome by a crowd after one passenger told
her to ``leave the seats to the whites.''
   Other cases of hostility have been reported toward refugees,
Gypsies and Jews.
   The incidents have raised the question of whether Italy is
feeling the effects of the anti-immigrant movement in neighboring
France led by extreme right-wing politician Jean-Marie Le Pen.
   Italy has an estimated 800,000 immigrants from developing
countries, mainly in Africa and the Far East. Only 90,000 are
legally registered, according to the Interior Ministry.
   ``For the first time in history Italy has become a country
capable of attracting foreign labor,'' said sociologist Franco
Ferrarotti. ``We're not used to that or equipped for that.''
   He contends that Italians are not racist by nature, that ``in
general they have a terrific amount of tolerance, verging on
indifference.'' But he said Italians are becoming increasingly
prone to racial discrimination, partly as a result of the nation's
12.4 percent unemployment rate.
   ``There is a growing amount of social discrimination based on
ethnic perceptions, mostly motivated by a feeling of scarcity of
jobs,'' Ferrarotti said in an interview. ``Italians are haunted by
the ghost of unemployment.''
   But countering the argument that immigrants are stealing jobs is
the fact that they usually take work that Italians don't want.
   ``They quickly go to the bottom of the pile,'' Ferrarotti said.
``They're lucky if they end up washing cars.''
   For Italians, racism has long been considered someone else's
problem. Newspapers have reported extensively on racial troubles in
the United States and France.
   Italian media, nevertheless, display an obsession with racial
differences, gratuitously referring to non-whites by their race _
often as ``uomo di colore'' (colored man). Newspapers have run
headlines such as ``Oro Nero'' (Black Gold) on stories about black
Olympic athletes winning gold medals, or ``Pericolo Giallo''
(Yellow Peril) about rival Asian soccer teams.
   The case that brought the issue close to home involved the woman
on the bus, 37-year-old Amete Debretzion, a refugee from war-torn
Eritrea province in Ethiopia.
   The woman, who has lived in Italy for 14 years and is an Italian
citizen, said she was sitting in the bus with her child on her lap
when a man approached her and said, ``Get u, negress, leave the
seats to the whites.''
   Mrs. Debretzion said virtually all the other passengers
supported the man, joining in with their own racial slurs and
comments such as ``get out of Italy.'' She got off the bus.
   She appeared a few weeks later on national television to accept
personal apologies from Mayor Nicola Signorello of Rome.
   Only a few days before the bus incident, newspapers published a
survey of Rome high school students showing that 70 percent favored
the closure of Italy's borders to immigrants.
   Of the 5,500 polled, 26.3 percent said immigrants ``steal
jobs,'' 24.2 percent said they are ``terrorists,'' 6.1 percent
described them as ``thieves'' and ``drug pushers,'' and 2.6 percent
said they carry diseases. Five percent of the students openly
declared themselves ``racist.''
   Yousef Salman, leader of the Federation of the Organization of
Foreigners' Communities in Italy, attributes the rise in racial
incidents on people who blame immigrants for all of society's ills.
   ``You always have the image of the poor, sick African coming to
steal work,'' said Salman, who came to Italy 15 years ago from
Jordan as a student. ``But there are foreigners with energy and
capacities that should not be overlooked. There are doctors,
lawyers, engineers, men of culture and science, who have helped
Italy economically.''
   Recent incidents of anti-Semitism _ death threats, painting of
swastikas on walls and the bombing of a Jewish bookstore in Turin _
have alarmed Italy's Jewish community of 40,000 and strained
relations with the Roman Catholic Church.
   Jewish leaders have charged that the Italian press, including
Catholic publications, have helped incite anti-Semitism through
their reporting on Israel's policies toward the Palestinians.
   Italy's Roman Catholic bishops responded with a public letter
condemning anti-Semitism and urging Catholics to distinguish
between the Jewish people and the policies of the Israeli
government and political parties.
   Romans have also displayed hostility toward the 3,000 Gypsies
living in makeshift housing around the city. For more than a month
last year, residents camped out on railroad tracks and set up
burning roadblocks to protest city plans to establish encampments
for Gypsies in their neighborhoods.
   Last year, the government passed an amnesty law for illegal
aliens. If foreigners came forward to register themselves, they
would be given a residence permit and granted the same rights and
benefits as Italian citizens.
   Only 90,000 of the 800,000 immigrants registered; most preferred
to stay underground rather than risk losing their jobs with
employers unwilling to make the required social security payments.
   Most immigrants coming to Italy stay for only a few years to
earn some money before returning to their homelands.
   Ferrarotti, the sociologist, maintained that a movement like Le
Pen's in France would not find broad support in Italy because
Italians don't have the French's strong sense of nationalistic
identity.
   But Salman said Le Pen ``has given life to hidden feelings''
against foreigners in Italy.

<HEAD>Memorial Day Migration Starts the Hunt for Summer Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HYANNIS, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long before Cape Cod's annual summer
tourist migration started this Memorial Day weekend, resort
operators had put aside weather almanacs for want-ads.
   Their big concern: finding enough help.
   ``If you don't get good service, you don't have a good vacation
_ you have hell,'' said Walter Goodwin, owner of the 400-seat
Grandma's Restaurant in Bourne.
   Already, employers are making special arrangements to hire
foreign workers from as far away as Brazil and the Philippines, and
college students and older people from Colorado and Texas are
arriving by the score to claim the jobs.
   Even so, there are too few hands to go around, and the problem
is not new. Goodwin said he lost $8,000 a week last summer when he
had to shut part of his dining room. He could not calculate how
much was lost due to over-worked and short-tempered waitresses.
   Over at the 261-room Sheraton Hyannis, night manager Edward
Dennis sometimes finds himself pushing a vacuum cleaner and working
in the kitchen just to keep things moving.
   ``We're getting busier, but the help situation is getting
worse,'' said Dennis. ``If it doesn't get any better, people coming
down to the Cape aren't going to come back. You can't just start
giving excuses to the guests.''
   The problem is even hitting the beaches. In Orleans, a shortage
of lifeguards might restrict swimming and crimp parking revenues.
   The problem comes as no surprise: nationwide, the pool of
prospective workers aged 17-25, usually college students, is
shrinking; and on the Cape, the steep cost of housing, with monthly
rents starting at $600, scares many away.
   But local restaurateurs, hoteliers and others in the leisure
industry were galvanized into action by a report last November that
said 14,000 seasonal and year-round jobs on the Cape and nearby
islands went vacant last year. The list included spots that
employers would have created if workers had been available. The
report estimated the worker shortage translated into $47 million in
lost revenue.
   ``There is now widespread fear that the traditional peak
(May-October) will bring ruinous results in 1988,'' said the report
by the Cape and Islands Labor Shortage Task Force. Based on a
survey of 254 businesses, the report on labor trends was
commissioned by a coalition of the New Bedford, Cape Cod and
Islands Private Industry Council, the Office for Job Partnerships,
and the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce.
   In an effort to find workers and keep them, business groups this
year held job fairs, instituted one-stop job shops that offer
employment plus housing and appealed to local residents to open
their homes. There also were mass mailings to colleges and
universities in the Midwest and Southwest, said Michael Frucci,
executive director of the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce.
   Some took action on their own: motels turned rooms into
dormitories, and one restaurant chain bought houses to convert into
worker dorms.
   A Hyannis company is offering to untangle the red tape to allow
Brazilians to get temporary work permits and restaurants and hotels
to legally employ them.
   Local employment specialists estimate at least 3,000 foreigners,
chiefly Brazilian and Irish, are already working illegally on Cape
Cod, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service says it will
crack down this summer.
   ``The honeymoon is over as far as the Cape is concerned,'' said
Timothy Whelan, deputy director of the Boston INS office.
   A one-year grace period began last June 1, when citations were
issued to employers found using illegal aliens. Starting Wednesday,
employers risk fines of $250 to $10,000 per employee for repeated
offenses. After the third offense, they risk criminal charges.
   Employers can apply for temporary certificates to employ
foreigners for seasonal work if they can prove no Americans can be
found to do the job. Whelan said the INS had received 600-700
applications for the certificates, which must also go through the
Department of Labor, and most were approved.
   But there still is housing to contend with.
   When Goodwin, the owner of Grandma's, counted up 50 job
vacancies for this summer and only 12 applicants, he bought a
$150,000 three-family home to house workers. He also made deals
with local motel owners. The motels will rent their $70-a-night
rooms to Goodwin's staffers for just $75 per person per week,
provided they do their own housekeeping.
   ``There's a little bit of desperation,'' Frucci said, noting
that inquiries from potential vacationers were up from last year.
He credited a robust economy in the East and the dollar's decline,
which makes a vacation at home more appealing than an overseas trip
and also lures Canadians over the border.
   Krista Hayes, employer services manager for the Office of Job
Partnerships, said she was encouraged by the results of efforts to
find workers.
   ``We showed the employers there are labor sources locally, and
out of state, we talked about labor certification for foreign
temporary summer workers,'' Mrs. Hayes said. ``Many have been
approved and have their foreign workers here. A lady from Colorado
has brought students here. I just can't help but say it's got to be
better than last year.''

   It's been getting more difficult
for William Erwin, general manager of Casino Pier, to find enough
local students to run the rides, arcade games and food concessions
each summer.
   This year, he found help in Ireland.
   Erwin is one of a growing number of resort employers who are
turning to foreign students to help fill in the gaps.
   In Ireland especially, where unemployment is near 21 percent,
students are more than ready to spend their summers operating a
Ferris wheel in Wildwood or pushing a rolling chair in Atlantic
City.
   ``Whereas a lot of American students take time off in the summer
to travel, the majority of students who come here on a visa have to
work to make money for schooling,'' said Cathy Burke, owner of the
Irish Pub in Atlantic City. She regularly hires several Irish
students for her restaurant and 100-room inn.
   ``They come here with a purpose and a good strong work ethic,''
she said. ``They're quality people.''
   To assist the students, many employers provide housing or help
them find rooms in local inns and rooming houses. Ms. Burke puts up
many of her foreign students at her inn.
   ``It's kind of like Ellis Island around here,'' she said.
   Several agencies in the United States and abroad help foreign
students obtain visas to work for the summer and often provide
inexpensive chartered flights. Some employers, such as Erwin,
travel overseas to interview candidates and sign notes promising
jobs so they can obtain visas.
   Of the 600 seasonal employees at Casino Pier and the adjoining
Water Works water park, about 70 will come from Ireland, France and
Spain, Erwin said. They can legally arrive on June 1 and must leave
by Oct. 19, he said.
   The general manager of Mariner's Landing amusement pier in
Wildwood also regularly travels to Ireland to interview students.
   ``This year we expect to have about 75 foreign students out of
the 250 people we hire for our water park and pier,'' said
spokeswoman Jacqueline Palumbo. The students are from Israel,
Turkey, China, England and France.
   ``We would have no trouble getting American students because
we're in a great location,'' she said, ``but we've found that there
is a strong desire among foreign students to work here because they
are really in need of employment.''
   Not all seasonal employers at the seashore are willing to help
reduce unemployment in foreign countries, however. Ronald Stokes,
general manager of Stokes Laundry Inc. in Wildwood Crest, said he
concentrates his recruiting efforts on universities in this country.
   ``We've had Irish students before and they didn't last all
summer,'' he said. ``They like to take off the last two or three
weeks to travel. At least with college students here, you know they
leave around Labor Day.''
   In addition, Stokes said, many foreign students ``work two or
three jobs while they're here to make a lot of money, but then they
bug out and get tired. Yet they'll stay and visit this country
until their visas expire.''
   Larry E. Belfer, who hires many foreign students each summer to
push his Atlantic City Famous Rolling Chairs, says they often come
to the United States ``to learn the language ... and learn the
culture.''
   But Belfer has been so successful with his foreign students that
he has set up an agency to refer others to seasonal jobs in the
area; three casinos have already signed on.
   ``They can't work in the casino because it takes too long to get
licensed, but they can take jobs in the casino's hotel and
restaurants,'' Belfer said.
   ``Hopefully we'll have a nice little marriage here,'' he said.
``I'm not trying to take away from local labor, but this provides a
nice buffer for the summer crunch.''

<HEAD>INS Gets Tough Wednesday on Employers Who Hire Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After Tuesday, American businesses, from the
loftiest Fortune 500 company to the smallest corner grocery, won't
get just a warning the first time they're caught employing illegal
immigrants.
   Companies tempted to look the other way when illegal aliens
apply could face stiff fines, the real teeth in the landmark 1986
immigration reform bill that enters a new phase June 1.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service will target key
industries, looking for violators.
   It is a system that has worked in Europe, and many feel it
offers the best hope to curb illegal immigration and transfer jobs
from aliens to U.S. citizens.
   But others worry about possible exploitation of illegal workers,
discrimination against foreign-appearing workers, the impact on the
labor force and the dangers of turning employers into immigration
police.
   Doris Meissner, a former acting INS commissioner, questions
whether employer sanctions might ``put into our employment
practices a bias toward looking at people's foreignness that never
existed before.''
   It may be too early to gauge whether that is true, but the
monetary impact will certainly be felt right away.
   After Wednesday, the INS need no longer issue an initial warning
citation to employers who hire undocumented workers. The law now
requires employers to obtain documents from workers showing they
are legally in this country.
   Employers face fines of up to $1,000 for improper documentation,
up to $2,000 per alien for a first offense of knowingly hiring an
illegal alien, up to $5,000 per alien for the second offense,
$10,000 for subsequent offenses, and $3,000 or six months in jail
for a ``pattern or practice'' of violation.
   Over the past year, INS fined 80 businesses $350,000 and gave
2,000 citations. The agency thus views the new phase not as a
dramatic crackdown, but as a nudge to employers. The fines went to
companies that got warnings but continued ignoring the law.
   ``Our intent is not to indiscriminately run around fining
employers. The intent is to encourage employers to validate their
work force,'' says INS spokesman Duke Austin. ``It'll be a
deliberate implementation of the law.''
   Although INS is beefing up its investigative force, agents will
not be able to inspect every business. Austin says the agency will
use its resources ``judiciously,'' targeting the construction,
garment and hotel and service industries that have traditionally
been repositories of illegal workers.
   In Europe, where many countries adopted employer sanctions a
decade ago, the system did not trigger widespread job
discrimination against foreigners, according to a 1987 study by the
Center for Immigration Studies, a private think tank that
researches immigration trends.
   The study concluded that cooperation by employers is vital for
such a system and said employers would cooperate if the paperwork
wasn't burdensome and if enforcement was consistent and certain.
   ``It's got to take on the aura of the IRS,'' says Vernon M.
Briggs Jr., a labor economist at Cornell University. ``Most people
are probably reasonably honest in doing their income tax because
there's a fair chance they're going to get caught. Everybody
worries about the IRS but I don't think anybody is worried about
the INS yet.''
   Businesses were skeptical last year about the I-9 forms they
were required to fill out for workers, a new and costly level of
paperwork. Now, they seem less resistant, if still wary.
   Virginia Lamp Thomas, labor attorney for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, says businesses are ``afraid that the law has significant
teeth in it.''
   The chamber is conducting a survey to determine how the law is
working. Some experts have made preliminary assessments.
   ``Employer sanctions will probably work best in the larger firms
and will work least effectively as you get down to the mom and pop
enterprises that don't pay much anyhow and need the cheap (illegal)
labor to survive,'' says David Simcox, director of the Center for
Immigration Studies.
   Briggs, the labor economist, says employer sanctions probably
will not be very effective because employers really don't have to
verify the worker's documents.
   ``Anything that a worker shows an employer that appears to be
reasonable essentially takes the employers off the hook. I think
it's likely to make a mockery out of the ability to enforce the
bill,'' he says.
   The amnesty phase of the law, in which illegal aliens who came
to the United States before 1982 could apply for temporary
residency, enlarged the pool of legal workers available for
low-paying jobs.
   Employers ``have got the windfall of having additional pools of
low-wage workers, which means they don't have to modernize or raise
wages in order to make jobs more attractive,'' Briggs says.
   The potential for worker exploitation concerns civil liberties
advocates.
   The law ``grandfathered'' in workers who had jobs on Nov. 6,
1986, the date it was passed. That means that employers did not
have to ask those workers for documents, although illegal workers
in that category remain subject to deportation if caught by INS.
Now, the worry is that those workers can be trapped in their jobs
with no redress against an unscrupulous employer.
   ``Obviously for these employees it totally removes their ability
to make any kind of changes. If there is a bad employment situation
they'd be very reluctant to change jobs because they don't have
documents. It sets up a situation amenable to exploitation,'' says
Meissner, now with the Carneigie Endowment for International Peace,
which studies foreign policy issues.
   There is also the issue of job discrimination. The law bars
employers from refusing to hire someone because of their national
origin or, in the case of someone who has taken steps to become a
citizen, his citizenship status. It sets up a special Justice
Department counsel to prosecute complaints.
   So far, 139 discrimination allegations have been filed with that
office. Forty-eight have been resolved or are being investigated.
Of those, 15 have resulted in formal complaints and 10 have been
settled by requiring back pay with offers of employment.
   But that may not tell the whole story. The law also allows
employers to hire U.S. citizens over non-citizens ``if the two
individuals are equally qualified.''
   ``That's going to make it even more difficult to prove
discrimination. `Equally qualified' is to a certain degree
subjective,'' says Mario Moreno, of the Mexican-American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, which provides legal assistance to
Mexican-Americans and others involved in employment discrimination
suits or complaints.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative branch of
Congress, last fall found little evidence that employers were
discriminating against foreign-looking job applicants because of
the new law. But those findings are only preliminary.
   The law was intended to discourage illegal immmigration by
drying up the job prospects for such aliens. Whether that will
happen remains to be seen.
   ``There will be some job market for illegals because there will
be employers who won't comply,' says Meissner. ``The question then
becomes to what extent over time does the government's effort bring
about real voluntary compliance on the part of employers and some
deterrence.''

   Recent events on Wall Street have taken a lot of
the suspense out of the various periodic government reports on the
state of the economy.
   Followers of the stock market are familiar with the usual
routine: Investors set their sights on a forthcoming report
regarding something like the trade deficit and try to anticipate
what it will look like.
   If, when the number arrives, it is better than expected, stock
prices rally. If it falls short of expectations, the market falls.
   The exercise can get convoluted at times, on the theory that
what looks good for the current economy might actually be an
ominous portent for interest rates, inflation and the business
outlook at some point in the future.
   Lately, however, the game has been simplified. If the trade
deficit rises, stocks fall. If the trade deficit narrows, well,
stocks also fall.
   As Jack Lavery, research director at Merrill Lynch, put it
recently: ``Good news is bad news and bad news is bad news.''
   However perverse that may sound, long-time students of the stock
market say it is neither unprecedented nor illogical.
   The relationship between stocks and the economic news is often
tenuous, they say. If investors are sufficiently fearful, they may
well find an ostensibly positive development uninspiring.
   In fact, traders who want to lighten their stock holdings may
seize on ``good news'' as an opportune moment to sell.
   John Mendelson, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said he
was surprised by the number of puzzled queries that arose when the
stock market fell May 17 even though the Commerce Department
reported that the trade deficit shrank to $9.75 billion in March.
   ``In our view,'' he said, ``the message of the tape was simply
that this is a bear market.''
   Added Thom Brown, chairman of the investment policy committee at
Butcher & Singer Inc. in Philadelphia:
   ``Today, as in most earlier bear markets, investors are ignoring
the positive factors on the fundamental front. For example,
earnings for most of the basic industry companies are good and
getting better.
   ``But it doesn't necessarily follow that this strength will be
reflected in stock prices near term.''
   For a precedent of this sort of thing, Brown cited the behavior
of the stock of Bethlehem Steel in 1973 and 1974, when the market
suffered through a long period of disfavor.
   At the end of 1972, when Bethlehem posted earnings of $3.02 a
share and paid $1.20 a share in dividends, the stock stood at about
$30, he recalled.
   At the end of 1974, when the company's earnings climbed to $7.85
a share and the dividend to $2.30, the stock was down to $23.
   ``The lesson here is obvious. During a bull market, surprises in
stock prices are likely to be on the upside. In bear markets, the
reverse is usually the case,'' Brown said.
   With all the woes bear markets may bring, Brown and other
analysts observe, they may also present special opportunities for
long-term investors.
   After all, the ideal time to buy stocks in the past has been
when their prices were depressed, especially when bear markets have
gone to extremes.
   Spotting these special ``buying opportunities'' is no easy
assignment, as most market-watchers readily concede. By the time a
bear market gets close to a bottom, the economic news often looks
so bad that hardly anybody wants even to consider buying stocks.
   Still, one signal many Wall Streeters watch for as a likely
portent that a bear market is ending: When the stock market stops
paying attention to ``bad news,'' or even starts finding ways to
interpret it as positive.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Seems Ready to Ease Curbs on Russian Orthodox Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appears to
be moving toward significant easing of restrictions on the Russian
Orthodox Church on its 1,000th anniversary this year, according to
U.S. and Canadian experts on Soviet religious affairs.
   It is unclear, however, whether Gorbachev's new way of dealing
with the Orthodox Church signals substantially improved conditions
for other religious groups in the Soviet Union.
   On Monday, during his summit visit, President Reagan was
scheduled to visit the Danilov Monastery outside Moscow, seat of
the Orthodox Church's patriarchate, ``to symbolize our concern for
religious freedom,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Word reached the presidential party late last week in Helsinki,
Finland, that the Soviets had questioned the participation of one
of the religious groups that are to meet with Reagan at the
monastery. Fitzwater said he did not know which religious group
prompted the Soviet objection. The meeting, he said, ``is still on
as far as I know.''
   Reagan recently cited ``the first signs of progress'' toward
religious freedom in the Soviet Union.
   He noted that some religious dissidents have been allowed to
emigrate, some new churches have been organized and Soviet
authorities have announced they will permit the printing of 100,000
Bibles.
   ``These are encouraging signs and we welcome them,'' the
president told a White House conference May 3. ``What we hope for
ultimately is a willingness to see continued change, in the spirit
of glasnost, when it comes to matters of religion.''
   Peter Reddaway, director of the Kennan Institute for Advanced
Russian Studies in Washington, said he is impressed by Gorbachev's
meeting with leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church on April 29 to
appeal for their support.
   Reddaway said it apparently was the first such meeting since
1943, when Stalin conferred with church leaders to help rally the
country against Nazi Germany during World War II.
   Taking part in the most recent Kremlin session were Patriarch
Pimen, head of the Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Filaret of Kiev
and Galitsky and other members of the holy synod, the church's
governing body.
   Gorbachev told them that a new law on ``freedom of conscience''
was being drafted to reflect the ``tangible results of new
approaches to state-church relations in the conditions of
perestroika and democratization.''
   Details of the new law have not been announced.
   Reddaway said there are indications that the new statute will
include removing the ban on the church's involvement in charitable
activities.
   ``If that is indeed the case, then to my mind it's quite a
significant _ and possibly even very significant _ shift in
official policy,'' he said.
   Reddaway said that when he visited Moscow in January, he learned
that the Russian Republic's minister of health had called in
representatives of churches in Moscow and told them ``the time had
come for the churches to exercise their charitable urges.''
   The Soviet official ``proposed that each of them should adopt a
major Moscow hospital and provide basic services to patients in
that hospital. Apparently the church leaders agreed. This is rather
remarkable,'' Reddaway said.
   As for other religious denominations, Reddaway said ``there are
some signs that these still-illegal groups are being tolerated, de
facto, more than in the past _ even the Ukrainian Catholics, who
are the biggest single outlawed church.''
   Unofficial estimates of the number of religious believers in the
Soviet Union put the total at upwards of 90 million people. This
includes 40 million to 50 million adherents of the Russian Orthodox
Church, 10 million Eastern Rite and Roman Catholics; 4 million
Protestants, including Baptists and Pentecostalists; 2 million
Jews, and tens of millions of Moslems.
   Bohdan Bociurkiw, a political science professor at Carleton
University in Ottawa, said church-state relations under Gorbachev
have dramatically improved for the Orthodox Church but have ``not
improved in relationship to most other churches.''
   He said ``the main linkage between the regime and the (Orthodox)
Church is mutual perception of common national interest.''
   ``Gorbachev is courting Russian nationalists, he's courting
believers, but he would not make concessions to churches that he
views as centrifugal _ that would not fit into that notion of
Russian national interest,'' Bociurkiw said. ``It's not a change in
principle, but it's a pragmatic change in policy.''
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the New York-based World
Jewish Congress, said that for Soviet Jews, ``conditions are better
than they have been in the past, but there is certainly a long way
yet to go.''
   Steinberg said there has been a major increase in the number of
Soviet Jews being allowed to emigrate, from fewer than 1,000 in
1986 to about 10,000 in the past year, and greater access to Jewish
cultural and religious materials.
   He said World Jewish Congress officials recently had ``positive
and constructive'' talks in Moscow with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze about Soviet Jewry, the Middle East and
East-West relations.
   Kent Hill, director of the Institute on Religion and Democracy,
a Washington-based, non-profit research group, said an estimated
160 religious dissidents remain in Soviet labor camps or internal
exile, a decline of about 150 since January 1986.
   Hill said he sensed a relaxation of government restrictions
during a recent two-week visit to active churches in the Russian
Republic, the Ukraine, Latvia and Estonia, but a wary, skeptical
attitude among many Russian Orthodox and Protestant believers.
   Unlike some Western observers, he said, ``they are far more
cautious in making optimistic projections about the future.''
   ``First of all, they're not at all sure Gorbachev's position is
assured. They don't know how long he's going to be around,'' Hill
said.
   ``Another reason is that in the past they have seen these cycles
of relaxation be followed by renewed repression.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev may be general secretary
of the avowedly atheistic Soviet Communist Party, but that hasn't
stopped him from referring several times in recent months to God
and Jesus Christ.
   Gorbachev, whose mother is a regular churchgoer, used a biblical
allusion during a May 18 interview with The Washington Post and
Newsweek when seeking to explain the limits on his current drive to
restructure Soviet society.
   ``Jesus Christ alone knew answers to all questions and knew how
to feed 20,000 Jews with five loaves of bread,'' he said. ``We
don't possess that skill, we have no ready prescription to solve
all our problems quickly.''
   Last December, Gorbachev invoked God's name during summit talks
with President Reagan in Washington.
   The Soviet leader said his visit had augmented his knowledge
about the United States.
   ``We discussed with the president that it would be a good thing
to have more of an informal visit, to travel around the country ...
and I believe that if the Politburo and God are well disposed
toward me then I might do this without putting it off for too
long,'' he said.

<HEAD>Of Bribes and Men _ The Restaurant Rat List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just two weeks after the FBI charged 28 health
inspectors with extortion for threatening to add restaurants to the
city's notorious Rat List, several restaurateurs showed two can
play that game by trying to bribe their way off the list.
   About one-third of the city's health inspectors were indicted;
the FBI and the city's Department of Investigations found at least
300 of the city's 15,000 or so restaurants were solicited for
bribes just during its investigation.
   ``Some restaurant owners dreaded to see them coming, driving up
in Cadillacs and wearing Rolex watches,'' said James M. Fox, head
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the city.
   The Health Department was still stinging from the scandal when
some restaurateurs assumed the cozy hand-in-pocket relationship had
been only briefly suspended.
   ``Two weeks after all the notoriety about the inspection
scandals, six of our inspectors reported that restaurant managers
and owners tried to bribe them,'' said Marvin Bogner, the city's
assistant health commissioner.
   Noting that inspectors usually take off their suit coats and don
blue work jackets for inspections, Bogner said: ``One inspector
noticed the restaurateur putting a wad of bills in his coat pocket.
   ``The inspector took the wad of bills and threw it on the
kitchen floor.''
   The bribe attempts, offered in late April, involved ``a wide
spectrum of restaurants'' ranging from beaneries to bistros, said
Bogner. He would not name any because the Department of
Investigations is looking into the reports.
   The most obvious public effect of the crackdown by the FBI and
the city has been that newspapers stopped publishing the city
Health Department's Rat List, officially and more politely called
the list of ``Food Inspection Results.''
   The newspapers said they could not be sure if a restaurant had a
legitimate sanitation problem or if the owner had merely resisted
extortion by health inspectors.
   New York gourmets and gourmands had scanned The New York Times,
Newsday and the Daily News weekly with mingled horror and
fascination, fearing that their favorite eatery would be listed
after they enjoyed a meal there.
   A few typical examples:
   _ A restaurant that, among other violations, had ``mouse
droppings, flies, (and an) employee smoking while serving.''
   _ A bakery cited for having ``nail-polish remover, motorcycle
oil, peroxide, paints, cough medicines and insecticides on shelves
near food.''
   _ Greenwich Street's Pussycat Lounge, for _ of course _ ``cats
kept on premises.'' Perhaps it is not a coincidence that the
restaurants cited for having cats had no rodent droppings, and vice
versa.
   _ A few ``power lunch'' spots, where the city's movers and
shakers talk big business, have also received violation notices.
   In 1982, Mimi Sheraton, then the Times' restaurant reviewer,
raved about the ``satiny'' vinaigrette dressing and ``bracing''
golden consomme at La Cote Basque, giving it a three-star rating.
   The Health Department panned La Cote Basque in 1984, citing its
``slime-laden'' ice cream machine and ``greasy'' floor. At the
time, the prix fixe luncheon cost $25.
   The Rat List wasn't always so specific. Until last autumn, it
just named offending restaurants without citing whether they had
cats, rats or were simply missing necessary operating permits.
   A New York Times spokeswoman said editors decided to change the
format of the weekly list to help readers distinguish between major
and minor health violations.
   The satirical monthly magazine ``Spy'' beat all the dailies by a
year by providing the real dirt on the city's restaurants beginning
in October 1986, said Joe Mastriani, the editor in charge of the
column.
   ``It was a pretty popular feature,'' he added, but ``Spy''
dropped it last fall when the newspapers began running the new,
comprehensive Rat List.
   The new full-disclosure policy ended in late March when the FBI
charged that the 28 current and former Health Department inspectors
had doubled and tripled their annual salaries of $25,000 to $30,000
through extortion.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Veteran AP reporter Bob Thomas covered the
victory party that ended in death for Robert Kennedy. Here he
recalls that night.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a luncheon in the Empire Room of the
Ambassador Hotel recently, I stopped at the passageway to the
kitchen.
   A bus boy was piling dishes, and the thought was inescapable:
what a homely place for an event that changed the course of a
nation.
   Toward midnight on June 4, 1968, I was in the press room
adjacent to the Empire Room. My assignment for the AP the night of
the California presidential primary was to cover the leading
Democratic contender, Robert F. Kennedy.
   The polls had already reported an overwhelming victory for the
New York senator, and Kennedy made his acceptance with customary
eloquence in the Empire Room.
   Next, he would cut through the kitchen to the press room to
answer reporters' questions, but as I waited near the kitchen door
there was a series of sharp reports, like balloons popping.
   Then screams. I rushed toward them.
   It was a scene of terror. Women were wailing, men yelling. The
noise reverberated so loudly that I couldn't tell what anyone was
shouting.
   In a corner I could see the athletes Rafer Johnson and Rosey
Grier struggling with someone. I had no sense of danger, still not
grasping the reason for the popping sounds. I felt detached,
watching the panic as if it were a vivid movie scene.
   A cluster of people stood in the center of the room, peering
down with horrified faces. I couldn't see what they were looking
at. I jumped up on a stack of kitchen trays.
   Robert Kennedy lay on the floor, blood streaming from his head,
blank eyes staring into the void.
   After gathering in the nightmarish scene, I jumped down and
rushed to a press room phone. It was dead! I ran into the hotel
lobby, where I knew there was a row of phone booths. I slipped a
dime into the first phone and couldn't get a dial tone. Finally, I
was able to reach the office.
   Bob Myers, AP's San Francisco bureau chief who was helping out
in Los Angeles, answered. This is the conversation as he later
related (I don't remember it):
   Thomas: I got a flash. Kennedy shot.
   Myers: Are you serious?
   Thomas: I'm serious. Kennedy's been shot. ...
   Myers: Did you see it?
   Thomas: No, but I saw him lying on the floor.
   Myers: You're sure? What exactly did you see?
   Thomas: Kennedy lying on the floor of the kitchen hall with
blood all over his face. He had been shot.
   As I was dictating the story, I heard a commotion in the lobby.
   Leaning out of the telephone booth, I could see a phalanx of Los
Angeles policemen hurrying a young man down the marble staircase
right in front of me. I returned to the phone and gave a
description of the man who turned out to be Sirhan Sirhan.
   After all the dictation, I put down the phone with a feeling of
emptiness and sorrow. I walked dazedly toward the kitchen, but a
policeman blocked the entrance to a place that was now part of
history.

<HEAD>Conspiracy Theories: Incomplete Files, Woman in Polka Dot Dress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DARTMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Robert F. Kennedy was shot 20 years ago
as dozens of people stood within arm's reach of the assassin. Yet,
even with all those witnesses, many still insist there was more to
it than the solitary act of the gunman.
   The FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department have concluded the
murder was the work of one man.
   But conspiracy theorists point to incomplete police files and
suggest that a second gunman fired at Kennedy from behind, while
Sirhan Sirhan stood in front of him. They cite witnesses who
claimed that Sirhan was seen with an unidentified young woman in a
polka dot dress shortly before the shooting.
   Those believing in conspiracy turn up regularly at a small
walled-off section of the Southeastern Massachusetts University
library, home of the Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Archives, the
largest collection of its kind.
   ``The majority of people who come to us for information already
embrace a notion of conspiracy of some kind,'' said Phillip H.
Melanson, a political science professor at the university who also
heads the archives.
   The archives contain the 10,000-page transcript of Sirhan's
trial and thousands of pages of district attorney's files. Melanson
and his staff have 8,000 pages of the recently declassified
32,000-page FBI file of the investigation into the murder and are
getting the rest. Add to those 600 hours of audio tape and 5,000
newspaper clippings.
   Melanson believes Sirhan did not act alone. He and other
scholars have been critical of the Los Angeles police
investigation, suggesting it was haphazard and resulted in the
destruction of key evidence.
   In April, Melanson said only 400 hours of testimony remained
preserved on tape in Los Angeles police files, although
investigators earlier had spoken of thousands of hours of taped
interviews.
   ``History may have dictated keeping those longer, but I was not
consulted,'' said Tom Reddin, Los Angeles police chief at the time
of the assassination, who dismisses suggestions of a coverup.
   ``The question you have to ask,'' he said, ``is, `What the devil
are we trying to cover up?'''
   His deepest regret, Reddin said, is that someone did not step in
to keep Kennedy from entering the Ambassador Hotel kitchen where
Sirhan lay in wait.
   Kennedy's entourage insisted on no police protection for his
appearances in Los Angeles, and no police were present at the
hotel. Asked whether the police should have disregarded the
request, Reddin said sadly, ``I don't think we should have, but I
wish we did.''
   Even Melanson acknowledged that some of those who share his view
that Sirhan did not act alone lack convincing arguments.
   ``Certainly there is a group of people who embrace conspiracy
out of perhaps devotion to the political figure,'' said Melanson.
   Social scientist John Clarke of the University of Arizona at
Tucson perceived psychological needs behind conspiracy theories.
   Noting the ``charismatic appeal'' of leaders like RFK and his
brother John F. Kennedy, Clarke said, ``That's why a certain number
of people don't want to let these people go _ and this curiosity
about who killed these people is one handle they have on that.''
   For a tragedy of such magnitude, it may be only natural to
question simple explanations. ``There has got to be a much more
elaborate background of conspiracy. The common error lies in making
more complex what are simple events,'' said Franklin L. Ford, a
Harvard University history professor.
   Added Ford, author of ``Political Murder: From Tyrannicide to
Terrorism,'' ``It is possible to order a mail-order high-velocity
rifle to kill the president of the United States _ but the public
doesn't accept that.''

   At 2 in the morning one day three
years ago, Barbara McFalls marched up to the door of a crack house
and demanded her daughter.
   If McFalls thought she'd left gangs and drugs behind when she
moved from East Los Angeles 14 years before, the horrible truth
came home that night. The daughter, now a successful career woman,
never returned to that scene, but the mother did _ picketing crack
houses, lecturing gang members and trying to save the children of
people who didn't care enough to do it themselves.
   ``We've got the LA connection, and it's bad,'' said McFalls, who
lives in the Meadowview neighborhood on Sacramento's south side.
   ``For Sale'' signs line her street, but McFalls has no intention
of running. Instead, she breaks up fights, corrals gang members to
help register voters and urges witnesses to gang violence to
testify. She persuaded two gang members wanted for crimes to
surrender, driving one to juvenile hall herself, and baked sweet
potato pies at the request of another who was being shipped to the
California Youth Authority.
   ``I get out there face to face with them. That's the only way
you can deal with them. And they respect you for it, too,'' said
McFalls, who walks amid the Bloods' red and the Crips' blue with
her own colors, the black and yellow of the Meadowview Improvement
Committee.
   ``You just can't be scared. You have to leave your fear tucked
away somewhere. If you let them know you don't like what's going on
in your neighborhood, they'll move.''
   Some 550 miles north on Interstate 5, Irine Tate never stops
letting them know how she feels. One day last winter, she painted
``NO DRUG PARKING'' in white block letters down the middle of her
Portland, Ore., street, on all four corners, along her retaining
wall and on her neighbor's garage door.
   ``They said, `We live around here, we pay rent.' I said, `You
don't pay no damn rent around here! So get the hell off my block!'''
   The gang members didn't like the dead-honest, drug-hating Tate,
but they had to respect her. She'd sit on her porch and watch their
comings and goings, listen to their deals and learn all she could.
Then she'd call the police, something her neighbors were afraid to
do.
   Tate and McFalls realize the risks they take in opposing the
lucrative drug trade. McFalls has a ``panic box'' in her home: push
the button and police surround her block within two minutes.
   Tate owns a bullet-proof vest. One day a gang member told her it
wouldn't do any good. ``We've got armor-piercing bullets,'' he
said. ``If we want you bad enough, we'll get you.''
   So far, the gangs haven't wanted to hurt either woman, both of
whom temper fear with faith. ``If God wants you to die, then you
die,'' Tate said. ``If God wants me to die with them shooting me,
then I'm going to die with them shooting me.''
   One Crip tried to buy her silence for $10,000, but she wasn't
selling.
   ``I could have paid my bills off and been sitting pretty if I'd
taken that money,'' she said over the drone of a TV soap opera.
``And whose life would I have ruined?
   ``I'd lose my own self-respect. I'd lose my dignity, my pride in
myself. And what would the kids think of me?''
   The kids see all, hear all. They know who's cooking, who's
selling and how much they're asking. Kids as young as 6 have become
lookouts and shills who steer crack customers to one gang's house
and away from a rival's.
   The answer, say McFalls and Ed Elmore, another member of the
Meadowview Improvement Committee, is to give kids guidance and
alternatives. Give them jobs in the summer and places to go besides
the streets. Put back into the community the money and hope that
crack dealers take out.
   A year ago, McFalls' street was crowded with gang members
dealing crack as openly as if they were selling T-shirts or
hamburgers. Now they've retreated indoors, paying rent to single
mothers and old people willing to turn their homes into crack
houses.
   Four California gang members moved in with one of Tate's
neighbors, and the young mother now smokes crack and wonders how to
get rid of her roommates. McFalls gets phone calls in the wee hours
from a woman who became an addict, gave birth to a one-pound baby
and now hears disembodied voices as she aimlessly rides buses
around the West.
   ``Don't you realize what you're doing to your own people?'' an
infuriated Tate once asked a gang member. ``You're ruining their
minds so they don't know how to think. You're killing them.''
   The Crip sat thinking for a long time. ``I guess you're right,''
he told her later. ``But I may as well be making the money as
somebody else.''

   As the crash of 1987 recedes into memory, Wall
Streeters are sounding a new lament: The stock market is too quiet.
   Fear of the volatility that rocked the markets last fall and in
early 1988 appears to have created a kind of paralysis, leaving
brokers sitting by idle telephones while their customers watch and
wait.
   By all accounts, the crash frightened away not only individual
investors but also professional managers who work for pensions
funds and other large pools of money.
   In congressional testimony this past week, David Ruder, chairman
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said institutional money
managers were suffering from ``great fear about volatility.''
   Through May 24, trading volume this year on the New York Stock
Exchange is running 6.4 percent behind its pace in 1987. At the
American Stock Exchange, the dropoff has been 27.1 percent.
   Last Monday, when 102.64 million shares were traded, was the
quietest session not affected by a holiday at the Big Board in
nearly a year and a half.
   The story is much the same in the bond market, where inflation
worries have intensified the post-crash blues. David Resler,
economist at Nomura Securities International, recently calculated
that customer transactions for primary dealers in U.S. government
securities were down 22 percent from their 1987 rate.
   The way many analysts see it, the outlook doesn't look good for
an improvement in this situation any time soon, with the ``dog
days'' of summer approaching.
   ``From now through Labor Day, anyway, it's going to be dull,''
said Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
   In such a climate, morale on Wall Street is naturally low. The
Wall Street Journal reports that one major investment firm, Kidder,
Peabody & Co., is considering putting some of its traders on a
four-day work week this summer, although the firm denies that.
   ``By their very nature, traders want immediate gratification,''
observed William King, head of equity trading at Nikko Securities
International.
   ``In bull markets, there is plenty of that, with abundant
activity and many stories. But bear markets see little activity and
less information.
   ``Traders give up quickly on their positions. That is why we see
such sleepy trading rooms.''
   Viewed from a historical perspective, the numbers might not
appear to warrant so much gloom. Although average volume on the
NYSE reached 188.94 million shares in 1987, it averaged less than
100 million shares a day as recently as 1984. Ten years ago, it was
less than 30 million shares.
   So a casual observer might regard the current slump as no more
than a modest retrenchment after a long period of explosive growth.
   In truth, Wall Streeters, like people in a good many other
businesses, are known for a tendency to hyperbole when they talk
about their problems.
   But analysts also point out that the recent slowdown is a very
real threat to jobs and profits in an industry that had expanded
its staff, facilities, plans and ambitions through the long 1982-87
bull market.
   According to the Labor Department, employment in the securities
industry grew from 243,700 at the end of 1980 to 453,500 seven
years later.
   ``When volume is down and expenses keep rising, firms really get
stung,'' said DeVoe.
   Matthew Drennan, a New York University professor, noted in a
study released this past week that the New York securities industry
had lost 8,000 jobs since the crash and could lose 18,000 more by
the end of this year.
   For the stock market and the investors who participate in it, a
decline in Big Board trading volume has traditionally meant trouble.
   The last time it happened was 1977, when the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials fell 17 percent in a year generally characterized
as ``mixed.''
   Before that, volume shrank in 1974, 1973, 1969 and 1962, all of
which witnessed significant declines in stock prices.
   The scariest periods for investors may be violent selloffs on
huge volume like the one that occurred last October. But as Newton
Zinder, a veteran analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., put it in
a commentary this week, ``light volume is not a positive sign when
the market is in a declining phase.''

   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
scolded the Reagan administration for offering ``pitiful''
solutions for the stock market's problems, and promised to press
ahead with his own bill.
   _The Securities and Exchange Commission declared its
independence from the administration by pushing its own plan for
market reform. A sharply divided commission voted 3-2 to ask
Congress for jurisdiction over the stock index futures markets in
Chicago, an area now regulated by a sister agency.
   _An order from United Airlines for 30 757 jetliners capped two
weeks of multibillion-dollar orders for Boeing Co. aircraft. Other
orders included 50 planes for American Airlines and 100 for
International Lease Finance Corp. The orders, which contain options
for even more jets to be purchased in the future, have added to a
boom in work at Boeing, where workers are already complaining about
excessive overtime.
   _Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn announced a $60-per-share
offer for Texaco Inc. after the oil company's management broke off
talks with him on the future of the company. Some analysts doubted
the seriousness of the bid, and Texaco's board flatly rejected it.
   _KaiserTech Ltd., the world's fifth-largest aluminum producer,
said it had agreed to be acquired by Maxxam Group Inc. in a deal
estimated at $725 million.
   _West Point-Pepperell Inc., the nation's largest publicly owned
textile company, said Chicago conglomerate Farley Inc. may try to
purchase as much as 25 percent of its common stock.
   _The Federal Reserve Board gave Bank of New York Corp. another
45 more days to complete its hostile tender offer of Irving Bank Co.
   _A federal appeals court upheld a ruling temporarily forbidding
Hallmark Cards Inc. from making greeting card designs resembling
those of a small competitor, Blue Mountain Arts, clearing the way
for a full trial of the company's $50 million damage suit.
   _Houston's Tenneco Inc., the 10th-largest U.S. oil company,
announced plans to get out of the oil business by selling its oil
and natural gas operations and concentrating on other industrial
and pipeline ventures.
   _The government said the nation's trade deficit narrowed
dramatically during the first three months of the year as an
all-time high in U.S. export sales offset a climb in imports. Other
reports showed orders for durable goods increased in April for the
third consecutive month, tax filings took a chunk out of personal
income and the gross national product advanced more strongly in the
first quarter than previously estimated.
   _A business information group said builders started 16 percent
fewer new housing units in the first quarter than in the same
period of 1987, but a real estate trade association said sales of
existing homes jumped in April while prices in the Northeast moved
up over the first quarter.
   _Dun & Bradstreet Corp. said business failures declined by 10.1
percent in the first quarter over a year earlier as more farmers
and retailers climbed out of the red.
   _Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks in mid-May
rose 2.6 percent from a year ago despite trimming of buyer
incentive lures.
   _President Reagan vetoed a major trade bill for the second time
in three years. The House countered by voting to enact the measure
over his objections, but the Senate is unlikely to go along when it
considers the override after the Memorial Day recess.
   _Reagan said he would nominate John P. LaWare, a Boston banking
executive, to be a member of the Federal Reserve's board of
governors.
   _The Supreme Court let stand a ruling that put millions of
so-called fixed annuities under the jurisdiction of federal
securities laws. In other business-related actions, the high court
agreed to study the power of states to regulate natural gas
production and refused to unravel a merger between units of Eastman
Kodak Co. and Fuqua Industries Inc.
   _New York state officials announced that the Shoreham nuclear
power plant, long a burden to Long Island Lighting Co., would be
torn down. If the plan goes through, it would be the first time a
completed nuclear power plant was abandoned before it opened.

<HEAD>Bond Traders Discover World Wasn't Flat Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond traders discovered the world wasn't flat
last year.
   Among the 13 major international credit markets, public debt
climbed to $9.40 trillion in 1987 from $7.53 trillion in the
previous year, according to a report released this past week by
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   That was an 11.3 percent gain as measured by constant exchange
rates. But in U.S. dollar terms the increase was 25 percent,
reflecting the dollar's depreciation, the report said.
   The need for credit throughout the world has grown by leaps and
bounds in recent years as corporations expand, economies change and
trading becomes more globalized.
   Eight years ago, the world bond market, which includes
government, corporate and municipal issues, totaled about $2.83
trillion, about a fifth of last year's figure, according to Salomon.
   The Salomon report, its seventh annual, had few major changes
from the previous year, except that the market share of U.S.
dollar-denominated bonds issued in 1987 continued to fall while the
Japanese market gained a bit more ground.
   Also, primary market activity in the foreign and Eurobond
sectors slowed in 1987. ``Most of the drop can be attributed to a
steep falloff in U.S dollar-denominated issuance, reflecting
diminished demand for U.S. denominated assets,'' the report said.
   The drop in market share among U.S. dollar-denominated bonds and
notes, to 44.3 percent from 48.7 percent in 1986, was largely due
to a $70 billion decline in the fiscal 1987 federal deficit, the
report said.
   It said outstanding Treasury issues increased by 12 percent,
compared to a 15 percent rise in 1986. The volume of government
agency debt also climbed at a slower pace, 23 percent, vs. 27
percent in 1986. The gains in municipal and corporate issues,
though, were up from the previous year, according to the report.
   Despite the drop, the U.S. dollar bond market remained by far
the largest major bond market in the world last year, with public
issues totaling $4.165 trillion, compared to $3.66 trillion in 1986.
   The Japanese yen bonds came in a distant second, with public
issues totaling $2.12 trillion for a 22.6 percent market share, and
West German deutschemark was third, with $811.5 billion issues and
an 8.6 percent share, Salomon said.
   The others were: Italian lira, $540.1 billion and 5.7 percent
share; French franc, $336.8 billion and 3.6 percent; British
sterling, $332.7 billion and 3.5 percent; Belgian franc, $196.8
billion and 2.1 percent; Canadian dollar, $192.9 billion and 2.1
percent; Swiss franc, $171.7 billion and 1.8 percent; Danish krone,
$171.2 billion and 1.8 percent; Swedish krona, $160.6 billion and
1.7 percent; Dutch guilder, $128.4 billion and 1.4 percent; and
Australian dollar, $73.6 billion and 0.8 percent, Salomon said.
   Although many more countries issue bonds, Salomon doesn't
include them in its count because their markets are less developed
or less liquid.

   In the view of a good many Wall Street analysts,
rising interest rates and the depressed state of the securities
markets are beginning to loom as a factor in this year's election
campaign.
   Pocketbook issues nearly always carry a lot of weight at the
polls. On the surface at least, the picture looks pretty good for
incumbents of both parties right now.
   After all, the unemployment rate is at a 14-year low. Economic
growth has been faster of late than almost anybody expected.
   The recession that was so widely feared in the aftermath of the
stock market crash last year has so far failed to materialize.
   But interest rates have been moving up steadily in recent weeks.
The Federal Reserve, most analysts agree, has been taking measured
steps to tighten credit in order to ward off a revival of inflation.
   And some observers say the Fed faces an especially delicate
mission over the next few months.
   ``In our opinion, in order to deal with the present inflationary
threat, the Fed must tighten more forcefully than it has to date,''
said Paul Getman in a commentary for the Wefa Group, a forecasting
firm. ``Without such a move, bond prices will continue to
deteriorate.
   Getman said the Fed is likely to pull in the reins a bit more in
June, and to raise its discount rate, which now stands at 6
percent, during the summer.
   ``If this tightening is sharp enough,'' he added, ``then the Fed
may not need to tighten again before the election.
   ``But if the Fed is not decisive enough in its actions, then the
bond markets will once again force the Fed's hand, and it will not
be pretty.''
   At the same time, analysts say, Fed policymakers are well aware
of the risks of being too aggressive. The last half-point increase
in the discount rate, on Sept. 4 of last year, may have played a
part in (or at least failed to prevent) a crash in stock prices.
   Amid all these concerns, stocks struggled to break a three-week
losing streak in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 3.85 to 1,956.44.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained .36 to
143.66; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added .63 to 366.66, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index dropped 1.34 to 290.50.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 135.75 million shares a day,
against 156.80 million the week before.
   Optimists on the market outlook argue that the Fed's challenge
will diminish as it becomes apparent that inflation worries are
excessive.
   ``Over the last three years, fears about impending acceleration
of consumer prices have repeatedly swept through the bond market,''
observed economists at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``Yet there is
little evidence of any material acceleration of gains in consumer
prices.
   ``In the past few months, the fear of depression has incredibly
transformed itself into the fear of an economic boom,'' said
Shearson's Michael Sherman. ``Neither expectation was or is based
in reality.''
   In any case, the Fed's success or failure in steering the
economy through the election on solid ground may be determined in
large measure by events beyond its control.
   As Eldon Grimm, an analyst at Birr, Wilson & Co., pointed out,
``Soybean prices have soared to four-year highs due to tight
supplies and threats of drought in some agricultural areas.
   ``The Federal Reserve is powerless to make it rain in the
soybean belt.''

   Trading in the oil futures market has slowed to
a crawl in advance of the next OPEC meeting.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, contracts for July
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
fell 11 cents to $17.43 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Among refined products, the near-term contract for wholesale
unleaded gasoline advanced, rising 0.20 cent to settle at 52.55
cents a gallon. But wholesale heating oil for June delivery closed
at 47.78 cents a gallon, down 0.41 cent.
   ``The market is getting flat,'' said Richard Redoglio of Merrill
Lynch Energy Futures. ``People are finding no reason to take a
position.''
   The analysts said traders appeared reluctant to establish
positions in advance of the next meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, scheduled for June 8 in Vienna,
Austria. The OPEC ministers are expected to resume their ongoing
debate over production and pricing at the meeting.
   ``The market is taking a deep breath before it starts to trade
headlines next week in pre-OPEC posturing,'' said Richard Donovan,
head of the international energy group at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   But Donovan said he expected the $17 mark to provide a temporary
floor for the near-term crude contract.
   ``I'd be surprised if a trapdoor opened on the downside (before
the OPEC meeting),'' Donovan said.
   Analysts attributed the uptick in the June contract for unleaded
gasoline to technical factors as traders squared positions in
advance of the expiration of the contract next Tuesday.

<HEAD>Disposable Income Down, Stock and Bond Markets Mixed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: for Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A steep drop in Americans' April disposable income and a
slowdown in consumer spending have not eased investor fears of
higher inflation or dissuaded economists from forecasting higher
growth this year.
   Disposable personal incomes fell 0.9 percent last month, the
largest drop in a year and the first decline in that category since
last November, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
   Economists attributed the decline to higher tax bills, which
also compelled many consumers to resist big purchases last month.
That left spending basically unchanged in April after a 0.8 percent
rise in March.
   Before adjusting for taxes, personal incomes edged up a tiny 0.1
percent in April after a giant 1.1 percent rise in March.
   The weak income growth and stagnant spending figures ordinarily
would be regarded as signs of a slowing economy. But economists
said the April tax payments, along with an early Easter, helped
depress consumer spending, one of the key engines of economic
growth.
   The report was largely ignored by the financial markets, which
have been preoccupied with anxiety over higher inflation and rising
interest rates spawned by other signs of rapid economic growth.
   There is a spreading belief that the Federal Reserve is
tightening credit to slow the economy down.
   Stocks fell on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials dropped 10.31 points to 1,956.44, finishing the week
with a net gain of 3.85 points. Volume was light.
   In the bond market, a key barometer of interest-rate trends,
prices ended largely mixed after falling earlier in the day. Many
traders quit early for the long Memorial Day weekend.
   Economists who had worried that the October stock crash foretold
a recession have since expressed surprise at the country's surging
economic growth, as signaled by low unemployment, surging exports
and strains on productive capacities.
   The latest survey of the National Association of Business
Economists released Friday showed a substantial upward revision in
growth estimates for this year compared with a survey done three
months ago.
   The economists, who advise some of the country's largest
corporations, said they were looking for the gross national product
to expand 2.9 percent this year, which would match the performance
turned in during 1986 and 1987.
   On Thursday, the government to revise its own estimate of
overall economic growth to 3.9 percent for the first three months
of the year instead of 2.3 percent.

   Texaco Inc.'s directors repudiated a $60-a-share
takeover offer from investor Carl C. Icahn, who responded by
extending the deadline for acceptance and promising a full
explanation of how he would finance the deal.
   Icahn, Texaco's biggest shareholder with a 14.8 percent chunk,
also pressed ahead with a proxy fight for five seats on the oil
giant's board.
   The developments on Friday escalated a fight between the
takeover strategist and the nation's No. 3 oil company, which has
been struggling to return to normal since emerging from bankruptcy
a month ago.
   In a brief statement a few hours before his 5 p.m. EDT reply
deadline, the Texaco directors as expected said no to Icahn's
offer, which values the company at $14.6 billion. They called it a
``non-offer'' pressure tactic and questioned whether he could
arrange the financing.
   Icahn reacted by extended the offer until the company's annual
meeting June 17. He said he would add a 60-day extension after the
meeting if his slate of board nominees wins.
   ``It is a sad day when a board says it's `too late' to give the
owners of a company a chance to vote on a premium proposal to all
stockholders,'' he said in a statement.
   The investor has been pressuring Texaco's management in recent
months to boost the value of the company's stock, if necessary by
breaking it up and selling off the pieces.
   Icahn spokesman Neil Call said there were no plans to sweeten
the offer, and ``that leaves us with no alternative but to go
forward with the proxy contest.''
   In a further effort to bolster his credibility, Icahn said
details of how he planned to finance the offer would be presented
at a security analysts meeting Thursday in New York.
   Even before the board spurned him, Icahn was stoking the fires
of his fight with the company. Late Thursday he mailed ballots to
shareholders urging them to elect his slate of candidates at
Texaco's annual meeting.
   Texaco and Icahn also expanded their war of words to full-page
ads in selected newspapers Friday, with Texaco asking shareholders
if they could trust the company's future to Icahn, and the takeover
strategist urging them to take up his offer.
   Icahn's side of the battle is expected to be an uphill one.
   Analysts have speculated that his offer was intended to flush
out other bidders for Texaco. The consensus on Wall Street is that
he is looking to boost Texaco's stock price rather than end up
running a huge energy concern.
   Investors remained unenthusiastic about the offer Friday. Texaco
stock closed down 37.5 cents a share to $49.62{ in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Although his $60 offer values Texaco's 243 million common shares
at $14.6 billion, Icahn would not have to pay out that much if he
decided to pursue such a bid.
   He would have to pay $12.4 billion for the 207 million shares he
does not already own, and he paid about $1.2 billion for his
existing stake of 36 million shares.
   The combined total of $13.64 billion would amount to the biggest
sum ever paid in a corporate buyout. The previous record was a
$13.4 billion acquisition of Gulf Corp. by Standard Oil Co. of
California, now Chevron Corp., in 1984.
