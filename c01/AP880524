   A jet making an approach in nasty weather
Tuesday lost power in both engines and made an emergency landing
near an abandoned World War II airstrip about five miles short of
the nearest airport, authorities said.
   The TACA International Airlines plane was on its way from San
Salvador and had made a stop at Belize. All 36 passengers and nine
crew members scrambled unharmed from the plane to a nearby levee as
a driving rainstorm started.
   A TACA official, Peter Messina, said the the cause of the engine
trouble was unknown and that the apparently undamaged aircraft was
only three weeks old.
   It landed on a narrow strip of grass, its wings barely fitting
between a drainage canal on one side and a levee on the other.
Witnesses said the plane was close to but not on the actual landing
strip.
   Crew members brushed past reporters without talking. Passengers
were given little opportunity to talk as they were escorted away by
police and Customs officials, but when they did speak they heaped
praise on the jet's pilot, identified by Messina as Carlos Dardano
of El Salvador, about 35 years old, a veteran of about 5 years with
TACA.
   ``It was a very smooth landing,'' said passenger July Mora, a
travel agent from New Orleans. ``I thought we were at the airport.
I was surprised to learn we had landed on a levee.''
   ``As the pilot said, `By the grace of God, I got this sucker on
the ground,''' said the Rev. Leo Humphrey, 52, a Baptist missionary
returning to New Orleans from a ministry in El Salvador.
   Although the landing was smooth, the preceding moments were
frightening, passengers said.
   ``We went through rain and severe turbulence and I thought I
heard them say lightning hit the plane,'' said Mora, although
officials later could not confirm that lightning hit the aircraft.
   ``I've never been on a plane that was so violent. I'm sure the
people were pretty bruised from their seatbelts,'' said Humphrey.
``The plane was going up and down, sideways, and twisting.
Lightning was everywhere. The lights went out on the plane and the
engine died. Everyone thought it was over.''
   The pilot radioed shortly after noon that he lost power in both
engines of the Boeing 737, said Paul Bourg, an area supervisor at
the control tower at New Orleans International Airport.
   ``Control was in the process of trying to direct him to
Lakefront Airport, which is our civil aviation airport, a little
small, but a 737 could use it,'' Bourg said.
   ``About five miles from that airport, the pilot informed
controller that he couldn't make it. That he was going in. The
pilot spotted this unused airstrip.''
   The grass-covered strip is between a National Aeronautics and
Space Administration complex and the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet,
a straight-line shortcut paralleling the Mississippi River from the
Gulf of Mexico to the Port of New Orleans.
   A thunderstorm warning from the National Weather Service was in
effect at the time and there were high winds and lightning in the
area.
   Bourg could not say if weather was a factor in the plane's
trouble.
   The plane landed behind the U.S. Department of Agriculture
offices at the NASA complex.
   Kathy Fernandez, a USDA employee, said she had stepped outside
and saw the plane come down about 400 yards away.
   ``It was a clean landing,'' she said. ``It came down nice. Just
fine. As soon as it landed, the door opened, the chute came down
and the people came out and ran away from the plane.''
   ``As soon as they got out, they just ran up the levee in the
back. It started raining about five minutes after that. It really
started to pour.''
   She and Bob Ural, another USDA employee, said they heard no
engines as the plane came down. Ural said the plane descended as
silently as a glider.
   Passengers and crew were sequestered in an area of the NASA
complex for more than three hours, then taken quickly in a group to
a waiting chartered bus and on to New Orleans International about
24 miles away.
   TACA has been based in San Salvador, El Salvador, for over 50
years but is U.S.-owned and has its main office in New Orleans. An
officials at the main office said the airline did not have any more
information on the reason for the landing.
   Tom Branigan, a spokesman for Martin-Marietta Corp., the main
contractor at the space facility, said there is an overgrown paved
strip at the facility, but that the plane came down on the grass.
   He said it did not appear that the landing gear collapsed and
that from a quarter-mile no damage to the plane was visible.
   He said two passengers with pre-existing medical problems _ one
recent surgery and one high blood pressure _ were taken to the
medical facility on the premises for observation.
   Customs officials were called, he said.
   Employees at Martin Marietta helped the passengers get to nearby
buildings. Branigan said.

   Decatur is competing against Decatur and
another Decatur and yet another Decatur.
   And there are eight more Decaturs in the contest for good
measure.
   Cities and counties named Decatur in 12 states are participating
in a Cans Across the County food collection drive to help the needy
in their areas.
   The food will be distributed in the Decaturs in Alabama,
Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan,
Mississippi, Nebraska, Tennessee and Texas.
   ``We received our challenge from the mayor of Decatur,
Illinois,'' said Dot Montgomery, contest coordinator here. ``They
are challenging all the other Decaturs of America to see who can
raise the most cans of food based on percentage of population.''
   She said the Alabama community is to collect one can of food for
each of its 42,002 residents.
   The Decaturs are divided into three categories according to
population, with Decatur, Ill., the largest at 94,081 residents and
Decatur, Neb., the smallest at 723. A winner will be announced in
each category after the contest ends Aug. 3.
   In addition to helping feed the hungry, the contest's purpose is
to build community cohesiveness and civic pride, said Ann Lewellen,
public relations director of Decatur Advantage in Decatur, Ill.
   ``We wanted to call attention to the fact that unfortunately,
hunger does exist in America, and that we have to take a certain
amount of personal responsibility to do something about it,'' Ms.
Lewellen said.
   ``The local goal is to stock food banks and agencies who serve
the needy,'' she said.
   Ms. Lewellen said her community is beginning its campaign Friday
with a performance of the musical ``Can Can.'' Admission will
require a can of food in addition to a ticket.
   ``I thought it would be fun if we could do some type of sister
city project with the other Decaturs,'' Ms. Lewellen said. ``This
is a project which we can have a lot of fun with and at the same
time, do some good for our community.'

   They came to Appalachia in the late
1960s and early 1970s as eager, young college students determined
to wipe out something most of them had never experienced firsthand:
rural poverty.
   As they prepare for a reunion on Memorial Day weekend, former
members of Volunteers in Service to America, Appalachian Volunteers
and other federal volunteer programs say their work showed the
power of community action but often put them at odds with local
officials.
   If they made some difference in the lives of poor people in West
Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia, the volunteers also
agree their own lives were changed.
   Then-volunteer, now-U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller called his VISTA
work in the tiny community of Emmons a turning point in his life.
   ``After two years, I got hooked,'' said Rockefeller, who later
gave up his plans for a foreign service career to serve in West
Virginia's Legislature and as secretary of state and governor
before winning election to the Senate in 1984.
   Linda Cooper Elkinton, who served in Kentucky, said the
experience of recruiting ``500 eager agents of social change''
started her on a life of community organizing.
   ``I was not a politically aware person at 18,'' said Elkinton,
who now works for a social service agency in Huntington. ``But I
certainly was three years later after volunteering.''
   The volunteers' first hurdle was gaining acceptance.
   ``The poor people up the hollows accepted them pretty well,
particularly once they got to know them a little bit,'' said Jeff
Monroe, who headed West Virginia's Office of Economic Opportunity
from 1964 through 1968.
   But Monroe said the next step, acceptance by local officials,
often failed.
   As long as anti-poverty workers helped repaint schools, organize
recreation programs and teach nutrition classes, there was little
trouble with local power brokers. But the volunteers' activism
didn't stop there.
   To young, idealistic college students who had taken seriously
President Johnson's challenge to ``replace ... despair with
opportunity,'' it soon became apparent that local politicians were
often part of the problem.
   ``When you start fixing up a one-room school, you start
wondering, `Why didn't the local school board fix this up a long
time ago?' Then you ask, `Why aren't there books?' One step at a
time, you start seeing a pattern,'' said Gibbs Kinderman, a former
volunteer who recently completed a series of radio shows about
Appalachian volunteers for the West Virginia Humanities Foundation.
   Volunteers realized Appalachian residents had little power to
influence their own affairs because of unresponsive and often
corrupt bureaucrats who controlled county jobs and welfare benefits.
   ``Organizing power groups is a scary thing for any structure
that's taking advantage of people,'' Monroe said. ``They (local
officials) were very threatened.''
   Many impoverished Appalachian residents knew well what they were
up against and ``were mad about it _ strip mining, the roads, the
schools, lack of jobs, the courthouse gang,'' said Ronnie Sue
Jaffe, now a hospital worker in New York City and an organizer of
the May 29 reunion in Twin Falls State Park.
   Kinderman described county governments in the coal-mining
regions of Appalachia as ``set up to do things the way the coal
companies wanted it.''
   Huey Perry, whose novel ``They'll Cut Off Your Project''
describes anti-poverty, anti-corruption efforts in Mingo County,
said the ``whole system was as corrupt as it could be.''
   Elections, he said, were ``more like sporting contests. And
after the election, the losing party would just say, `They were
able to buy more votes than we were.'''
   Perry said it would be hard to beat the voter turnout in Mingo
County, where the 1960 federal census showed 19,879 voting-age
residents but county records listed 30,331 registered voters.
   A Fair Elections Committee, supported by anti-poverty volunteers
but run by local residents, purged the voter registration books of
5,000 people who were dead or who had moved away.
   Still, the volunteers differ over whether their reform efforts
had much longterm success.
   In Mingo County recently, more than 50 present and former public
officials, among them the head of the anti-poverty program, were
indicted on charges of conspiracy to subvert the free election
system.
   But, said Monroe, ``That they've been indicted at all shows a
change. There was a time when people did a lot and never got
indicted for it.
   ``There was a time when getting a teaching job, getting on
welfare and staying on it, even getting a job on the state highways
(department) were all controlled,'' he said. ``I'd venture to say
that doesn't exist. At least, it's much improved. Of course, there
are those who think I'm naive to say that.
   ``You could say we didn't make any significant changes,'' he
added, ``but I think we did.''
   The percentage of Appalachian households below the federally
defined poverty level has dropped from 31.2 percent in 1960 to 14
percent in 1980, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission
in Washington, D.C.
   The high school dropout rate among the region's 18- to
24-year-olds has declined in the same period from 31.5 percent to
25.3 percent, the commission said.
   But the average annual jobless rate in the region increased from
5.4 percent in 1970 to 7.4 percent last year, according to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   ``There are still terrible pockets (of unemployment) in West
Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky,'' said commission statistician
Judith Maher.
   Would a new War on Poverty work today?
   VISTA has shrunk from a peak of 4,580 full-time volunteers in
1975 to 2,740 today.
   Anti-poverty programs declined mainly because of resistance from
local politicians and the government's growing preoccupation with
the Vietnam War, Perry and other observers said.
   But Milton Ogle, who recruited volunteers in Kentucky and now
works at the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund in Charleston,
said more young people would volunteer today if national leaders
again stressed social issues.
   ``I'm not being political,'' he said. ``The fact is, there has
been a major reduction in these programs.''
   How is the '60s and '70s volunteer effort recalled by those
meant to be its beneficiaries?
   ``At least it provided some hope,'' said Herb Meade of Kermit.
``People slowly but surely realized that some changes could be
brought about. And it did away with the fear, the intimidation,
that we had among the people. You don't find that much anymore.''
   Mae Shrewsbury of Shady Spring agreed the VISTA workers helped.
``They gave us more courage than anything else,'' she said.

   If it bombed in Pretoria, will it play in
Peoria? Paul Slabolepszy hopes so.
   At one theater in South Africa, the entire audience walked out
on Slabolepszy's new anti-apartheid film, ``Saturday Night at the
Palace.'' Now he's looking for a more sympathetic crowd in the
United States.
   ``People couldn't take it,'' Slabolepszy said of the movie's
South African run. ``It's kind of like showing a movie of someone
dying of lung cancer to an audience who are all heavy smokers. It's
so real and so close.''
   The movie is based on a real event _ a rampage by two white men
at a black-run roadhouse on the outskirts of Johannesburg. It was
made into a play that ran in South Africa and Europe.
   Slabolepszy, 40, who wrote the successful play on which the film
is based, plays Vince, a white racist who winds up at a diner late
one night with his nerd of a roommate, Forsie. The black manager of
the roadhouse, played by Tony Award-winning actor John Kani, is
just closing up for the night.
   Forsie wants only to use the telephone, but Vince demands that
the manager, whose name is September, reopen for business. In a
scene that encompasses the last half of the movie, an increasingly
ugly confrontation pits the characters, in shifting allegiances,
against one another.
   The movie, produced and directed by South African Robert Davies,
is a catharsis of sorts for Slabolepszy, who based Vince's
character _ loud, abusive, violent _ on some of the people with
whom he grew up in a small South African town. The son of Polish
immigrants, he moved to South Africa when he was 3 years old.
   ``I grew up in a kind of white racist area _ the attitudes were
very deep,'' he said in a recent interview. ``And when I went to
college (University of Cape Town) ... I was studying alongside
blacks and meeting them socially, and it was a stunning
transformation. Because all of the prejudices I'd grown up with
suddenly melted away, and I realized I'd been living in the middle
of this kind of lie.
   ``I can't watch the movie,'' he said. ``I just slide down in my
seat and I'm praying for someone to get rid of this guy (Vince).
It's just too much _ it assaults and assaults and assaults. But in
a way it's a story that has to be told.''
   At one point in the film, Vince, the unemployed roustabout,
delivers a monologue that frames the movie's political message.
   Enraged at the stubborn gentility of September, he roars,
``Who's he to be in charge of a roadhouse when I'm out of work?
Everywhere you go, all you see is black faces. Bus drivers, bank
tellers _ bloody three-piece suits, man!''
   Apartheid, says Slabolepszy, ``comes from the soul of that kind
of character. It comes from fear _ it's a fear of being swamped.''
   ``This character, Vince, has, I think, the central line of the
(film) when he says, `My old man said if you let a black man get
the better of you, that's the end, you're finished; there's no
going back.' That's his belief.''
   This is a heady time for Slabolepszy and others in South
Africa's artistic community. A series of hit plays have emerged
from Johannesburg _ ``Master Harold ... and the Boys,''
``Sarafina,'' ``Woza Albert,'' among others. South African music
has become an international rage and there is an emergence of black
South African art and literature.
   ``History is happening,'' said Slabolepszy, who yearns to
someday ``make a picture of hope.'' Perhaps, he muses, there will
be a ``happy accident'' in South Africa. In the meantime, he finds
his drama in turmoil.

<DATELINE>ODESSA, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The seedy digs of old Moldovanka, home
for most of the century to crime bosses and legendary tales of
banditry, have been razed and replaced by mournful rows of standard
gray Soviet apartments.
   Italian Street, where Genoa merchants built grand homes in the
last century, is now named for Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The
crumbling mansions house state museums and foreign tourists.
   Languid clerks dole out sugary fruit juice in the bars along the
Black Sea waterfront, where sailors and stevedores drank and
brawled for 150 years.
   The body of old Odessa is decaying and neglected, but looks are
deceiving. The soul of the Ukrainian city known as the ``Mama'' of
dealers, drifters and orphans in the 1920s still spills vice from
darkened recesses into the open marketplace.
   ``You can get anything at the weekend markets _ foreign
currency, liquor, drugs, even prostitutes,'' said Yuri, a
32-year-old black marketeer who keeps his thumbnails long to aid in
dispensing cocaine.
   Teen-agers in jean jackets and designer sweat shirts bought on
the black market flood a slot-machine parlor at the boat terminal.
Heavily rouged prostitutes in leather skirts approach foreign
sailors and well-heeled locals entering the International Merchant
Marine club on Rosa Luxemburg Street. Shell-game swindlers
clustered around the ``Privoz,'' the central market grounds, draw
circles of suckers, supporters and ringers.
   Three young men encountered during a stroll under the chestnut
trees of Deribasovskaya Street say their city is safer now in the
past, when their mothers and grandmothers were afraid to walk alone
after dark.
   ``But everything is still for sale here,'' observed one of the
sportily dressed students. ``Odessans are just natural
businessmen.''
   Housewives out for their daily shopping brazenly approach
foreign tourists to inquire whether they have jeans, cosmetics or
anything else to sell.
   The state-run press says Odessa is the door through which most
contraband enters the Soviet Union, and city officials reluctantly
concede it is true.
   Deputy Mayor Galina Izuvita blames lax security in checking the
cargo of incoming ships. ``In this respect we are envious of cities
that do not have ports through which drugs can enter,'' Ms. Izuvita
said.
   Port manager Nikolai Pavliuk, who has worked in the harbor for
28 years, counters: ``Never has anyone been found to have taken
part in illegal transit of contraband.''
   But to Sasha, a 30-year-old construction worker and drug dealer,
``Odessa is still Mama.''
   At a darkened cafe, Sasha surreptitiously gulped cognac from a
coffee cup and fanned a wad of several thousand rubles to show that
the benefits of trading currencies and narcotics far exceed the 230
rubles ($387) a month he earns from his legitimate job.
   Organized crime networks fed by smuggled goods flourished in
``Mama'' Odessa in the chaos that followed the destruction of the
port during Russia's civil war.
   Writer Isaac Babel had but to change a few names to pass city
life for fiction. Mobster Benny Krik, the likeable hero of ``The
Odessa Tales,'' was modeled after Odessa's Mishka the Japanese.
   But Stalin's terror suppressed the mobs, and 70 years of
socialism have rebuilt the port, housed the orphans and, more
recently, shut down the obvious dens of iniquity.
   Official efforts to tame Odessa's anything-goes spirit have
pasted a veneer of respectability over the city. Youth clubs and
dance halls now occupy vacated bars and liquor shops.
   The authorities launch periodic anti-corruption drives, but a
steady influx of contraband has kept the black markets alive, and
cleanup campaigns are usually short-lived.
   Gypsy fortunetellers cast a wary eye around each club or cafe
before whispering to a patron at the low wooden tables that the
secrets of the future can be had for two rubles ($3.40).
   Many of the city's elegant old buildings were closed or
demolished during a building and refurbishing binge, but a glimpse
of Odessa's lost grandeur is still visible above the colorless
facades and cloudy store windows on Deribasovskaya Street.
   Three or four stories above metal store signs with unimaginative
names like ``Shoes,'' ``Women's Clothing'' and ``Sundries,''
rooftops sport disintegrating cupolas and cornices and leaded
windows from which most of the glass has fallen out.
   A renovation plan begun five years ago touched off a campaign to
preserve Odessa's landmarks, and in early April, chief architect
Vasily Mironenko was fired after proposing to cut down the famed
chestnut trees along Primorsky Boulevard, overlooking the port.
   Many Odessans oppose their city's changing appearance.
   A cab driver traveling through the renovated Moldavanka
neighborhood contended there is an official plot in the Soviet
capital to force Odessa into the Moscow mold.
   ``Odessa is not a phenomenon anymore,'' he said. ``It's just a
town.''
   The driver was quoting Odessa writer Mikhail Shvanetsky, who
said the same about the city in the underground literature he
circulated in the 1970s.

   All three sons were on their best
behavior. Homemade berry liqueur had been poured neatly into seven
tiny glasses, and the table was resplendent with carefully crafted
ors d'oeuvres of salted fish, canned meats and pickled vegetables.
   Olga Chuikov _ wife, mother, economist and Communist Party
activist _ beamed with pride over the table spread lavishly for her
family and the three strangers her friend Lena invited for dinner
with only a few hours' warning.
   Smoothing the skirt of her crimson knit dress and nervously
touching the cluster of curls neatly pinned on the crown of her
head, Olga raised her glass.
   ``What should we drink to?'' asked the hostess, searching her
family and guests with expectant brown eyes. ``There's so much we
are hoping for. It's difficult to decide.''
   Her neighbors and co-workers probably would say Olga has
everything. She and Viktor, her husband of 15 years, have a healthy
family, a four-room apartment, a red Neva car and a summer cottage
in the country. They are as successful and thriving in Soviet
society as were Ozzie and Harriet or the Cleavers, the television
families that celebrated American life in the 1960s.
   A Westerner, like the American journalist brought over by Olga's
friend, party secretary Lena Ivankovich, might have guessed that
Olga hoped for material things: a washing machine, stereo or
fashionable pair of shoes.
   But the hostess, a slender and attractive woman in her mid-30s,
raised her glass and wished for her sons to grow up seeing
Americans as friends, not enemies, for the two governments to stop
posturing and get down to the business of disarmament, for a
peaceful and wholesome future for her family.
   So began a long night of storytelling and exploration that would
teach the Chuikovs about American lifestyles and give the American
a glimpse of the concerns and values of a patriotic and
hard-working Siberian family.
   Olga's and Viktor's curiosity spills out in a flood of questions
about everyday life in a land they've always heard about but
probably will never see.
   ``I know our media often give a negative picture of life in
America,'' Olga began, diplomatically. ``How do Americans see us?
Is it true that they think we are an aggressive society?''
   The level in the liqueur bottle dropped as the debate and
laughter escalated, and Viktor produced a bottle of Armenian cognac
to sustain the conviviality into the early hours of morning. The
boys were told to go to bed, but they stalled in the corners and
doorways of the room, fascinated by the exchange of lifestyle
trivia.
   How much does an American journalist earn each month? How much
does it cost for an apartment? Why do Americans say disrespectful
things about their president? Do the homeless and unemployed
literally starve on the street, or are there places where they can
get help?
   The questions themselves tell a lot about Soviet life. Personal
finances are as popular a subject of discussion as the weather, and
Soviets don't hesitate to ask questions about salary, savings or
debt.
   The Chuikovs _ Olga, Viktor, the boys and Olga's father, Vasily
_ are comparatively well off for a Soviet family. Together, they
have an income of more than 800 rubles a month (about $1,350). That
is four times the wage of an average industrial worker, and their
apartment in the center of this Siberian boomtown is spacious by
any Soviet standard.
   Living space is in extremely short supply and is distributed to
families, usually for life, with the right to pass on an apartment
as inheritance. It's not unusual for a family of four to be housed
in a one- or two-room apartment, and many rooms in Soviet
households serve as dining room, living room and bedroom as the day
progresses.
   Soviets pay about 3 percent of their salary for rent, with the
location and size of the living space playing little part in the
pricing system.
   The Chuikovs were surprised to learn Americans usually pay about
one quarter of their monthly income for housing. But they were even
more intrigued that most middle-class working people live in
separate homes, rather than in apartments, and that homes and
apartments sometimes stand empty for months for want of a tenant or
buyer.
   Suburban living perplexed them, since homes on the outskirts of
a city lack prestige in the Soviet Union. Even in the major cities,
the outer areas are seldom connected to municipal water, heating or
sewer systems. Outhouses and treks to community wells are daily
facts of life within five miles of the Moscow city limits.
   Food costs account for a greater share of the Soviet family's
budget than for Americans, the Chuikovs calculated. They were
tickled by the concept of sprawling grocery stores where it takes
an entire aisle to display all the different brands of coffee or
breakfast cereal.
   ``You just can't buy these things here,'' Olga said. ``We built
up our heavy industries after the war, putting out farm equipment
and industrial machines by the ton, but we haven't paid much
attention to the things we need in everyday life.''
   The tugs of career and homemaking are felt by parents in both
nations, the women agreed, with Viktor and his male guests
grudgingly conceding that the lot of the Soviet working mother is a
tough one.
   ``Does your husband cook for himself and shop for food?'' Olga
wanted to know, casting a reproving look at her husband.
   Soviet homes are devoid of the gadgets that get the American
cook through a meal or the weekly laundry. Olga and Lena are well
educated and well read and had heard of microwave ovens, but they
shook their heads in wonder when told refrigerated leftovers could
be reheated in five minutes.
   Free time and priorities for spending it further underscored
differences between the two lifestyles. Soviet women spend an
average of eight hours a day waiting in lines to buy food and
performing the household chores still shunned by most men.
   Tynda, however, is spared much of the queuing that eats up spare
time in other cities. As the remote Siberian base from which the
Baikal-Amur Railroad is pushing east, the town must truck in
virtually everything it needs. There's no need to search each
store. Cabbage or an electric iron is either available or it's not.
   Soviets generally are more culturally inclined than most
Americans, standing in line for hours or cashing in on past favors
to get tickets to the theater or symphony. Every book is a
cherished possession, and television is something they turn to for
news rather than entertainment, perhaps because programming is
repetitive and of low quality.
   ``As a mother I have to say I don't understand how Americans can
condone violence and anti-Sovietism in films that children can
see,'' Olga said. ``How does this constitute freedom of speech?''
   Rambo and Rocky IV drew the traditional denunciations from the
six adult Soviets, although none had seen either of the films.
   The Chuikovs said their 13-year-old twins spend many
after-school hours in sports, but that the shortage of consumer
services that plagues most of the country is especially hard on
Siberians.
   ``There are not enough music teachers, so they can take only the
most talented, and unfortunately none of my children has
distinguished himself,'' Olga lamented. ``But all the same, I'd
like them to be musically literate.''
   School and work loomed only a few hours in the future, so the
small-scale cultural exchange drew to a reluctant close.
   ``We hope we didn't tire you with so many questions,'' Olga
said. ``It's just such a rare treat to see America through an
American's eyes.''

<HEAD>A One-Night Concert Revival Of `Hair' In New York</HEAD>

   Twenty years ago last month, ``Hair'' brought
the Age of Aquarius to Broadway and the American musical theater
was never quite the same.
   The show, with its contemporary sound and free-wheeling, almost
non-existent book, ran for more than 1,700 performances, spawning
countless touring and foreign companies as well as a successful
movie. Now it is back in New York for one night only, this time in
a unique concert version at the United Nations that will be a
benefit for children with AIDS.
   The concert, to be held May 26 at the U.N. General Assembly
Hall, will reunite the musical's creators _ James Rado, Jerome
Ragni and Galt MacDermot _ as well as many performers who appeared
in various companies of ``Hair'' or the film version.
   The ``Hair'' alumni include Melba Moore, Paul Jabara, Heather
MacRae, Treat Williams, Nell Carter, Andre De Shields and Donna
Summer. Among the other performers scheduled to appear are Bea
Arthur, Frank Stallone, Jay Leno, Rex Smith and Chuck Mangione as
well as a large cast of young, unknown singers.
   ``After 20 years, the anniversary came up and we said, `What are
we doing to do with it?''' Ragni said the other day. ``People told
us to do a big reunion of `Hair' kids and make it just a `Hair'
celebration. We didn't want to do that. In a way, `Hair' was always
used as a rallying point.''
   They found a new rallying point in the plight of children with
AIDS and the money raised from the concert _ ticket prices are
scaled from $250 to $5,000 _ will go to the United States Committee
for UNICEF and the Creo Society's Fund for Children with AIDS.
   ``Hair'' was the most influential of the rock musicals that hit
Broadway and off-Broadway during the late 1960s and early '70s.
More than any other rock show, it integrated te pop music sound of
the day into the Broadway musical.
   Tim Rice, lyricist for such ``Hair''-inspired musicals as
``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ``Evita,'' calls it ``one of the
best Broadway scores ever written.''
   ``Hair'' was also one of the most popular. It spawned four top
four singles on the American pop record charts. Each was sung by a
different artist. Incredibly, one song got to the No. 1 spot,
``Aquarius,'' by the Fifth Dimension; another to No. 2, ``Hair,''
sung by the Cowsills; a third to No. 3, ``Good Morning,
Starshine,'' by Oliver; and a fourth to No. 4, ``Easy to Be Hard,''
by Three Dog Night.
   The musical first opened in New York off-Broadway in October
1967 at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. The
following April it was remounted, recast and redirected and moved
to Broadway's Biltmore Theater.
   Rado and Ragni were in the cast. Rado played a young man named
Claude who was about to be drafted and spends his remaining free
hours with a tribe of first-spirited individuals on the outskirts
of conventional society.
   When the show is done today _ and it still has revivals around
the country _ it's done as a period piece, Rado says.
   ``There's nothing from that era that really showed what went on
with the hippie movement, what that time was about,'' Ragni said.
``It touched on the anti-war movement, racism, the ecology movement
and a lot of other things. All this was going on at the same time.''
   The title of the concert is ``Hair . . . For The Next
Generation,'' and for the show, the trio has composed 18 new songs
including several with such titles as ``Plant Love,'' ``Ozone'' and
``Sweet American'' that sound like they will fit right into the
show. Twelve of the new numbers will be used in the concert as well
as most of the original songs.
   ``We thought, `What would ``Hair'' be like now?' So we wrote
those kinds of songs,'' said Ragni. ``What's the difference between
now and then?''
   The children of today are ready to embrace this show again, its
creators say, and the concert may be the first step toward a new
edition of the show that may play the West Coast and work its way
east.
   ``There is such a revival of the '60s going on right now,''
Ragni said. ```What was that era about?, a lot of them are asking.''
   ``These kids are wondering what their parents were like or what
the kids in those days were like,'' said Rado. ``This show still
gives them a good idea.''

<HEAD>Opposition Candidate Says His Party Is Mexico's `Only Option'</HEAD>

   ``What is lacking is democracy, where
the people no longer are tricked, where there are no monopolies of
any kind, particularly when the monopoly opens the door to
electoral fraud,'' presidential candidate Manuel J. Clouthier was
saying.
   ``We are fighting all of this and we are going to win.''
   ``We'' is the National Action Party, which has put up the
staunchest opposition to Mexico's long-dominant Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has won every election since its
inception in 1929.
   But National Action, known as PAN, has been making deeper
inroads against PRI in northern Mexico in recent years and now
believes it has a better chance than ever to come away with an
upset in the presidential election July 6.
   The 53-year-old Clouthier, a prosperous agricultural
businessman, made his point about winning in an interview with The
Associated Press while on a campaign swing through the northwestern
border state of Northern Baja California.
   He has visited more than 70 cities and towns across Mexico in
his campaign and has sought to portray himself and PAN as a
free-market alternative to PRI's political and economic
centralization.
   ``We are the only real option for change because we are rabidly
democratic, because we want democracy politically, economically,
culturally,'' Clouthier said. ``We are not in favor of government
control of the economy; we represent a social market economy.''
   National Action is strong in northern Mexico, but it has never
been able to build a national base to challenge the PRI, whose
presidential candidate is Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   ``I see that the people of Mexico are more disposed to change
things,'' Clouthier said of conditions now. ``They have been
repressed but are ready to fight once more for the change that they
yearn for.
   ``Our way is distinct; the state monopoly is not concerned with
initiative because it sacrifices everything for the sake of
control.''
   ``Maquio,'' as Clouthier is popularly known, places
responsibility for Mexico's economic troubles on Salinas de
Gortari, who had served as budget and planning secretary under the
incumbent president, Miguel de la Madrid.
   Clouthier supports private enterprise, more government
austerity, greater foreign investment and allowing peasants to own
the land they now are allowed to use and pass on to their children
but not sell.
   For years National Action was the only significant opposition to
the PRI, but the economic difficulties that have lasted throughout
de la Madrid's administration have allowed Clouthier and four other
minority candidates to take a more vocal and visible role this year.
   PAN, cast as a conservative opposition group, has strong support
from business and the Roman Catholic church hierarchy.
   Clouthier, running on a Program for Economic Construction,
contends that corruption has played an important part in Mexico's
economic crisis.
   ``Regarding the foreign debt, the majority of which the
government contracted on the shoulders of the people, I would first
seize the goods of the public officials who have enriched
themselves,'' he said in the interview.
   Mexico's foreign debt of $105 billion is the second largest in
the developing world after Brazil's.
   Clouthier favors the return of the Mexican banking system to the
private sector.
   ``Since the banks have been `ours,' there has been no credit for
the campesino (peasant),'' he said.
   The government of President Jose Lopez Portillo nationalized the
banks in September 1982, at the outset of the economic crisis
brought on by falling oil prices.
   PAN was the runnerup in the 1982 presidential race, with 15.8
percent of votes against 70.9 percent for de la Madrid.

   Vice President George Bush, who already has
the Republican nomination virtually wrapped up, easily won Idaho's
Republican presidential primary on Tuesday, while Michael Dukakis
cruised to an overwhelming victory in the Democrats' nonbinding
vote.
   With 24 percent of the precincts reporting, Bush had 81 percent
of the vote to 10 percent for Pat Robertson, who is no longer an
active contender. Dukakis was pulling in 77 percent to 14 percent
for Jesse Jackson. Sens. Albert Gore Jr. and Paul Simon, both of
whom have suspended their Democratic presidential campaigns, were
getting 3 percent each.
   Bush was winning 15 of the 18 national convention delegates at
stake in the lackluster primary, with two going to Robertson and
one in the uncommitted column. The Democratic vote was purely a
``beauty contest'' exercise; front-runner Dukakis claimed a
majority of the delegates at caucuses two months ago.
   With no statewide elected offices at stake this year and the
presidential candidates all but formally crowned, there was little
to draw Idaho voters to the polls beyond a handful of heated
legislative and local races. Only about one in three registered
voters were expected to cast ballots.
   ``For various reasons, the presidential election and others,
neither we nor the county clerks are seeing very much intensity in
this one,'' Deputy Secretary of State Ben Ysursa said.
   On the Republican side, Robertson remained on the ballot as a
challenge to the vice president although he suspended his candidacy
earlier this month and returned to his Christian Broadcasting
Network.
   Bush made a 19-hour campaign swing through Idaho earlier this
month to bolster his support in a state that has not given its four
electoral votes to a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.
   On the Democratic side, where no delegates were at stake, the
Massachusetts governor was expected to easily win the nonbinding
preference vote over Jackson.
   Democrats allotted 18 of their 24 nominating delegates in Super
Tuesday caucuses held on March 8. Dukakis captured eight of them,
Jackson four and six were uncommitted.
   Since then, however, Gov. Cecil Andrus, one of the six
previously uncommitted ``super delegates,'' has endorsed Dukakis
and urged others to do the same so the party is clearly unified for
the November assault on the White House.
   Although there has been no statewide polling conducted, a
Democratic poll this spring in the conservative 2nd Congressional
District of southern Idaho showed Dukakis only 2 percentage points
behind Bush.
   ``But it's a long time to the finish line,'' said state Senate
President Pro Tem James Risch of Boise, Bush's state chairman.
``The people will have a choice between a person who knows the
issues and a governor of a state that really hasn't done very
well.''
   Former Gov. John Evans, the state chairman for Dukakis, saw the
poll giving Bush 44 percent and Dukakis 42 percent as an indication
Democrats have a chance in Idaho this year.
   ``People are looking for a new leader,'' Evans said.

   ``Knot's Landing'' star Michele Lee teamed up
with other celebrities and safety representatives to strap what
they called the world's largest seat belt around the landmark
Hollywood sign.
   The 400-by-10-foot strap was fastened with a symbolic click
around the 55-foot high letters Monday to kick off Buckle Up
America! Week. Promoters hope drivers below will get the idea.
   Miss Lee, chairwoman of the Committee for Safety Belt Awareness
for the Entertainment Industries Council, was joined at the
ceremony by National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator Diane
Steed and members of the American Coalition for Traffic Safety.
   ``Buckling up and drunk driving have long been priority issues
for myself and for the Entertainment Industries Council,'' Miss Lee
said. ``We welcome this opportunity to show America that Hollywood
cares about saving lives and that the entertainment community is
committed to these two vital issues.''

   Actress Bette Davis, who left Los Angeles as
filming was beginning on ``Wicked Stepmother,'' is due back on the
set this week, says the movie's producer-director.
   ``Everything's amicable. She's coming back,'' Larry Cohen said.
   Patience is the key to working with Miss Davis, whose
comings-and-goings on the set have created a stir, Cohen said last
week.
   ``She's 80 and you have to be patient with her because you do
get a great performance and it is Bette Davis,'' Cohen said.
   Besides, Cohen said of the stir, ``Any publicity is good
publicity.''
   ``It was basically a health problem. If you're not feeling well
and things are bothering you _ like dental problems _ it's hard to
work. Now that that's been taken care of, she's coming back.''

   As 30,000 screaming fans shook the stadium
foundations and hundreds of riot police officers stood guard,
Michael Jackson opened his European ``Bad Tour'' with a high-tech
show of song, sound, light and magic.
   Amid dancing spotlights and rising smoke, Jackson appeared like
a ghost on the 200-foot-long stage of the Flaminio soccer stadium
for the start of Monday night's two-hour concert.
   Wearing black from head to toe, he launched into ``Wanna Be
Startin' Somethin''' and followed with a string of his hits,
including ``Billie Jean,'' ``Human Nature,'' ``Thriller,''
``Heartbreak Hotel,'' ``Bad,'' ``Can't Stop Loving You'' and ``The
Way You Make Me Feel.''
   The sound of his voice was often nearly drowned out by the
ecstatic crowd.
   The stadium appeared under siege as rifle-toting riot police,
some on horseback, patrolled the grounds to deter gate-crashers and
troublemakers.
   Before the concert, police and security guards had to rescue
dozens of fans from being crushed in the mass of people pushing
toward the stage. Several people fainted.

   Gov. Rose Mofford suffered a mild
concussion in a fall from a rostrum, but told state lawmakers that
she's ``not out for the season.''
   Dr. Timothy Harrington, a neurosurgeon at St. Joseph's Hospital,
diagnosed the mild concussion, Mrs. Mofford's spokeswoman, Vada
Manager, said Monday. Mrs. Mofford also complained of pain in her
right wrist and shoulder, but apparently there are no broken bones,
the spokeswoman said.
   She will work at home this week, Manager said.
   The governor said in a statement: ``Rose Mofford took some
pretty hard spills during her years playing softball and
basketball. Please tell my teammates in the Legislature that I'm
not out for the season.''
   Mrs. Mofford fell 1 to 2 feet from a rostrum during an anti-drug
meeting in Yuma on Sunday night and then gamely went on to joke
about the fall and give her talk.
   Her chair was accidentally knocked off the platform by Gene
Stallings, head coach of the Phoenix Cardinals of the National
Football League, who was returning to his chair after a brief talk.
Stallings also fell, but was uninjured.

   It may not be on any best-seller list,
but a 1979 high school yearbook featuring photographs of senior Don
Mattingly with a nylon stocking on his head is worth as much as
$650, according to a collector.
   You'll strike out, however, if you call the high school hoping
to snag a copy, which features the New York Yankees first baseman.
   ``We get calls all the time, but we're completely out of
yearbooks,'' said Reitz Memorial High School receptionist Pam
Goergen.
   ``That book is probably the most collectible because it has the
most pictures,'' said Steve Moody, 30, a sports memorabilia dealer
in Evansville. ``There's a picture of Don in a skit at school. All
the guys have stockings over the face, which is hilarious.''
   Reitz Memorial's 1979 book was recently advertised for $650 by
an Allentown, Pa., dealer. In the same ad, a 1949 Commerce, Okla.,
yearbook with Mickey Mantle went for $950.
   ``The most paid for them are from the New York area,'' Moody
said. ``Here in Evansville, it's difficult to get $400 for a
Memorial yearbook, but because he's a Yankee and one of the best
players around, boy, you can get a lot on the East Coast.''

   Federal agents arrested five men and seized
at least 30 tons of hashish and 15 tons of marijuana in one of the
biggest drug busts of its kind, authorities announced Tuesday.
   The Asian-grown drugs, with a wholesale value of $162 million,
were hidden in welded compartments of an oceangoing barge that was
seized late Monday as it entered San Francisco Bay. Agents also
seized the tug Intrepid Venture.
   ``This drug cargo was very carefully concealed in the barge by
obviously very experienced smugglers,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Steve Graham, head of the Organied Crime Drug Enforcement
Task Force, a multi-agency organization that investigated the case.
   The five arrested were tug skipper, Calvin Robinson, 47; his son
William, 25, of Vacaville; his nephews Frank Robinson, 25, of
Corning and John Robinson, 23, of Santa Rosa; and his stepson,
Wesley Bastin, 25, of Corning, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric
Swenson.
   The elder Robinson had been acquitted of harboring a fugitive in
the 1980 prison escape of Christopher Boyce, the convicted spy who
was portrayed in the movie ``The Falcon and the Snowman.'' Robinson
was serving time on escape and counterfeiting charges in Lompoc
prison when he met Boyce.
   The Coast Guard's Pacific commander, Vice Admiral John Castello,
said the drug seizure was ``probably the biggest hashish-Thai
marijuana catch in the history of the United States.''
   The five were charged with large-scale drug smuggling and
conspiracy, punishable by at least 10 years in prison without the
possibility of parole and a possible $4 million fine.
   A bail hearing was set for Friday.
   The elder Robinson owned the tug and barge through his Napa
business, Dredge Master Associates, Swenson said.
   Rollin B. Klink, U.S. Customs Service special agent, said a
piece of ``minor'' information led to the seizure, but he refused
to elaborate. He said the organization behind the operation was
``huge'' and had been going on for a long time.
   The 70-foot tug left San Francisco Bay with the barge in tow in
early May, Graham said.Authorities believe the drugs had been
loaded onto the barge from a ``mother ship'' 1,000 miles offshore.
   The whereabouts of the mother ship remain unknown.
   The tug and barge were taken to Yerba Buena Island, where task
force investators began their search.

<HEAD>Grain Sales to Soviets To Reach Three-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's value of U.S. agriculture exports
to the Soviet Union is expected to climb 50 percent to a three-year
high of $1.4 billion, according to Agriculture Department
economists.
   ``Behind the gain will be much larger wheat shipments at higher
prices and much bigger soybean and soybean meal sales,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said Monday.
   Farm product sales to the Soviets exceeded $1.9 billion in 1985
but plummeted to a 13-year-low of $658 million in 1986 before
rebounding to $938 million in calendar 1987.
   A major factor has been large sales of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices under the department's Export Enhancement Program.
   ``The U.S. value share of Soviet grain imports may be above 30
percent for the first time since 1984 and (may comprise) over 8
percent of total agricultural imports,'' the report said.
   Although total Soviet agricultural imports may increase 5
percent in 1988 from last year's estimated $16 billion, the value
will still be below the $19 billion average during the first half
of the 1980s.
   ``Grain imports now cost about $3 billion a year instead of $7
billion as in 1981-85,'' the report said. Despite a possible 20
percent rise in the per-ton cost of imported grain in 1988, this
``unit value'' will still be around one-third lower in the early
1980s.
   Kathryn Zeimetz, chief author of the report, said the forecast
of $1.4 billion this year is still far below the $2.9 billion in
the value of U.S. agricultural sales to the Soviets in 1984. The
standing record is $3 billion in 1979, she said.
   Earlier this month, the USDA forecast 1988 grain output at 215
million metric tons, up 2 percent from last year. It also would be
the third consecutive harvest of more than 200 million tons, a
historic first for the Soviet Union.
   ``Crops are off to a much better start than in 1987 following a
good fall sowing, overwintering and spring planting conditions,''
Monday's analysis said. ``Barring unusually severe weather through
the spring and fall, 1988 crop output should increase.''
   Greater output and improved productivity in agriculture are
prerequisites for improvement in the Soviet economy.
   ``The agro-industrial complex accounts for more than 30 percent
of the gross social product, 70 percent of the retail trade sales
and one-third of the productive capital and work force,'' the
report said.

   A proposed change in Agriculture Department
regulations would hold farmers and others in the marketing chain
financially accountable for livestock carcasses condemned at
slaughter plants because of illegally high traces of drugs.
   B.H. ``Bill'' Jones, administrator of the department's Packers
and Stockyards Administration, said Monday the proposal is intended
to deter the sale of medicated animals for slaughter and shift
economic responsibility for illegal drug residues from the meat
packer to those who cause the violation.
   Under the proposal, a meat packer would be able to ``bill back''
the person from whom the livestock was bought if it is condemned
because of illegal drug residues.
   In order to make the plan work, Jones said, each purchaser or
selling agency in the marketing chain would be permitted to use the
bill-back procedure. If a seller failed to settle up, the buyer or
selling agency would be permitted to deduct from a subsequent
purchase from the same person.
   Jones said that although a small percentage of livestock
producers are selling medicated animals for slaughter, the
illegally high drug residues continue to be a problem, notably in
swine, culled dairy cows and young calves.
   The proposal will be open 60 days for public comment. Those can
be sent to: Packers and Stockyards Administration, Room 3039-S,
USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250.

   An additional 3,375,367 acres of highly
erodible cropland will be taken from production under the
Agriculture Department's 10-year Conservation Reserve Program.
   Milton Hertz, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Program, said Monday the acreage was
accepted from offers, or bids, during the program's sixth signup
held Feb. 1-19. A total of about 4.5 million acres was offered
during the signup.
   In all, counting the earlier signups, more than 25.5 million
acres have been accepted into the program, he said. Another signup
will be held July 18 through Aug. 5.
   Congress in the 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45
million acres for the program by 1990.
   Under the program, farmers agree to take land from production
for 10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, they get annual
rental payments from the government and one-time assistance pay for
half the cost of planting grass, trees and shrubs to guard against
erosion.
   Hertz said the bids accepted from the latest signup averaged
$47.90 per acre annually, compared with $48.45 for the first five
signups.

   President Robert Mugabe's socialist
government lifted a yearold freeze on prices in a bid to boost the
ailing economy.
   The announcement was made in a special edition of the government
gazette.
   The move means that manufacturers, retailers, utilities and
landowners will be able to immediately raise prices, fees and
commercial rents by 5 percent. Private rents remain under state
control.
   The freeze was lifted three months after the government
suspended controls over wage increases, allowing minimum pay checks
to be boosted by 15 percent.
   Curbs on wage and price increases were imposed a year ago to
check inflation, then running at about 20 percent.

   The average number of days patients spent in
hospitals declined between 11 percent and 15 percent in the early
1980s, a researcher for the Department of Health and Human Services
said Tuesday.
   The decline has reduced health care costs for individuals, the
government and insurers but ``in a sense, there's a false sense of
savings'' said Dean Farley, the deputy research manager of the
Hospital Studies Program in the National Center for Health Services
Research and Health Care Technology Assessment.
   ``Hospitals are reducing their costs. Insurers and the
government are saving money, but patients still need nursing care''
and they usually get it from family members, said Farley.
   According to the study, the average hospital stay declined from
7.35 days in 1980 to 5.71 days in 1985, according to The New York
Times, which reported on the study in Wednesday's editions.
   Farley said the decline has occurred despite the fact that
hospitals are tending to admit patients who are sicker and who
therefore stay longer. But for some specific medical conditions,
the length of stay has been shortened, he said.
   For example, women admitted for normal delivery of babies used
to stay in the hospital three to five days. But it's not unusual
now to find women being discharged one or two days following
delivery, he said.
   ``The decline has been very substantial and what has happened is
that people (who once were admitted for) relatively short stays
aren't getting into the hospitals,'' said Farley. Instead, he said,
they are treated on an outpatient basis.
   The study attributed the decline in hospital stays to several
factors, he said. They include changes in reimbursement by
government insurance programs like Medicare, a shift towards
outpatient care, increased use of second opinions and utilization
review, changes in the ways hospitals are competing for patients,
growth in health maintenance organizations and other prepaid
insurances and ``selective contracting'' on the part of insurers
who are shopping around among hospitals on the basis of costs.
   Farley said hospitals reacted to policies put in place by
insurers and public agencies that believed hospital usage was
excessive.
   However, following such policies is now presenting a problem for
hospitals, he said.
   ``It's not unusual to have them operating at 50 to 60 percent on
average,'' Farley said. He said the decline may be contributing to
some hospital closings.
   ``The state of Maryland was actively discussing about a year and
a half to two years ago how to eliminate 20 percent of the hospital
beds in the state,'' he said. ``I think those kinds of discussions
are taking place all over the country. ... The real challenge is
what to do with that excess.''
   Farley said the decline is leveling off.
   ``Lengths of stay have fallen as much as they are going to for
awhile but there are some questions in terms of caseloads and the
kinds of patients that they are going to treat,'' he said.
   The study did not look at how hospitals are coping with the
declining stays of patients, but ``the next question is what they
can afford to do ... whether a decline like this will leave the
hospitals financial capable.''

<HEAD>Court Takes Up Distinction Between Child Pornography, Innocent
Photography</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court says it will tell states
whether they may combat child pornography with laws so restrictive
that parents could be prosecuted for taking pictures of their naked
infants.
   The court agreed Monday to consider reinstating a Massachusetts
law struck down by that state's highest court as too broad a
restriction on free-speech rights.
   A decision is expected from the justices sometime next year.
   The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court threw out the criminal
prosecution in Worcester County of Douglas Oakes, who had been
convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for ``soliciting a
child to pose for pornographic purposes.''
   Prosecutors said Oakes in 1984 induced his 14-year-old
stepdaughter to pose for photographs taken in their home while she
was clothed only in bikini underpants.
   Police were contacted after the girl's mother discovered the
photographs.
   When Oakes appealed, the state's highest court voted 4-3 to
overturn his conviction and dismiss the criminal indictment.
   The state court said photography is a form of expression
entitled to the Constitution's free-speech protections. It said the
state could interfere with such expression only to serve an
important governmental purpose, and that the interference had to be
narrowly drawn to serve that purpose.
   The Massachusetts court noted that the challenged law ``makes a
criminal of a parent who takes a frontal-view picture of his or her
naked 1-year-old running on a beach or romping in a wading pool.''
   The state court's three dissenters, however, said Oakes' taking
photographs of his stepdaughter represented conduct, not a form of
expression.
   They said the ``narrowly drawn'' requirement traditionally
imposed in challenges to laws having an impact on freedom of
expression should not apply.
   In the appeal acted on Monday, Massachusetts Attorney General
James M. Shannon relied heavily on a 1982 Supreme Court decision
that excluded child pornography from free-speech protections.
   He said the 1982 ruling ``established that states are entitled
to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depictions of
children than might be appropriate in other contexts.''
   Shannon called the prosecution of a parent for taking pictures
of very young naked children ``unlikely,'' adding, ``It is
noteworthy in this regard that not a single application of the
statute to this type of situation has ever been presented.''
   The attorney general said Oakes' taking ``sexually suggestive
nude photographs of his 14-year-old stepdaughter in secret ... is
conduct which the commonwealth could properly criminalize.''
   In other matters, the court:
   _Gave trial judges broad power to deny criminal defendants the
lawyer of their choice if a possible conflict of interest exists.
The court, 5-4, upheld the narcotics-trafficking conspiracy
conviction of a California man denied the lawyer of his choice even
though he was willing to waive his right to conflict-free legal
help.
   _Gave states, by a 6-2 vote in an Ohio case, some authority to
enforce safety codes at federal nuclear production facilities for
hazards unrelated to radiation.

   A state Highway Patrol officer responding to
a report of a possible drunk driver shot a motorist to death
Tuesday after the man opened fire with a pistol at point-blank
range, authorities said.
   The motorist stopped by officer Ronald T. Kunkel raised a pistol
and fired without warning as the patrolman reached into the man's
window to switch off the ignition, said patrol spokesman Sgt. Randy
Yaeger of Helena.
   ``(Kunkel) just walked up and `boom,''' Yaeger said.
   Kunkel, wounded in the left shoulder, drew his .38-caliber
revolver and apparently fired six shots as he fell away from the
van, and at least one bullet hit the motorist in the head, Yaeger
said.
   Officers said they found Kunkel's blood-stained hat in the
motorist's lap. The shooting occurred about 3:45 p.m., and Kunkel,
who was alone on patrol, radioed for help after he was wounded,
Yaeger said.
   Kunkel, 37, of Belt, was listed in fair condition at Columbus
Hospital in Great Falls.
   The dead motorist's identity ``isn't available at this time,''
Yaeger said. His van had license plates from Cascade County, the
Great Falls area.
   Yaeger said the man was described as elderly, with white hair
and a beard.
   Kunkel stopped the van for erratic driving just east of Belt on
U.S. 87 near Armington Junction, about 25 miles east of Great
Falls, Yaeger said. Officers on the scene said Kunkel had received
a report of a possible drunk driver.
   Yaeger said the motorist didn't pull to the side of the road,
but stopped in the middle of the westbound lane.

   Classes resumed at Hubbard Woods
Elementary School on Tuesday for the first time since Laurie Dann's
murderous rampage, and authorities stepped up their efforts to
learn how Ms. Dann, despite erratic and often threatening behavior,
was always one step ahead of the law.
   Ms. Dann stormed the school Friday and fired on pupils in a
second-grade classroom, fatally wounding an 8-year-old boy and
injuring five other children. She wounded a seventh person at a
nearby house where she barricaded herself before taking her own
life.
   Sgt. Gene Kalvaitis, spokesman for Winnetka Police Chief Herbert
Timm, said that investigators were dispatched Tuesday to Madison,
Wis., and Tucson, Ariz., to gain more information about Ms. Dann's
``motivation.''
   A task force made up of neighboring police departments and the
Cook County sheriff's police, has begun reviewing Ms. Dann's
repeated run-ins with authorities during the past three years.
   ``It's not an unheard-of situation,'' said Kalvaitis. ``Five or
six of the (police) departments in this area had contact with her
before, but none of them knew that.
   ``And the information that should be centered somewhere _ and
available to every department _ never gets to one location,'' he
added. ``That's one thing we hope bringing our departments together
for this investigative effort is going to solve.''
   In Madison, vials containing mysterious substances, library
catalog cards on books about poisons and a laboratory smock were
found in an apartment Ms. Dann had rented since January, said FBI
agent Kent Miller. Winnekta police were expected to analyze the
vials' contents, he said.
   In Tucson, the investigators were to interview a one-time
boyfriend of Ms. Dann's to whom she had recently made death threats.
   ``The feeling is if we understand her motivation, we might be
able to stop something like this from happening in the future,''
said Kalvaitis.
   Classes were held at the school for the first time Tuesday,
where children returned with ``a business-as-usual attitude,'' said
Principal Richard Streedain.
   Administrators said the children displayed surprising maturity
at meetings over the weekend to discuss the tragedy and during a
memorial service Monday for 8-year-old classmate Nicholas Corwin.
   Six persons wounded in Friday's rampage were still hospitalized
Tuesday, one of them in critical condition.
   By Tuesday, law enforcement agencies had recovered 21 packages
of poisoned food and beverages Ms. Dann apparently delivered to
acquaintances or former employers before Friday's shootings. No one
has been seriously harmed by the tainted food.
   Kalvaitis said authorities also learned Tuesday that Ms. Dann
mailed three additional packages Friday morning, two to Madison,
Wis., which authorities now have, and a third to California.
   ``The only thing I can say right now about the California
package right now is that it's been mailed. I can't say if we know
where and to whom,'' he said.
   Kalvaitis also said authorities were awaiting the results of
toxicology tests to complete the autopsy on Ms. Dann.
   Over the past three years, Ms. Dann was a suspect in the
ice-pick stabbing of her ex-husband, accused of stealing food and
clothing from homes where she worked as a baby sitter, and arrested
for shoplifting in Madison.
   Ms. Dann also was accused of making death threats to a number of
people, most recently to the former college boyfriend who is now a
doctor in Tucson.
   In a May 9 conversation recorded by authorities, Ms. Dann said
she would kill the doctor and his family ``and make it look like
the doctor's wife did it,'' said Pima (Ariz.) County deputy
attorney Lou Spivack.
   Janet Johnson, the federal prosecutor assigned to the case, said
in a telephone interview from Tucson that she planned to seek an
indictment, but delayed doing so because ``we wanted to go forward
in more than one jurisdiction.''
   The doctor ``was worried that if we couldn't arrange to have her
held without bond, that she might get out and fixate on him even
further,'' she said.
   Ms. Johnson's office had arranged for FBI agents May 13 to go
speak to Ms. Dann in Madison, where she had lived since January.
They were unsuccessful in finding her on that date, as well as
during a second visit May 15 _ just five days before she went on
the shooting spree.

   Family and friends Monday buried an
8-year-old boy shot to death during a deranged woman's rampage,
struggling to make sense of a death so tragic that ``we know that
God is weeping,'' a rabbi said.
   On a brooding, gray day that mirrored the community's grief,
more than 1,000 mourners _ dozens of them children in brightly
colored slickers _ crowded a synagogue for a funeral service for
Nicholas Corwin.
   The youngster was fatally wounded Friday when Laurie Dann
stormed the Hubbard Woods Elementary School and fired on a
second-grade classroom. Five students and a man who lived at a
nearby house were wounded during Ms. Dann's spree of violence,
which ended when the 30-year-old woman shot herself to death.
   In a broadcast interview Monday night, her ex-husband Russell
Dann said her rampage might have been prevented.
   ``I hired attorneys. I hired private detectives. ... This was
the North Shore of Chicago reaching out for help, not just Russell
Dann ... I'm not saying we got no help, but Friday happened,'' Dann
said on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   He also said that ``on many occasions, we tried to get her
arrested,'' but police did not pursue her case actively enough.
   ``Nightline'' host Ted Koppel said Dann volunteered to appear on
the program in the hope that he could prevent the repeat of a
tragedy like the school shootings.
   Children, teachers, counselors and other parents gathered at the
school later Monday for a memorial service.
   ``I think the adults will have a harder time letting go than our
kids. They're much more resilient that way,'' said LaDonna Covelle,
whose second-grade son, Mark, and third-grade daughter, Jennifer,
attend the school.
   ``We left the funeral service this morning and ... Mark said, `I
can't wait until it's normal again.'''
   Classes were canceled at the school Monday and a half-dozen
police officers were outside.
   ``We're running a tightrope between an attempt to keep things
normal and secure,'' Superintendent Donald Monroe said. ``We
shouldn't tell schools across America to lock their doors to the
neighborhoods around them,'' Monroe said.
   ``So deep is our sorrow, so great is our loss, that we know that
God is weeping,'' said Rabbi Robert Schreibman during Nicholas'
funeral service at Temple Jeremiah in nearby Northfield.
   ``The death of the young is always tragic, but this was so
sudden, so swift _ it was such an unexpected loss of a wonderful
and promising child with so much to give,'' Schreibman said.
   Nicholas was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in nearby Skokie.
   ``Nicky was extremely well-liked _ loved. He seemed to be the
leader,'' said Amy Moses, 29, the substitute teacher who was in the
classroom when the shooting occurred and tried unsuccesfully to
disarm Ms. Dann.
   She said children asked her who would serve as the rules expert
for playground games with Nicky gone, ``who was going to break the
records, who was going to score the goals?''
   The students and faculty plan to give Nicholas' parents a book
of remembrances about the boy titled, ``Gifts Nick Gave Us,''
Monroe said after the school memorial.
   Three of the five children wounded in Friday's attack were in
fair condition at Evanston Hospital on Monday, while 8-year-old
Lindsay Fisher remained in critical condition, said Dr. John C.
Alexander Jr., chief of heart and chest surgery at the hospital.
   The two other victims were listed in fair condition Monday at
Highland Park Hospital, said hospital spokesman Chuck Block.
   Before the shooting, Ms. Dann delivered tainted treats to two
college fraternities and several homes where she had worked as a
babysitter. Police said no one was seriously injured by the
poisoned fruit juice and cereal treats.
   After the poisonings, discovered Saturday, ``we're just keeping
our fingers crossed that it is over,'' said Winnetka Police Chief
Herbert Timm on CBS ``This Morning.''
   Later Monday, Timm said a task force had been formed by area
police departments in an effort to ``put Laurie Dann and this
situation to rest.'' He said authorities had ``a few other leads to
pursue'' but wouldn't be more specific.''
   Gov. James R. Thompson on Monday called for tightened
handgun-control laws, although he noted the general public ``is
never going to be protected against random, bizarre behavior.''
   On Friday morning, Ms. Dann set a small fire at the house of a
family she babysat for who had told her they were moving away and
gave tainted milk to two of the children.
   The daughter of a wealthy suburban family and a former student
at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Ms. Dann was due to stand
trial in Madison, Wis., on charges of shoplifting several women's
wigs March 14.
   She also was being investigated by federal authorities for
making threatening telephone calls in three states to former
friends and members of her ex-husband's family.

   A fire that burned out of control
for a month on Brazil's largest offshore oil platform destroyed
everything above the waterline at the $330 million facility, the
state oil company Petrobras said.
   ``Only the submersible part can be reused,'' Petrobas spokesman
Palmeira Guimaraes said of the Envhova platform. ``The rest was a
total loss.''
   The fire began at the facility 120 miles east of Rio on April 23
when leaking gas exploded and started to burn.
   No one was injured, but Petrobras shut down production at
Enchova and five nearby fields that together produce 77,000 barrels
of oil and 2 million cubic meters of gas daily _ about 11 percent
of the nation's output.
   On Saturday, Petrobras put out the main blaze at the oil
platform by pumping water into the gas field through an auxiliary
well, Guimaraes said.

   Dean O. Hebert, who remembers being
called an ``oyster'' by high school classmates taunting him for his
love of writing, has been awarded the Sophie Kerr Prize.
   The prize, which this year is worth $27,836, is awarded annually
to a graduating senior from Washington College who displays
``ability and promise for future fulfillment in the field of
literary endeavor.''
   It was established 20 years ago after the death of novelist,
serial writer and Eastern Shore resident Sophie Kerr, who left a
trust fund and stipulated that half the interest be awarded to a
promising young writer.
   Hebert was awarded the prize Sunday after a panel of literature
teachers praised an unpublished novel he began three years ago.
   Hebert's first book is a two-part futuristic novel in which the
main character tries to find order in a turbulent world.
   ``This makes me feel very good,'' the 20-year-old Hebert said.
``It just makes me feel like I'm going to be a writer some day. Or
even maybe today.''

   Nuclear power opponents threw a
fire bomb that destroyed a garage on the site of a proposed nuclear
waste recycling plant, police said. No injuries were reported.
   Police arrested 10 people after the fire bombing on Monday at
the construction site near the Bavarian village of Wackersdorf, 35
miles north of Regensburg. The garage, which housed construction
equipment, was destroyed by the resulting fire, police said.
   Earlier Monday, opponents of the planned nuclear facility
blocked a railroad line near Wackersdorf by placing tires and
pieces of wood on the tracks and setting the materials on fire,
police said.
   Train service on the line was delayed for about 3{ hours, police
said.
   On Sunday, 1,000 people protested the planned facility in a
rally next to the fence surrounding the site. The construction site
has been the scene of violent clashes between protesters and police
in the past.

   Even for veterans of White House bureaucratic
battles, the competition to go to Moscow for next week's historic
U.S.-Soviet summit is intense.
   ``Is there a lot of interest in the trip? The answer is yes,''
said Thomas C. Griscom, the assistant to the president for
communications and planning. Griscom and Colin L. Powell, Reagan's
national security adviser, chair a summit planning group.
   Besides interest, there are hurt feelings from the State
Department in Foggy Bottom to the White House at 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue over who's going to the summit and who's not, officials say.
   ``We really need to restrict the numbers and you have to start
at home so you have to make cuts within your own operation,''
Griscom said. Among the casualties: Karen Fuller, Griscom's
executive assistant.
   Even so, 800 people _ from arms control negotiators to White
House stewards _ will be part of the president's entourage, Griscom
said. That number includes 275 members of the White House press
corps. The four television networks, ABC, CBS, NBC and Cable News
Network, also are expected to each have as many as 150 people
flying in separately to the Soviet Union.
   With the president's eight-year term nearing an end, the May
29-June 2 summit is one of the last _ and possibly the most
spectacular _ overseas extravaganzas to be staged by the Reagan
White House.
   The Moscow leg of the trip, the first visit by a U.S. president
to the Soviet Union in 14 years, is preceded by three days in
Helsinki, Finland, and followed by a stop in London.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, will be joined by key members of the
Cabinet, including Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci. Also joining the traveling party are
White House chief of staff Howard Baker and U.S. Information Agency
Director Charles Z. Wick. Besides Mrs. Reagan, Mrs. Shultz is the
only wife traveling with her husband.
   Rozanne L. Ridgway, the assistant secretary of state for
European and Canadian affairs who has participated in many
negotiations with the Soviets, will play a key role in the summit,
as will members of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   ``It's a wonderful finale,'' said Ambassador Selwa Roosevelt,
the chief of protocol. ``I can't think of a more appropriate way to
come to the concluding months of the president's term.''
   Mrs. Roosevelt's office is helping Linda Faulkner, the White
House social secretary, prepare for the ``enormous project'' in
Moscow, which includes a dinner party the Reagans will host for the
Gorbachevs at Spaso House, the ambassador's residence in Moscow.
American food and California wines will be flown in for the
evening, with entertainment by jazz pianist Dave Brubeck.
   Among the other events: Reagan's visit to historic Danilov
monastery; one meeting with dissidents and another with Soviet
writers and artists; a speech at Moscow University; a state dinner
hosted by the Gorbachevs in the Hall of Facets at the Kremlin; Mrs.
Reagan's trip to Leningrad; and a performance at the Bolshoi
Theater.
   Primarily because of security, the number of Americans attending
the summit is larger than normally would attend a meeting such as
the annual economic summit, which is being held June 19-21 in
Toronto, Canada.
   ``When you are having a meeting in Moscow, you really have to
take extraordinary security precautions, precautions you would
ordinarily not have to take in Tokyo or London,'' said Robert E.
Lamb, the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security.
   But the State Department's budget cuts mean the agency may send
fewer people to Moscow than it did to Reagan's first superpower
summit in Geneva in November 1985, said one official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Diplomats and White House aides will be joined in Moscow by
engineers, technicians, guards, cooks, stewards and support staff.
   The U.S. Embassy in Moscow differs from most embassies, where
foreign nationals cook, clean, answer telephones, make repairs and
run errands for the diplomats and their families. In October 1986,
260 Soviets were removed from the embassy as part of a series of
diplomatic expulsions between Washington and Moscow.
   To compensate for the short-staffing in Moscow, the U.S.
government will send people to help out at the embassy and at Spaso
House. Lamb's staff has sent technicians to assure secure rooms
inside the embassy, as well as additional American guards to keep a
24-hour-a-day watch on the facilities, he said.

   Comedian Whoopi Goldberg is expected to remain
hospitalized for several days because of complications from a
bacterial infection, a spokeswoman said.
   Ms. Goldberg was forced to cancel appearances in Pittsburgh,
Chicago and Boston after she was hospitalized last week with a high

   Ms. Goldberg likely will remain hospitalized a few more days,
Ms. Leonard said Monday.
   ``She's OK. She's fine,'' Ms. Leonard said. ``I spoke with her

   The name of the hospital in which Ms. Goldberg is staying has
not been released.
   Ms. Goldberg, 37, is nearing the end of a six-week, 12-city tour
of her one-woman show, ``Living on the Edge of Chaos,'' a series of

<HEAD>Delvalle Opposes US Negotiating Tactics With Noriega</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is now facing
protests from exiled Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle for
its handling of negotiations to get Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
resign.
   At the same time, the administration is displaying weariness
with the prolonged negotiating process and said it hopes an
agreement can be reached before President Reagan leaves Wednesday
for the Moscow summit.
   In a statement issued Monday from hiding, Delvalle and his
allies said the negotiations with Noriega, as reported in the
media, ``would mortgage the future of Panama for a long time to
come.''
   The statement was issued through the pro-Delvalle Panamanian
Embassy in Washington by Delvalle and Panama's ``democratic
forces.''
   The administation's chief Panama negotiator, Michael G. Kozak,
was ordered back to Panama late Sunday by the White House to
continue negotiations with Noriega even though Vice President
George Bush has counseled against any dealings with drug dealers,
whether foreign or domestic.
   Delvalle was forced out of office after he tried to fire Noriega
as head of the Panamanian Defense Forces. Delvalle continues to
receive U.S. backing as the legitimate president of Panama, but the
statement indicated he believes the administration has made too
many concessions in its negotiations with Noriega.
   It said Noriega would be able to to continue to exercise
authority even after resigning as defense chief unless the Defense
Forces are revamped.
   U.S. officials who have described the negotiating process have
not suggested that a major overhaul of the Defense Forces is
contemplated.
   The embassy statement also demanded the ``immediate exit'' of
Noriega from Panama, suggesting unhappiness with the August
departure date now planned.
   The U.S. officials have said that, as foreseen in the
negotiations, Noriega would leave Panama in August and return after
the May 1989 presidential elections. They said Noriega would have a
hand in the selection of an interim government which would serve
until after the elected government takes office.
   The embassy statement called for Delvalle's reinstatment as
president and for the formation of a government of national
reconciliation.
   Noriega, the de facto Panamanian ruler who is under
drug-smuggling indictments in the United States, has successfully
resisted prolonged U.S. pressure to force him out.
   There is a sharp division within the administration over what
kind of deal Noriega should be offered, and particularly whether
the government should go ahead with an offer to drop the drug
charges.
   Reagan said nothing had been settled and that there was not a
timetable for concluding a deal. But Under Secretary of State
Michael Armacost said it would be desirable to reach a settlement
before Reagan's departure for Finland on Wednesday. He is due in
Moscow on Sunday.
   Reagan, asked whether he was prepared to drop the drug charges
against the Panamanian general, said, ``Nothing's been settled.
It's still in the works.''
   Kozak, the deputy assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, spent the weekend in Washington after
nearly a month of negotiations in Panama. Kozak briefed Reagan and
other high-level officials and returned to Panama Monday morning.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Kozak ``is
prepared to continue discussions.''

<HEAD>George Hamilton Says Sunning Recharges His Battery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite lampoons in ``Doonesbury,'' actor George
Hamilton says he lives to tan.
   ``For me it's direct energy. It's like plugging my battery in.
It isn't just the actual feeling I get,'' the tawny actor said in
June's Vogue magazine.
   And he doesn't worry about the damage it may cause, either.
   ``If anybody should be a piece of parchment, it's me. My skin,
though, is as smooth as anybody's who hasn't been in the sun,''
said Hamilton, whose sunning passion provides Garry Trudeau's
``Doonesbury'' comic strip with plenty of fodder. One of Trudeau's
characters regularly attends ``The George Hamilton Cocoa Butter
Open.''
   The actor recalls a time in London when he was staying at the
Grosvenor House Hotel, and the weather was typically English.
   ``All of a sudden the sun came out,'' Hamilton said. ``And it
was hitting a spot on the wall outside my room. So I climbed out
onto the ledge and positioned myself for maybe half an hour to get
some sun.''
   A crowd quickly gathered and one woman began shouting, ``Look at
'im. 'E's gonna jump,'' Hamilton said. ``Soon there were 20 people
gathered below thinking I'm trying to commit suicide.
   ``All I wanted was a little sun.''

   Tens of thousands of striking
school teachers converged on the capital to press demands for
higher wages.
   The 40,000 teachers marched on the capital Monday, five days
after beginning a nationwide walkout to demand a minimum wage of
640 australs ($90) a month for the country's 500,000 primary and
secondary school teachers.
   An earlier strike that began March 14 at the opening of the
Argentine public school year lasted six weeks until the government
ordered teachers to begin work while negotiations continued.
Negotiations later broke off.
   Union leader Marcos Garcetti and Labor Minister Ideler Tonelli
negotiated for an hour on Monday without reaching an agreement,
union sources said.
   About 7.2 million schoolchildren aged three to 18 have been
affected by the walkout, which has generally not affected private
schools.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first national standards on who can
operate a train, and other steps strengthening the government's
hand for dealing with railroad accidents, are awaiting final
congressional approval.
   The House approved the legislation by voice vote Monday and sent
it to the Senate, where approval is expected this week.
   The measure is an outgrowth of the Jan. 4, 1987, collision of an
Amtrak passenger train with three connected Conrail locomotives in
Chase, Md. The crash killed 16 people and injured 175 others. Two
of the Conrail crewmen admitted later that they had been smoking
marijuana in the cab.
   The legislation does not include a requirement for the mandatory
random testing of railroad workers, which is strongly opposed by
rail unions. That language is part of another bill that is mired
down by differences between the House and Senate.
   It does order the Transportation Department to set up a national
system for licensing train engineers, give the government the power
to penalize individual workers _ not just railroad companies _ for
safety violations, and increase the federal fines that can be
imposed.
   The bill's passage brought mixed reactions from railroad and
labor union officials.
   William H. Dempsey, president of the Association of American
Railroads, praised parts of the measure, but said it also should
have required mandatory random drug testing of railroad workers.
   ``It cannot be said that the ... bill adequately addresses the
issue of rail safety'' without that language, Dempsey said in a
written statement.
   James Kennedy, executive secretary-treasurer of the Railway
Labor Executives Association, said parts of the bill were good, but
added that it should have raised fines further and offered more
protections for employees who report workplace problems.
   ``It certainly doesn't go far enough,'' said Kennedy, whose
organization represents 300,000 railroad workers.
   Under the licensing program, applicants' automobile driving
licenses would be examined for drug and alcohol convictions. An
individual whose record shows such convictions could receive an
engineer's license only if he or she had completed an approved
rehabilitation program.
   The bill also requires the Transportation Department to issue
rules forbidding the disabling of safety devices, a practice that
is not now illegal.
   Instruments to record a train's operating data, similar to
``black boxes'' in aircraft, would be required within three years.
And automatic braking devices, common on Amtrak trains but missing
on many freight trains, would be required in the busy Northeast
Corridor.
   The maximum civil fine imposed for safety violations would be
increased from $2,500 to $20,000 for grossly negligent breaches of
the law.
   ``This legislation takes a significant new stride in enhancing
safety,'' said John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, which originated the bill.
   The House and Senate each had approved earlier versions of the
legislation. Negotiators from the two chambers agreed last Thursday
to the compromise bill.

<HEAD>Birth Control Device Gets FDA Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cervical cap, a birth control device that
works something like a diaphragm, has won Food and Drug
Administration approval for prescription in the United States.
   It already is widely used in Britain and other countries and has
been tried by about 50,000 U.S. women in clinical trials sponsored
by the National Institutes of Health.
   The cap, approved Monday, is a flexible, cup-like rubber device
about 1{ inches in diameter that is to be fitted by a physician to
cover the base of the woman's cervix.
   After the initial fitting, the cap can be inserted and removed
by the user and can remain in place for 48 hours, as opposed to a
maximum of 12 hours for the diaphragm.
   Both devices are to be used with a spermicidal cream or jelly,
but the cap does not require additional spermicide before each
instance of intercourse.
   The NIH clinical study found the cap to be about 85 percent
effective in preventing pregnancy, comparable to the diaphragm.
   The approved labeling to be supplied physicians states the cap
is to be prescribed only for women with normal Pap tests, which is
a test for cervical cancer, and that they are to return for a
follow-up Pap test after using the cap for three months.
   The labeling also will caution that the cap, like the diaphragm
and contraceptive sponge, may slightly increase the risk of toxic
shock syndrome.
   Unlike the diaphragm, the cervical cap was not widely used in
the United States in 1977, when Congress ordered the FDA to
strengthen its regulation of birth control and other medical
devices.
   Because they were already in extensive use at that time,
diaphragms and condoms were given ``grandfather'' FDA approval time
without the stringent testing subsequently required of new medical
devices.
   The National Women's Health Network, an advocacy group, has been
pushing for approval of the cap since 1978, arguing that it is as
safe and effective as the diaphragm and offers advantages that many
women will find appealing.
   Rather than covering the entire roof of the vagina as a
diaphragm does, the cap fits over the tip of the cervix and thus
allows for more sensitivity during intercourse.

<TEXT>
   The government's nationwide case against
members of the Hells Angels could be jeopardized by a mistrial
declared in one case after a disclosure that the chief informant
lied about his history of cocaine use.
   Informant Anthony Tait had testified that he took cocaine twice
in his life and also used marijuana but stopped because ``they made
me violently ill.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert Schnacke on Monday declared a
mistrial in the case of Michael Lessard, 39, a member of the
motorcycle gang's Oakland chapter, after learning Tait admitted to
the FBI in 1985 that he had been a regular cocaine user.
   Lessard is charged with four counts of illegally possessing
explosives.
   ``It's going to show that Tait's not to be trusted,'' said
defense attorney Richard Hove. ``He's capable of lying at any time.
   ``It also demonstrates that the government has let him go ahead
and lie till somebody's conscience decided that they had to say
something about it.'' Assistant U.S. Attorney John Stephen Graham
said the disclosure about Tait wouldn't have any significant effect
on the government's case. Graham heads the Drug Enforcement Task
Force that is coordinating the Hells Angels prosecutions.
   Defense lawyers ``have been doing everything they can in all of
the trials up to this point to put Tait himself on trial, to divert
attention from the fact that somebody else actually is charged with
a crime,'' Graham said.
   Tait worked for three years as an undercover informant in the
Hells Angels. He has received $63,000 in fees from the government
and is the chief witness against all 41 of the gang members who
were charged last November with drugs or weapons violations.
Several members already have been convicted.
   The defendants include Ralph ``Sonny'' Barger, founder of the
Oakland chapter, who is awaiting trial in Kentucky in the
explosives conspiracy case.
   Lessard faces a trial in Kentucky on charges that he gave
explosives to Tait, who testified they were to be used to kill
members of a rival gang, the Outlaws.
   After Tait's testimony about his drug use, Graham sent a letter
to defense lawyers, describing Tait's February 1985 interview with
FBI agent Peter Flanagan in Alaska, where Tait had infiltrated a
Hells Angels chapter. Graham realized he was required to disclose
evidence that could be useful in their cases, he said.
   In the letter, Graham quoted Flanagan as saying Tait ``advised
that although his current narcotics use is limited to marijuana ...
he did previously have a problem with cocaine use up until 1980.''
Tait said he managed to ``completely kick the cocaine habit,'' the
letter quoted Flanagan as saying.

<HEAD>Mulroney Government Introduces Historic Free-Trade Legislation</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lede prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong opposition from Ontario lawmakers is
expected when the government debates its historic Free Trade
Agreement with the United States.
   The government was to introduce the legislation to implement the
agreement today, two years after Canada and the United States
embarked on talks to create a North American free-trade zone.
   The inch-thick bill would eliminate tariffs and reduce other
barriers in nearly every facet of the $150 billion (U.S.) a year
trading partnership. The changes would start Jan. 1, 1989 and be
phased in over a 10-year period.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and President Reagan signed the
agreement Jan. 2.
   Trade Minister John Crosbie was confident that Mulroney's
Progressive Conservative Party can push the legislation through
because it controls 208 seats in the 282-member House of Commons.
   ``We have the majority of members and therefore Parliament,
after a reasonable time for debate, has to make a decision. We will
use the rules to see that it does,'' Crosbie said last week.
   But the deal faces many hurdles, both in Ottawa and Washington.
   The U.S. Senate Finance Committee approved the accord last week,
but it attached provisions that embarrassed Canada. The senators
demanded that Mulroney guarantee compliance by Canada's 10
provinces and called for new restrictions on Canadian plywood and
lobsters.
   Crosbie fired off protest notes to Washington and said the
plywood and lobster issues could provide the first test case for
the binational trade panels the agreement would create.
   A bigger headache for Mulroney is opposition within Canada,
where polls show public opinion split on free trade.
   Both main opposition parties _ the Liberals and New Democrats _
are against the pact and have vowed to use every parliamentary tool
to block implementing legislation.
   ``We think it is a terrible deal for the long-range history of
Canada, and we will do everything we can to stop it,'' said New
Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent, who claims Mulroney traded
away sovereignty in exchange for temporary relief from U.S.
protectionism.
   The Liberals control Parliament's upper chamber, the appointed
Senate, which has delaying and amending powers.
   The biggest threat to the deal, however, comes from the Liberal
premier of Ontario Province, David Peterson, who says he will take
the federal government to court if it tries to override provincial
jurisdiction.
   ``We gave away an enormous amount and we got nothing,'' Peterson
said in a recent interview.
   The only province that actively opposes free trade, Ontario is
also Canada's industrial and financial powerhouse with the 11th
largest economic output in the world.
   Peterson's immediate concern is 10,000 jobs in the grape-growing
and wine industry, centered in the fertile Niagara region. The Free
Trade Agreement calls on Canada to eliminate a protectionist
65-percent markup on U.S. wine and liquor over a seven-year period,
and Peterson refuses to do so.
   The federal government is empowered under the Constitution to
enter into international treaties and feels confident it would win
a court challenge. But litigation would delay implementation of the
agreement and anger Congress.
   Officials said the legislation will declare Ottawa's right to
force provincial compliance in some cases, but Mulroney has to be
careful not to antagonize provinces such as Quebec and Alberta who
guard their own powers over energy, language and other matters.
   Mulroney is currently on a five-day tour of Europe, where there
is concern that the Canada-U.S. accord will throw up barriers to
outsiders.
   ``There is considerable concern within Europe about the
possibility that the world is splitting into regional trade
blocs,'' DeAnne Julius, director of economics at the Royal
Institute of International Affairs in London, said on Monday. But
Mulroney emerged from a meeting with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher saying that she endorses the Free Trade Agreement.
   ``I find it strange that any European economist could say a word
against a bilateral treaty such as ours when the very basis of
European prosperity is this sort of approach,'' Mulroney said.
   Sylvia Ostry, Canada's multilateral trade negotiator, said
Canada and the United States were not creating a new ``common
market'' but simply relaxing bilateral trade restrictions. ``It
sends out a very positive signal about the American commitment to
trade liberalization,'' she said in an interview.
   The Economic Council of Canada forecasts the accord will create
250,000 jobs and 2.5 percent additional growth in Canada over 10
years.

   John David House, one of the founders of the
110,000-member United Rubber Workers union, has died at age 83.
   House, who was involved in the union for five decades, died
Sunday at Akron General Medical Center, the union announced Monday.
   A native of Cleveland, Ga., House moved to Akron after he
graduated from high school and went to work for B.F. Goodrich. When
Goodrich laid him off, House worked for a short period for
Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. and then became a tire builder for
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
   House was at the Portage Hotel in Akron when the URW was founded
on Sept. 12, 1935. He was the first president of Local 2 in Akron,
serving from 1935 to 1940, and served in several other positions
with the union before he retired Dec. 31, 1969.
   House, a widower, is survived by his son, John Jr. of Naples,
Fla., and a daughter, Eloise Hall, of Akron.

   High credit costs plus heavy overhead and sour
loans drained $300 million from the Federal Land Bank in Jackson,
Miss., in three years and finally drove it into insolvency, a
federal official says.
   ``As of last Friday the bank's liabilities exceeded its earning
assets by approximately $500 million,'' Farm Credit Assistance
Board President Eric P. Thor told a Senate panel Monday.
   He placed losses at $300 million in three years. He blamed high
operating expenses, plus the third heaviest credit costs in the
Farm Credit System and troubled loans totaling 40 percent of the
$1.68 billion portfolio.
   In addition, he said, the bank had sought $410 million to $610
million in aid early this year but never came up with a workable
business plan. He told reporters Jackson officials provided a list
of borrowers that was ``inaccurate and incomplete.''
   ``It seems you have indicated a lot of what you might call poor
management practices down there,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
   ``I would say that's a fair assessment,'' replied Thor, whose
agency was created by Congress last year as part of a Farm Credit
System bailout.
   The Jackson institution is one of 12 federal land banks in the
Farm Credit System, a $50 billion network of cooperatively owned
lenders little known to city folk outside financial circles but
long a bulwark of U.S. agriculture.
   Federal regulators closed the doors of the billion-dollar
institution Friday and placed it in receivership. It reopened
Monday to provide borrowers with information. Government officials
hope interim credit for borrowers can be arranged without much
delay.
   But that would last only until the receiver, Ronald E. Watkins
of Tulsa, Okla., phases the long-tottering bank out of existence.
   Farmers whose credit is good are likely to find another Farm
Credit System institution moving in to serve the Jackson bank's
area of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, regulators said.
   They also sought to quell fears of a quick rash of foreclosures
on the Jackson bank's large stockpile of non-performing loans. They
said borrowers' rights provisions included in a congressional
bailout approved by Congress last year would be enforced in full.
   Regulators also offered repeated assurances that borrowers'
stock in the cooperatively owned bank would be retired at face
value and creditors of the institution would be paid in full under
provisions of the bailout.
   Several lawmakers expressed dismay that the situation in Jackson
had been allowed to deteriorate until the bank was beyond help.
   They also pressed officials not to allow the same thing happen
to land banks in other parts of the country.
   ``We want to avoid another Jackson in Omaha,'' Sen. Tom Dascle,
D-S.D., said.
   ``We could find ourselves in the same place that Jacksonville is
in, which is not in the interest of farmers or taxpayers,'' said
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, whose state also is served by the Omaha
Federal Land Bank.

<HEAD>Study: Testicular Cancer Treatment Can Be Cut 25 Percent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The extent of chemotherapy needed to cure
testicular cancer can safely be reduced by 25 percent, sparing men
from some of the misery of the effective but difficult treatment, a
study has found.
   Experts say the discovery represents another advance in the
treatment of one of the few highly curable adult cancers.
   Cancer of the testicles is rare, accounting for about 1 percent
of all male malignancies. However, it is the most common cancer
among men between the ages of 15 and 35.
   In the study, Dr. Lawrence H. Einhorn of Indiana University
found that the standard course of chemotherapy can be cut from four
months to three and still cure about 95 percent of patients.
   ``We can now eliminate that fourth course of therapy, reducing
costs, side effects and patient inconvenience,'' he said Monday at
the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   The drug cisplatin, used in combination with other chemotherapy
medicines, produces a variety of unpleasant side effects, including
hair loss, nausea, vomiting, weakness and numbness of the hands and
feet.
   ``For a patient, the last month of chemotherapy may be
devastating,'' said Dr. Nicholas Vogelzang of the University of
Chicago. ``Being able to eliminate it may allow a much higher
quality of life.''
   Until a decade ago, doctors gave chemotherapy to victims of
testicular cancer for two years. Then a study showed that four
months of therapy worked just as well.
   A four-month course of treatment has been the standard therapy
since then.
   Einhorn's comparison study was conducted between 1984 and 1987
on 184 men. The cure rates were identical, regardless of whether
they received three or four months of treatment.
   Men who are initially freed of testicular cancer are generally
considered to be cured, since the disease rarely returns.
   In this study, 97 percent of the men were initially freed of
cancer. The disease recurred in 5 percent of them, although many
may be cured by a second or third battery of treatment.
   The study was conducted on men with so-called ``favorable
prognosis'' cancer, which has spread but resulted in relatively
small growths in the lungs or lymph glands. About two-thirds of all
patients fall into this category.
   According to the American Cancer Society, testicular cancer will
be diagnosed in 5,600 men this year, and 350 will die of the
disease.
   Also at the meeting Monday, the National Cancer Institute said
it will try to double over the next four years the number of
patients who receive experimental treatments in an effort to speed
up the search for ways to stop the biggest cancer killers.
   Largely because of physicians' reluctance to enroll their
patients in cancer experiments, it may take 10 years or longer to
assess the value of promising new therapies, officials said.
   ``We are not getting enrolled anywhere near the number of
patients we need to get answers within a reasonable period of
time,'' said Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr., director of the institute.
   Currently, about 25,000 cancer patients each year are enrolled
in treatment experiments, known as clinical trials, that are
sponsored by the institute.
   Through appeals to doctors and directly to the public, the
institute hopes to double this by 1992.

<HEAD>Bid To Compel Noriega To Appear In Congress Fails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators of the governing
coalition tried without success to compel Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to appear in congress to report on talks with the United
States.
   Twenty-seven legislators voted for the motion Monday. Eight
voted against it and 12 abstained. Forty-seven of the body's 67
members were on hand for the session of the Legislative Assembly,
as the unicameral legislature is called.
   The congress is empowered to call before it any official, but
such a measure must be approved by two-thirds of those present.
   Had it been passed, the motion would have compelled Noriega, who
is commander of the 15,000-member Defense Forces and de facto ruler
of Panama, to appear before the lawmakers to respond to specific
questions.
   Among the questions included in the resolution as proposed by
Luis Gomez, a lawmaker of the Revolutionary Democratic Party, or
PRD, were:
   ``What has been proposed by the North American negotiators?
   ``What has been proposed by the Panamanian negotiators?
   ``Why is the United States participating in these negotiations
when it persists in not recognizing the legitimate government of
Panama?
   ``What is the basic objective pursued by the Panamanian
negotiators, and what relation does it have with the national task
of recovering our complete sovereignty and control of the (Panama)
Canal in the year 2000?
   ``How has the fact that you have been formally accused of
participating in drug smuggling to the United States affected your
decision to carry out these negotiations? Has the United States
offered to lift these indictments? In exchange for what concessions
from you?''
   A coalition called the National Democratic Union ostensibly
governs Panama. It comprises the pro-military Revolutionary
Democratic Party, the Republican Party and the Labor Party.
   Eight other legislators representing the Revolutionary
Democratic Party, the Laborites and the Republicans were
co-sponsors of Gomez's resolution.
   Most abstentions and votes against the resolution came from
members of the opposition _ Christian Democrats and members of the
Authentic Panamenist Party.
   Representatives of Noriega have been involved for most of May in
talks with Reagan administration envoy Michael Kozak in an effort
to resolve the crisis in U.S.-Panamanian relatins. Washington
insists that the general, who was indicted in Florida in February
on federal drug-smuggling and money-laundering charges, resign his
post and leave the country, at least temporarily.
   Neither Noriega nor his associates have spelled out his position
explicitly. But the general has said repeatedly there can be no
solution as long as what he calls U.S. aggression against Panama
continues.
   He says sanctions imposed by the Reagan administration
constitute economic aggression. Noriega contends that the
deployment of nearly 2,000 soldiers in recent months to reinforce
the 10,000 already stationed in U.S. military institutions along
the canal constitutes psychological aggression.
   He also has demanded that Washington ``respect'' the government
of President Manuel Solis Palma. Solis replaced Eric Delvalle, who
was removed from the presidency by the National Assembly on Feb. 26
after trying to fire Noriega. Washington continues to recognize
Delvalle, who remains in hiding in Panama, as the country's
president.
   Asked by The Associated Press 10 days ago if he was considering
retiring in August _ which has been suggested as a feasible date
for stepping down _ Noriega said the date of his retirement is none
of Washington's business.
   His spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez said Noriega could continue as
commander for ``several more years.''
   Noriega denies the drug charges, contending they are politically
motivated.
   He says Washington intends to replace him with a less
nationalistic leader who would consent to a strong U.S. military
presence in Panama well into the next century.
   The 1977 Panama Canal Treaty between the United States and
Panama obliges Washington to hand over to Panama complete control
of the waterway and U.S. military installations by midday Dec. 31,
1999.
   Kozak returned to Panama on Monday following a weekend meeting
with Reagan and the president's top Cabinet members and advisers.
   Neither the U.S. Embassy nor Panamanian officials would comment
on what meetings the envoy has planned in coming days.
   Precisely what the U.S. is offering Noriega has not been
disclosed, though reports from Washington have indicated the
president is inclined to authorize dismissal of the indictments
against Noriega if that would entice him to give up power.

<HEAD>State Department Stopped Defense Fund for Hasenfus, Attorney Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department persuaded the wife of
Eugene Hasenfus not to form a defense fund following her husband's
capture in Nicaragua when a U.S. plane carrying arms for the
Contras was shot down, an attorney says.
   The accusation that Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams
and another State Department official interceded within days of the
Oct. 5, 1986, crash of a C-123 transport plane was made by an
attorney representing the Hasenfuses in a civil suit filed Monday
in federal court.
   Los Angeles attorney Brian R. Strange said Abrams and William P.
Schofield telephoned Sally Hasenfus to tell her the operators of
the private resupply network would pay for her husband's legal
expenses following his capture by the Sandinista government.
   Tape recordings that Mrs. Hasenfus made of the telephone
conversations provide ``undisputable evidence of these
representations,'' Strange said in a telephone interview after the
lawsuit was filed.
   State Department spokeswoman Ellen Bork said she could not
comment on the assertion because the case is in litigation.
   The lawsuit originally was filed last fall in California state
court. That action was dismissed hours before the new case was
brought in U.S. District Court in Washington, Strange said.
   The breach-of-contract suit against Southern Air Transport,
Corporate Air Services and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V.
Secord charges that Hasenfus' employers broke their promises to pay
his legal expenses after his capture in Nicaragua.
   Hakim and Secord, defendants in the Iran-Contra arms and money
conspiracy case along with fired National Security Council aide
Oliver L. North and former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, ran the secret Contra resupply network during a time
when American military aid to the rebels was banned by law.
   Southern Air, once a CIA proprietary company, provided planes
for ferrying arms to the Nicaraguan rebels during the aid cutoff.
   The lawsuit charges that Corporate Air Services, which hired
Hasenfus as a cargo handler in July 1986, was a front created for
the operation by Southern Air.
   Abrams testified before Congress after the crash that there was
no U.S. involvement in the plane, which was carrying rifles,
ammunition and grenade launchers to the Contras.
   Later, Abrams was forced to admit he was ``completely wrong'' in
making this assertion.
   The suit alleges that U.S. officials were told by operators of
the covert arms supply network that they would pay for Hasenfus's
legal expenses following his capture.
   These officials, who were not specifically identified in the
complaint but were alleged by Strange to be Abrams and Schofield,
in turn urged Mrs. Hasenfus and her friends not to publicly solicit
funds for her husband's legal defense in Nicaragua, where he was
charged with terrorism.
   Mrs. Hasenfus relied on the promises relayed by Abrams and
Schofield that her husband's legal bills would be paid by his
employers, the lawsuit said. But those bills were never paid, the
lawsuit contends, forcing the Hasenfus family to deplete their
life's savings.
   ``Sally and Eugene face financial ruin, including potential
foreclosure of their home and possible forced sale of their
assets,'' the lawsuit said.
   Strange said Schofield, who was assigned to the Nicaragua desk
in 1986, telephoned Mrs. Hasenfus several times within days of the
crash and that Abrams made one call himself.
   ``They told Sally Hasenfus they were in contact with Gene's
employers and that everything would be taken care of,'' Strange
said. ``They induced them not to go forward with a fund that was
being raised.''
   Hasenfus, of Marinette, Wis., was tried and convicted and
received a 30-year prison sentence. But on Dec. 17, 1986, he was
pardoned by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and allowed to
return to the United States.

   A gunman walked into a bowling alley
card room Monday and opened fire, killing one person and critically
wounding another before fleeing and then fatally wounding himself,
police said.
   Rodney Morrow, 34, of Sacramento, was carrying two guns when he
walked into the South Bowl shortly after 4 p.m. and fired two shots
without hitting anyone, authorities said.
   He then walked into the card room and shot an employee and
customer twice and then shot the employee again as he lay on the
floor, said police Sgt. Bob Burns.
   He said something to the effect of ``You are the one I want'' as
he shot the employee, Burns said.
   The gunman then walked out of the bowling alley.
   A police officer on patrol heard a radio report of the shooting,
spotted a man with a gun in his hand running along a busy street
and chased the gunman into a parking lot, Burns said.
   The gunman fired at the patrol car, knocking a large hole in the
windshield, and then shot himself in the head, Burns said.
   The police officer, James Kammerer, suffered minor cuts to his
head and right hand from flying glass, according to Burns.
   The bowling alley employee, who was killed, was identified as
Robert McGlone Jr., 30, of Sacramento. The customer, Carey Unruh,
was in critical condition at University Medical Center, police said.

<HEAD>Veteran of Farm Workers Union Organizes Western States for Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Yberra, heading Michael Dukakis'
presidential campaign in the West, says he is taking a page from
the farm workers' struggles of the 1960s and '70s as he organizes
California for the Democratic front-runner.
   The highest-ranking Hispanic in the Dukakis campaign, Yberra is
a veteran of the United Farm Workers union and its boycott
campaigns. He is son-in-law of the union's longtime leader, Cesar
Chavez, and his former aide.
   Yberra directed Dukakis' campaign in seven other Western states
earlier this year where Dukakis won.
   In California he is concentrating on building an organization
both to counter Jesse Jackson's plans to outspend Dukakis on
television ads, and to lay the groundwork for the fall campaign
against Republican George Bush.
   ``For many years the conventional wisdom has said California is
too large to have a grassroots political organization,'' and that
only big spending on TV is effective, Yberra said.
   ``Campaigns often just come in here to raise money,'' he said.
``You have to go back to the Bobby Kennedy campaign and George
McGovern campaign of '68 and '72, to where the farm workers union
had a lot of involvement and turned out numbers of people in
certain areas of the state to contribute significantly to those two
victories.''
   ``Years later, there are a number of Democratic activists who
came out of that period and experience ... and who take the same
things we used, the same methods we used in the successful
boycotts, into other areas.''
   California state Democratic Chairman Peter Kelly, a Los Angeles
attorney, said the United Farm Workers has produced Democratic
strategists and organizers for several successful recent campaigns.
   ``They ran all those boycott campaigns, and that transferred
them into politics,'' Kelley said.
   Like many in the Dukakis campaign, Yberra met the Massachusetts
governor while a student at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government,
where Dukakis taught after losing re-election in 1978.
   Yberra, 39, whose name is pronounced E-bear-a, was from San
Diego and had left college without graduating to volunteer with the
farm workers. He was recruited to attend the Kennedy school and
earned a masters degree in public administration.
   ``I was one of those rare ones at the Kennedy School who comes
from where I came from,'' he said. ``I had Dukakis as my professor
for three courses, and sat in on another. I had him for almost half
what I did there. I was that impressed with him.''
   He had been Chavez's administrative assistant for three years in
the early 1970s, when he married Chavez's daughter, Anna, and later
held jobs in the administration of California Gov. Jerry Brown. He
worked in Brown's 1980 presidential campaign, and for Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., after Brown quit the race.
   Dukakis relied on organizational strength in several Western
states where he defeated Jackson and other rivals, including some
where he did not campaign.
   Dukakis won Arizona without a visit there, and won Colorado's
caucuses after a visit of only a few hours, while Jackson spent two
days and drew massive crowds everywhere he went.
   ``We had supporters calling us, worried,'' Yberra said,
recalling the days Jackson drew throngs in Colorado. ``We'd say no,
just keep down the line, do the program, stay consistent. We're
going to be OK.''
   As it turned out, he said, on caucus day Dukakis' count proved
more accurate than the state party's early projections. ``That's
how good our organization was,'' he said.

   If Menda McKenzie was waiting for a sign to
decide whether to marry Bruce Lear, she got one.
   Roses in hand, Bruce ``B.T.'' Lear showed up at Miss McKenzie's
office and asked her to come outside.
   In front of the building, a mobile red and white sign asked:
``Menda McKenzie will you marry me! B.T.''
   ``I didn't even answer. I just laughed,'' Miss McKenzie said of
Friday's proposal. ``Someone from the third floor yelled, `What did
you say?' And I said `Yes.'''
   Miss McKenzie, a part-time nutrition aide, and Lear are seniors
at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
   ``I was really nervous,'' Lear said. ``You spend your whole life
feeling kind of young _ it's always the other people getting
engaged. There's a seriousness to that kind of commitment. We're
both serious about it.''
   However, he said, he didn't want a traditional proposal.
   ``I wanted to do something kind of fun, but not tasteless,'' he
said.

   Horns blasted and a sign unfurled for an

   ``I felt great because I never won anything,'' said Mark Bodal,

   As Mark approached the boat Circle Line XII on Monday, a banner
opened noting the 40 millionth passenger, ``the horns went off and
the bells rang and he was very, very excited,'' said spokesman
Richard Basini.
   Mark got to ring the excursion boat's bell, spin the wheel and

   The United States has avenged three
straight losses to Canada to finally triumph in the international
scallop shucking contest.
   In becoming the first U.S. shucker to win, Jimmy Jardin of New
Bedford beat two Canadians who had won in the last three years.
   Jardin scored 184.25 points, while another U.S. contestant, Mark
Picanso, came in second with 183.25 points in Sunday's fifth annual
competition.
   The four men donned long rubber aprons and gloves and warmed up
by shucking a practice round of 25 scallops. Then 200 scallops were
carefully counted out, and hands began flying.
   A team of Canadian and U.S. judges inspected the scallop meats,
and deducted points for nicks and sloppy cuts.
   ``I'm a natural,'' Jardin said before the competition, held at
the State Pier as part of the International Commercial Fisheries
show. ``I've only been fishing for a year and a half.''
   Jardin said he and Picanso develop their talents by competing
daily as crewmates aboard the fishing vessel Raider. Picanso beat
Jardin on Friday at a U.S. shucking competition.
   ``We work side by side, and we drive each other all day long,''
Jardin said.

<HEAD>Study Says 1.5 Billion People Without Clean Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1.5 billion people around the world
still cannot get safe water, according to a World Bank study that
recommends putting more women in charge of community water supplies.
   ``Where women are trained to manage and maintain community water
systems, they often perform better than men, because they are less
likely to migrate, are more accustomed to voluntary work, and
because they are more trusted to administer funds honestly,'' says
the study, made available this week.
   It was written by John Briscoe, now the bank's senior economist
for Brazil, and David de Ferranti, in charge of population matters
in its Southern Africa Department. The bank is the major source of
aid loans for almost 120 countries.
   The study estimates that in the 1960s only about 20 percent of
people in poor countries had access to safe water. The authors
think that now it is about 50 percent. According to the World
Health Organization, the best coverage is in Latin America and the
Caribbean, followed by the Asia and Pacific region, with Africa
bringing up the rear.
   ``Recent in-depth assessments in East and West Africa revealed
that the population actually using improved water supply schemes
was only one-third of the population reported to have access,'' the
report says.
   Governments are apparently spending about $1.5 billion a year on
rural water supply, including foreign aid from the United States
and other countries, but the report says it would take three to
five times that much to get safe water to everyone by the year 2000.
   Because fetching water has long been considered women's work in
many lands, men attach less importance to the time and effort it
takes, the report says.
   In the lowlands of Lesotho, in southern Africa, it found that 30
percent of families spend more than two and a half hours a day
collecting water.
   ``Because drawing water is a woman's task, men have few
incentives to carry out repairs and many water systems no longer
function,'' it says.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development looked into the
situation in Kenya, Peru, Tanzania and Thailand and found
importance attached to getting safe water for a variety of reasons
in addition to saving health and time: home gardens, livestock,
brick making _ and beer-brewing.
   According to the report, local people must have the main
responsibility and bear much of the cost.
   ``For some these ideas _ especially the implication that
disadvantaged rural people should pay for improved water services _
will seem a hardhearted, commercial approach,'' it said.
   ``The evidence, however, is now in: the worst possible approach
is seeing poor people as having no resources. ...Promises of free
service for all too often result, in practice, in some service for
a few and little or none for most.''

   It was perhaps the ultimate inside Washington
scene _ a Broadway play about arms control being put on in front of
the secretary of state, the negotiator whose action formed the
basis of the production, and a dozen members of the Senate fresh
from debating an arms control treaty.
   And the consensus was that while ``A Walk in the Woods'' is an
entertaining production, it wasn't like the real thing.
   ``It bore no resemblance to reality, that's what made it so
good,'' Secretary of State George P. Shultz said after viewing the
dark comedy. ``It was interesting, it gave you a lot of laughs, and
it took your mind off your work.''
   In a case of carrying coals to Newcastle, the producers of the
play offered to bring it to Washington for a production at the
Library of Congress, across the street from the Capitol.
   The one-time-only production was sponsored by several senators,
including Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee. Pell said he thought the production ``dramatizes the
human side of what is too often a faceless bureaucracy.''
   The two-person play starred Sam Waterston as the American
negotiator and Robert Prosky as his Soviet counterpart. Written by
Lee Blessing, it was loosely based on the private 1982 talk between
Paul Nitze and Yuri Kvitsinsky.
   That Geneva discussion produced an agreement between the two men
on the framework for a medium-range missile treaty, but the plan
was later rejected by both governments.
   Nitze said he was entertained, but agreed with Shultz. ``It
didn't bear any relationship to anything we talked about. I didn't
hear anything said on stage that was anything like my talk.''
   ``You had a certain amount of theatric license,'' Nitze said
with a laugh, noting that in the play, the Soviet negotiator was
several decades older than the young American. In reality, the
reverse was true.
   But like the play, the private talk between Nitze and Kvitsinsky
produced no lasting agreement.
   ``Yes, it's true we certainly didn't succeed, but it was fun to
try,'' said Nitze.
   The Nitze-Kvitsinsky talks were part of the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces (INF) negotiations leading to the treaty now before
the Senate.
   Maynard Glitman, Nitze's successor, also attended the
production. His review: ``It's a dramatization, and while it's
good, it's not like reality.''
   All three men said they enjoyed the play, precisely because it
bore little resemblance to reality.
   ``It was a good characterization and a lot of laughs,'' Shultz
said.
   About 250 people were invited, including diplomats and members
of Congress.

<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the crew pulling damaged fuel
and debris from the Three Mile Island Unit 2 nuclear plant fell
part way into radioactive water covering the reactor, a spokesman
says.
   The 30-year-old worker, whose name was not given, caught
himself, and only his legs below the knees went into the water
Monday, said Doug Bedell, spokesman for GPU Nuclear Corp., which
manages the plant.
   The worker, who was wearing protective clothing, suffered only
minor bruises and received a radiation exposure to the skin of less
than several hundred millirems, Bedell said. The federal limit for
skin exposure to a workers' legs is 18,250 millirems every three
months.
   The worker was decontaminated at the plant, and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission was notified, Bedell said.
   It was the first time someone fell into the reactor pool since
the cleanup began 2{ years ago, he said.
   Unit 2 was damaged in 1979 in the nation's worst commercial
nuclear accident, when some of the fuel melted after a loss of
reactor coolant. Two-thirds of the damaged fuel has been removed.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Dukakis Fund to Rebuild America Is Inadequate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson was turning his
attention today to foreign affairs, a day after touting a new
budget plan and criticizing the economic policies of his rival,
Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   Jackson on Monday proposed a five-year, $344 billion package of
new health, education and housing programs financed by raising
taxes on corporations and the rich and a freeze on military
spending.
   Jackson released his 18-page spending plan _ the most detailed
budget proposal by any of the presidential candidates remaining in
the race _ at a news conference Monday at the state Capitol in
Sacramento. He was in California campaigning in advance of the June
7 primary.
   Also Monday, Jackson toured a Head Start center in a low-income
neighborhood near the California Capitol and faced a hostile crowd
of nuclear plant workers at a rally planned by anti-nuclear
activists outside of Sacramento's Rancho Seco nuclear plant.
   The Democratic presidential candidate was playing up foreign
policy today, addressing the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles.
He also scheduled a stop at the South African consulate to
underline his anti-apartheid message.
   Jackson used his budget news conference to contrast his agenda
for the nation with both Dukakis and Vice President George Bush,
the Republican nominee-to-be.
   He said Bush would continue the policies of President Reagan and
Dukakis offers only timid adjustments.
   ``Reagan has cut investment in health care, housing, legal
services, day care, scholarships by more than $100 billion. Mr.
Dukakis rails against that as being wrong, but offers to offset it
by only $775 million,'' Jackson said. ``That is radically
conservative, away from the dreams and aspirations of most
Democrats.''
   Dukakis, campaigning in New Jersey Monday night, took exception
to that assessment.
   ``It does represent a fundamental change over what we've had the
past four years,'' the Massachusetts governor said of his own
economic plan, which he has outlined in more general terms than
Jackson's.
   Dukakis also suggested Jackson might be naive for trying to set
down spending figures so far in advance.
   ``There's no way you can prepare a budget today for 1989,'' he
said.
   At a rally outside the Rancho Seco nuclear power plant near
Sacramento, Jackson told plant workers nuclear power is ``a
dangerous job option.''
   A Sacramento-area voter referendum seeks to shut down the plant.
   ``We have oil reserves. We have coal reserves. We have solar. We
have hydroelectric,'' Jackson said as he discussed the dangers of
nuclear power.
   The crowd of about 250, in which plant workers appeared to
outnumber Jackson supporters by about 3-1, broke out in boos at
that point.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arab member of Israel's parliament on
Monday urged American Jews to join American Arabs in opposing the
Israeli government's hostile policy toward the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   ``The Arab community in the (United) States and the Jewish
community in the states have a common interest as peace lovers, and
I'm waiting for the Jewish community here to play a positive role
convincing the Israeli government to adopt a more reasonable policy
toward the Palestine issue,'' said Abdel-Wahab Darawshe.
   Darawshe, a Knesset member who recently quit the Israeli Labor
Party to found a new Arab party in Israel, made the statement at
the 16th convention of the National Association of Arab-Americans.
   The association, which seeks a stronger political voice for
Americans of Arab ancestry, used ``campaigning for peace'' as the
theme of the annual convention. Speakers condemned Israeli measures
against Palestinian demonstrations in the occupied territories
during the past half year and urged the United States and Israel to
accept the PL0 as the authentic Palestinian representative in peace
talks.
   ``The Palestinian people have decided who is their
representative and any attempt to find alternatives is just wasting
time and bringing causes for more bloodshed,'' Darawshe said. He
also said the PLO should formally proclaim a Palestinian government
in exile.
   Israel and the United States refuse to deal with the PLO unless
it acknowledges Israel's right to exist.
   Invitations to Monday's session said an unnamed, prominent
Israeli official would appear, and an empty chair at the head table
symbolized the official's absence.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the Arab newspaper Al-Fajr in
Jerusalem, told the gathering ``It is high time to have the
international community and the United States bring the adversaries
to the negotiating table,'' because ``the alternative is disaster
to the whole area ... with national suicide for all parties in the
region, Israelis, Palestinians, Arabs.
   ``The obstacle to peace is the attitude of the present coalition
government of Israel,'' he said.
   In another development, 36 members of Congress, mostly
Democrats, sent Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir a letter
urging him to reconsider the pending deportation of Mubarak Awad, a
naturalized U.S. citizen of Palestinian birth who founded the
Palestinian Center for the Study of Nonviolence.
   ``The recent violence in the occupied territories highlights the
urgent need to'' renounce violence and ``now, more than ever, the
philosophy espoused by Mr. Awad will be necessary if Israel is to
enjoy a more secure and peaceful future,'' said the letter,
circulated by the association of Arab-Americans.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Little Calvin Lorick, who weighed less than 2
pounds when he was born nearly two years ago, has gone home from
the hospital for the first time in his life.
   Calvin was born June 25, 1986, at St. Mary's Health Center, two
months premature and weighing only 1 pound, 11 ounces. He was
transferred soon after to Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital.
   On Monday, Calvin, weighing 17 pounds, 10 ounces, left for home.
His nurses crowded into his room and threw a going-away party. They
took turns snuggling with him and gave him tastes of a chocolate
cake that bore the message, ``Calvin, We Will Miss You.''
   The youngster's parents, Ella Pritchard and Calvin Lorick of St.
Louis, said they were overjoyed and apprehensive to be taking their
son home at last.
   ``We have been looking forward to this day for quite some
time,'' said Pritchard, 26.
   ``I'm a little scared,'' said Lorick, 33. ``This is an
experience that we have not had before. I feel that between the
good Lord and myself, we are going to pull it through.''
   Dr. Suzanne Toce, a neonatologist at Cardinal Glennon, said
Calvin had developed a severe chronic lung disease and had required
long-term treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit and the
special care nursery.
   He will still require oxygen during the day and a ventilator at
night, but will be weaned from both.
   ``I just thank God for his coming as far as he has,'' Pritchard
said. ``This is a whole new start for him now.''
   Calvin has two brothers and two sisters who visited him
regularly in the hospital, which became a home away from home for
the family.
   Lorick, who works as a lift truck operator, said that he did not
know how much Calvin's medical care had cost but that the total was
probably ``in the millions.'' Pritchard said expenses had been
covered by insurance.

<HEAD>US Refines Zero Tolerance Policy After Several Seized Yachts
Returned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Coast Guard and Customs Service,
intent on hanging onto yachts they seize under the new
``zero-tolerance'' anti-drug policy, have revised their procedures,
officials say.
   ``This is not really a change in the policy on zero-tolerance,''
Coast Guard spokesman Capt. Randall Peterson said Monday night.
``These are just some refinements in how we enforce the law.''
   Under the new guidelines, government officials no longer will
seize vessels on the high seas _ beyond the 12-mile U.S.
territorial limit _ simply because they carry small amounts of
illegal drugs, said Peterson and Customs spokesman Dennis Murphy.
   Now the boats will be seized only if there is evidence they are
being used to transport drugs into the United States, they said.
   The new guidelines were issued in the wake of highly publicized
episodes in which expensive yachts were seized and then returned to
their owners.
   Among such vessels was the Atlantis II, owned by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution of Massachusetts, which explored the
wreck of the Titanic. Officials in San Diego seized the vessel when
a crewman was found with a small amount of marijuana.
   In Florida, the Coast Guard has boarded and confiscated the $2.5
million Ark Royal, as well as the Monkey Business _ the Bahamas
vacation yacht used by former presidential candidate Gary Hart,
model Donna Rice and their friends. Both yachts carried only minute
amounts of drugs.
   ``There were a couple of cases last week that raised some
questions, so we sat down with the Coast Guard and Transportation
so everybody was armed with as much information as possible,''
Murphy said. ``In some of the cases we ran into, we didn't have
enough evidence or a substantial enough case to take it to
forfeiture.''
   Peterson said: ``The way the law is written, possession of a
controlled substance such as marijuana inside the 12-mile limit is
against the law. However, if you're outside the 12-mile limit,
there has to be evidence that there's intent to import or export.''
   The amount of the controlled substance doesn't matter, he said.
   ``What matters is where they've been, where they say they're
going, what's written on the charts indicating where they're going
... a wide variety of things,'' Peterson said.
   If Customs or Coast Guard officers see a small amount of illegal
drugs in plain sight on a vessel on the high seas, that will be
enough evidence to bring the boat in for further search, but ``It
isn't the same as seizure,'' Murphy said.
   A spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union, which said
last week that it was conducting a review of the zero-tolerance
policy, dismissed the changes as simply a reaction to criticism of
the seizures.
   ``What this says to me is they have been burned by their own
publicity,'' national ACLU spokeswoman Colleen O'Connor said in a
telephone interview from New York. ``They have come to realize the
criticism of them is valid and they can't withstand it. ...
   ``The idea of seizing million-dollar yachts for small quantities
of marijuana had nothing to do with what the administration
intended for its war on crime,'' O'Connor said.
   Murphy defended the zero-tolerance policy, saying that since it
went into effect March 21, it has resulted in the arrests of 1,000
people coming over the border with illegal drugs.
   ``That's what zero-tolerance is about,'' he said. ``It's a
policy to arrest and punish users as well as traffickers ... and
that is working.''
   The new guidelines were issued to Customs officers last Friday,
and to the Coast Guard officers on Saturday, the officials said.

   A dozen paintings believed obtained by
Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos will be brought to the United States
from France in an effort to recover some of the at least $3.5
billion in wealth the couple removed from the Philippines,
U.S.-based Philippine investigators said today.
   The 16th and 17th century paintings confiscated from Saudi
Arabian businessman Adnan Kashoggi are to be used in a grand jury
investigation of Marcos in New York, according to Severina Rivera,
in charge of the U.S. office of the Philippine Commission on Good
Government.
   Some of the paintings expected to be turned over to the Justice
Department this week had been hanging in the Philippine
presidential palace ballroom in Manila before Marcos was deposed in
February 1986, the commission said.
   Among the paintings are works by El Greco, Peter Paul Rubens,
Frans Hals, and several other artists.
   The commission says it has recovered $204 million in cash, real
estate, stocks, paintings and antiques, with another $2.11 billion
contested in litigation in the Philippines, the United States and
Switzerland.
   Estimates of wealth taken out of the country by Marcos, who
ruled for 20 years, and by his family members and associates have
ranged as high as $10 billion. But the commission formed to pursue
his wealth puts the value of Marcos assets currently frozen or
actively pursued at $3.5 billion.
   In a news release from the commission's Washington office,
commission Chairman Ramon A. Diaz is quoted as saying that a
worldwide inventory of paintings claimed by the Philippines is
being put together, but it is believed the Marcoses purchased more
than 100 valuable masterpieces from around the world.
   The Philippines claims that after the Marcoses were exiled in
Hawaii, his agents and Kashoggi carted away 25 paintings from New
York properties owned by the Marcoses. The action allegedly came
after a California federal judge ordered that none of the Marcoses'
property could be ``transferred, encumbered or conveyed'' until the
court decides who it belongs to _ Marcos or the government of his
successor, President Corazon Aquino.
   Thirteen of the paintings were previously returned to the United
States after Kashoggi turned them over to French authorities. But a
company called Interconsult Eastern Management claimed it had
purchased the remaining 12 art works from Kashoggi for $3.2 million.
   The Philippine government alleged the sale was invalid because
Kashoggi never actually owned the paintings, but was only acting as
a front for Marcos. A Paris court last Friday agreed the paintings
could be returned to the United States.
   The Philippine government hopes eventually to sell the
paintings, using the proceeds for land-reform programs, officials
have said.

taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   COUNSEL
   
   The court gave trial judges broad power to deny criminal
defendants the lawyer of their choice if a possible conflict of
interest exists.
   The court also ruled that judges may veto a defendant's choice
of lawyers even when the defendant is willing to waive the right to
conflict-free legal help.
   The case is Wheat vs. U.S., 87-4.
   
   CHILD PORN
   
   The court agreed to consider reinstating a Massachusetts
child-pornography law a state court said could be used to prosecute
parents who photograph their naked, infant children on the beach.

interferes with a form of expression.
   The case is Massachusetts vs. Oakes, 87-1651.
   
   SAFETY
   
   The court gave states some power to enforce safety codes at
federal nuclear production facilities for hazards unrelated to
radiation.
   The justices, in a 6-2 ruling, said a worker injured falling
from a scaffold at a nuclear plant in Ohio is entitled to seek a
``bonus'' compensation award.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said federal
law does not prohibit states from indirectly enforcing safety
regulations at federal facilities by awarding supplemental workers'
compensation for code violations.
   The case is Goodyear Atomic vs. Miller, 86-1172.
   
   ANNUITIES
   
   The court let stand a ruling that millions of so-called fixed
annuities are subject to federal securities law.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that fixed
annuities paying fluctuating interest rates may be regulated the
same as stocks and bonds.
   The case is VALIC vs. Otto, 87-600.
   
   LIBEL AWARD
   
   The court let stand a $100,000 libel award won against a
Richmond, Va., newspaper and one of its reporters by a high school
teacher in that city.

Times-Dispatch's challenge of the judgment won by Vernelle
Lipscomb, a longtime English teacher in Richmond's public schools.
   The case is Richmond Newspapers Inc. vs. Lipscomb, 87-1636.
   
   PHOTOS MERGER
   
   The court refused to unravel a merger between Eastman Kodak Co.
and Fuqua Industries that created the nation's largest wholesale
photofinishing operation.

   Billy Carter, brother of former President
Carter, is undergoing an experimental treatment at the National
Cancer Institute beginning today that he hopes will cure his
pancreatic cancer.
   Dr. Steven Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the federally run
institute said Carter would be in the hospital about three weeks.
   ``He will be receiving a very experimental treatment,'' he said.
Rosenberg was one of President Reagan's physicians when he received
colon cancer surgery in 1985.
   Carter, 51, will be treated with the new protein drug
interleukin-2.
   Carter, who lost both parents and a sister to cancer, said he
hopes the treatment will help scientists find a way to save his six
children if they get the disease, as well as thousands of others.
   ``They seemed pretty excited about getting hold of me,'' Carter
said. ``They've only had one pancreas patient to try their drug on
up there and when they found I've got perfect health _ well, except
for my cancer and my bum knees _ they said, `Come on.'''
   Carter has been undergoing an experimental platinum-based
chemotherapy treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta
since the cancer was discovered last fall.

   Thousands of people were evacuated Monday
after authorities feared formation of deadly gas from chemicals
including cyanide stored at a plating company that was destroyed by
fire.
   Up to 11,000 residents, elementary school pupils and workers in
the Lincoln Heights section northeast of downtown were evacuated by
Monday evening. Hundreds sought shelter at Dodger Stadium.
   No injuries were reported and no chemical cloud had formed,
officials said.
   The Builders Hardware Finishers Inc. building was destroyed by a
predawn fire that was extinguished by 5 a.m., said fire spokesman
Jim Williamson.
   The precautionary evacuation was ordered at 11:30 a.m., after
hazardous materials crews determined that 26,000 gallons of
chemicals housed in the plating company were unstable and could
pose a health hazard, Williamson said.
   One of the stored chemicals was cyanide and that could combine
with other chemicals to create a deadly gas similar to that used in
the gas chamber at San Quentin, said fire Inspector Ed Reed.
   At least 11,000 people had been evacuated by Monday evening,
said Police Sgt. Mario Mojarro. But Fire Department spokesman Greg
Acevedo said the number was closer 3,800. The residents were not
expected to be allowed back into their homes until midnight at the
earliest, authorities said.
   ``This thing may go on all night,'' police Officer Henry
Covarrubias said late Monday.
   The Red Cross set up an evacuation center with overnight
accommodations under the centerfield bleachers of nearby Dodger
Stadium, where about 200 people had arrived by 10 p.m.
   ``I'm not going to be able to sleep, because I haven't seen my
husband, and my husband doesn't know where I am,'' said Maria Cruz,
at Dodger Stadium with her small son.
   A private company was called in to remove the chemicals,
Williamson said. Firefighters stood by while the chemicals were
removed from the building.
   The fire caused an estimated $340,000 damage to the building but
the cause of the blaze remained under investigation, Williamson
said.

<HEAD>Soviet Army in Afghanistan Suffers Friction, Drug Use, Low Morale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan suffer
from ethnic friction, high drug use, and low morale that has led to
suicides and the murder of officers by their troops, according to a
private U.S. study.
   The problems appear to be related to the nature of the Soviet
role in Afghanistan and do not indicate similar problems in the
whole Soviet military, said the RAND Corp. study released Monday.
   The study, conducted for the U.S. Army before the start of the
Soviet withdrawal, found that ``the war in Afghanistan has shown
that ethnic cleavages in the Soviet armed forces continue to be
deep,'' particularly between Moslems and Russians and other Slavs.
   The author, Alex Alexiev, said, however, the problems ``would
not be likely to play much of a role in other war scenarios,'' such
as a conflict between the Warsaw Pact and NATO.
   Alexiev said he interviewed 35 former Soviet servicemen who
served in Afghanistan and examined more than 300 articles published
in the Soviet press since Soviet troops entered that nation in 1979.
   The study estimated the number of Soviet troops in Afghanistan
at 118,000 to 150,000, higher than the standard Western figure of
115,000, and said they were closely supported by 30,000 to 50,000
combat and support troops just across the Amu Darya River in the
Soviet Union.
   The study said the morale problems among the occupation troops
appeared to stem from three main sources: the high number of
criminal convicts among draftees, friction between Moslems and
Slavs, and brutality of officers and older enlisted men toward new
recruits. These problems lead to violence between officers and
enlisted men, as well as suicide.
   Many Soviet officers volunteered to serve in Afghanistan because
it meant higher pay, swifter promotion, and such benefits as
guaranteed entrance into prestigious military academies, the report
found.
   Many draftees, it said, volunteered for Afghanistan in lieu of
prison.
   One former soldier said that in Afghanistan, Soviet ``officers
who come are interested only in money. For those who serve in
Afghanistan, two years are equivalent to six in the Soviet Union.
There you have to wait six years for a promotion _ here only two
but with three times the salary. So only greedy people volunteer
for Afghanistan.''
   The problem of ``fragging,'' or the murder of officers, often
with fragmentation grenades, stems from the cruelty often shown
toward new enlisted men. Half of the former Soviet soldiers
interviewed by RAND said they had defected because of the brutality.
   Many of the soldiers in the occupation forces, as distinct from
the elite units, are of the same ethnic background as the Afghans,
such as Tajiks, Turkomen, or Uzbeks, and often engaged in brawls
with the Russians.
   Before the Soviets entered Afghanistan, the report said, ``drug
abuse in the Soviet army was considered by most analysts to be
negligible ... Today ... there is good reason to believe that a
majority, perhaps even a substantial majority, of Soviet forces (in
Afghanistan) use drugs on a fairly regular basis.''

<HEAD>Boston Banker To Be Federal Reserve Board Nominee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan Administration says it wants to put
Boston banking executive John P. LaWare on the Federal Reserve's
board of governors.
   LaWare, whose nomination was announced Monday, would fill a
14-year seat that has been empty since December 1986, when Henry
Wallich resigned.
   LaWare, a 60-year-old Democrat, has been chairman and director
of Shawmut National Corp. and Shawmut Bank in Boston since 1978.
   He was the latest in series of potential candidates for the job.
Others considered at one time or another for the post were Leif
Olsen, the former chief economist at Citibank, and William
Eagleson, retired chairman of Mellon Bank Corp. of Pittsburgh.
   Many of the potential candidates ran afoul of a requirement that
no two members of the seven-member board can reside in the same Fed
district.
   LaWare resides in Brookline, Mass., in the Boston Federal
Reserve district, which does not have a representative on the board.
   That LaWare is a Democrat is expected to boost his chances of
winning approval. There had been speculation the
Democratic-controlled Senate might block any nominee to allow the
next president to fill the spot.
   But both Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin, the chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, and Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the ranking
Republican, have indicated their willingness to consider a Reagan
nomination if it were made quickly.
   LaWare's appointment would mean a board of all Reagan nominees.
It was not expected that his arrival would alter the general
direction of Fed policy under Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was
appointed by Reagan a year ago to succeed Paul Volcker.
   LaWare came to Shawmut as president in 1978 from Chemical Bank,
which he joined in 1953. He was named chairman and chief executive
of Shawmut in 1980.
   He was graduated from Harvard University in 1950 and received a
master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951.

<HEAD>Two Refuse To Sign Report Decrying Minority Plight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of a commission on America's
minorities refused to sign a final report which says the nation is
slipping in efforts to achieve equality for blacks, Hispanics and
Indians.
   The report, ``One-Third of a Nation'' by the Commission on
Minority Participation, proposes a 20-year effort to close the gap
between the races in income, education and other areas.
   The group of civic, academic and political leaders including
former Presidents Ford and Carter said America has not only ``lost
the momentum of earlier minority progress'' but has suffered
reversals in the drive for full equality.
   Panel members Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft and former Secretary
of State William Rogers refused to sign the final report.
   Ashcroft indicated he found it too negative. Rogers declined to
discuss his reasons, but he was said to have felt the report was
exaggerated.
   Ashcroft, a Republican and one of four governors on the
40-member commission, thought the report's ``generalizations about
setbacks in progress are overly broad and counterproductive,''
according to his office.
   Two education groups, The American Council on Education and the
Education Commission of the States, established the commission last
fall. Ashcroft chairs the Education Commission of the States.
   Among the statistics cited in the report:
   _In 1986, 31 percent of blacks and 27 percent of Hispanics were
living in poverty, nearly three times the rate for whites.
   _Unemployment in April was 12.2 percent for blacks, 9.3 percent
for Hispanics and 4.6 percent for whites.
   _Twenty percent of whites age 25 or older have completed
college, compared with 11 percent of blacks and just 8.4 percent of
Hispanics.
   The bipartisan panel refrained from directly criticizing the
Reagan administration or anyone else, but it said leaders from the
White House to Congress to state capitals must ``lend their full
energies to the cause'' of minority advancement.
   The panel included business executives, college presidents,
three former secretaries of state (Edmund Muskie, Cyrus Vance and
Rogers); Coretta Scott King, former Education Secretary T.H. Bell,
Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, and Ted Koppel of ABC
News.

   Four people remained hospitalized today
after a chemical explosion in a computer parts manufacturing plant
sprayed caustic materials throughout the plant, officials said.
   Sixteen people were injured in the blast Monday morning at the
Automata Inc. plant, authorities said.
   By Monday night, two remained in critical condition, two in
serious condition, said Bill Goldfeder, director of the Loudoun
County Fire and Rescue Department. The others injured in the
explosion at the Automata, Inc. computer parts factory were treated
at local hospitals and released, he said.
   The blast spewed a chemical containing sulfuric acid and
hydrochloric acid into the plant.
   ``We had people get doused and drenched with the chemical when
it exploded,'' said fire chief Jim Kiser, head of the department's
emergency response team. Kiser said people continued to breathe
chemical fumes as they were being treated.
   The explosion happened in the processing room of the plant
shortly before 7 a.m. EDT, when a machine used in making electronic
circuit boards for computers blew up, authorities said.
   Goldfeder said investigators had ruled out foul play as the
cause. The incident will probably be ruled an industrial accident
``due to human error or equipment failure,'' he said.
   Workers, who were apparently changing the chemical mixture
that's used to clean copper parts, suffered a variety of injuries.
   ``Our units found several people outside suffering from
everything from respiratory to shrapnel-type injuries from the
explosions, metal parts and what have you,'' Goldfeder said.
   In addition to plant employees, the victims included three
firefighters and a Loudoun County Sheriff's Department deputy.
   ``Hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid were involved,'' said
Goldfeder. ``They're bad. They both cause injuries to the skin as
well as respiratory problems.''
   The blast created no toxic cloud and presented no danger to the
environment or to people living near the plant, authorities said.
   The plant employs about 125 people.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega extended for
30 days a cease-fire to give his leftist Sandinista government and
the rebels more time to arrange a permanent truce.
   However, the two sides remained deadlocked on Monday over the
site of their next round of peace talks.
   Ortega insisted that the three days of negotiations scheduled to
begin on Wendesday be held in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua.
   In a statement issued in Miami, the rebels said they were
planning to meet in Sapoa, a small Nicaraguan village on the Costa
Rican border.
   Both sides had agreed in March to a 60-day truce that would have
expired May 30. The extension means the temporary truce ends June
30.
   Ortega said he decided to stretch the cease-fire ``in the
interest of allowing negotiations to continue on a definite truce.
We hope the counterrevolutionary directorate contributes to this
effort and acts in accordance with the Nicaraguan people's wishes
for peace.''
   The Contras, as the rebels are known, have resisted holding
another round of negotiations in Managua.
   They complained that during two previous sessions, the
government restricted them to a hotel near the airport on the
outskirts of Managua and refused to let them move freely in the
capital and meet with domestic political opposition groups.
   The five directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contras'
Miami-based umbrella organization, said in their statement on
Monday that Defense Minister Humberto Ortega had proposed Sapoa and
San Juan del Sur as meeting sites. The defense minister is
President Ortega's brother and chief of the government delegation
negotiating with the Contras.
   President Ortega said Contra delegates would be allowed to meet
in Managua with representatives of the Democratic Coordinate, the
principal opposition group; the opposition newspaper La Prensa; and
Roman Catholic bishops.
   In another development, a source at the Interior Ministry said
American Gary Moore, 38, was expelled from Nicaragua after he
entered a restricted military zone with fake identification
documents.
   In Washington, the State Department described Moore as a
free-lance journalist.
   The Interior Department source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Moore was working for a conservative American group
and was arrested May 18 at Laguna de Perlas, a military zone on the
Caribbean coast. He was deported to neighboring Costa Rica either
late Friday or Saturday.
   The source said Moore ``entered military bases illegally. He
also falsified an accreditation from the presidency's International
Press Center.''
   According to the source, Moore told authorities that he worked
for the National Forum Foundation, a conservative group based in
Washington, D.C., which cooperates with the Nicaraguan Resistance.
   In an interview on Sunday in San Jose, Costa Rica, Moore told
The Associated Press that he was 38 years old, was from Tupelo,
Miss., and had worked for The Atlanta Constitution and The Miami
Herald newspapers. Moore confirmed that he was working for the
National Forum Foundation.
   He said he was working on a documentary on alleged human rights
abuses by the Sandinista government when arrested.
   ``They confiscated all my material,'' including videotapes,
notes and photographs, Moore said.

   The FBI kept a top-secret file on a
youngster who wrote 169 countries requesting information for a
homemade encyclopedia and received at least 50 pieces of mail that
had been tampered with, a federal lawsuit says.
   Todd Patterson, now 17, said he wants to see his complete FBI
file, and wants it expunged.
   His lawsuit, filed Monday, also seeks a stop to mail tampering
and surveillance, and unspecified damages for violation of his
privacy.
   ``I feel that with a black spot on my record, it works against
me getting a job,'' he says. ``They invaded my privacy, but I can
understand why if there's a potential threat.''
   FBI spokesman James Knights in Newark said he cannot comment on
the suit, ``same as in any investigation. We're not going to
confirm or deny.''
   Most of the tampered mail came from the Soviet Union, according
to the suit. In 1984, a year after he began the encyclopedia
project as a sixth-grader, an FBI agent visited his North Haledon
home and later questioned him on the telephone, the suit said.
   The suit also charges that Patterson's First Amendment rights
were violated on the grounds that he was being penalized for
pursuing his education and expressing himself.
   Eric Neisser, of the American Civil Liberties Union in New
Jersey, says the case is the nation's first seeking the right to
wipe out FBI files on First Amendment grounds.
   A page from Patterson's FBI file, obtained under the federal
Freedom of Information Act and provided by his lawyer, reads:
``This communication is classified `Secret' in its entirety.''
   It continues:
   ``TODD is in the seventh grade at the Most Blessed Sacrament
School in Franklin Lakes.
   ``Newark indices as well as local criminal checks negative on
subject.
   ``In view of the above, Newark contemplates no further
investigation in this matter.''
   The papers also describe Patterson's encyclopedia project, which
the youth said is unfinished.
   The Postal Service told him it had no explanation for the
damaged mail, which included torn booklets, empty envelopes,
retaped letters and even an opened package containing a letter from
Sweden addressed to someone in Wayne whom the youth didn't know.
   The suit says that when Patterson's father, Edgar, first made a
Freedom of Information request in October, he was refused. After an
appeal, the FBI released six pages, much of them blacked out and
half duplicated.
   The rest was classified, according to a Justice Department
official.
   ``He doesn't want them to have a file in the FBI in their
subservice files,'' said ACLU attorney Frank Askin, who is
representing Patterson.
   ``It's not to deface the FBI,'' Patterson said of the suit.
Patterson said he hopes to join the U.S. foreign service some day
and his main concern is the effect of the file on that goal.
   Patterson also said he is considering enrolling at the State
University of New York at Plattsburgh, where he would need a
security clearance for their government program internship with the
Canadian government.
   Patterson said he holds no grudge against the FBI.
   ``It's good they looked into it,'' he said of the investigation
into his foreign correspondence, ``but at a certain point it's got
to stop.''

<TEXT>
   The nation's main opposition party
today blamed U.S. policies and the South Korean government's
``humiliating subservience'' to the United States for a wave of
student riots.
   The Party for Peace and Democracy, led by former presidential
candidate Kim Dae-jung, said the protests were caused in part by
attempts to subordinate Korean policy to U.S. interests.
   The party also called on protesters to halt attacks on U.S.
diplomatic offices and said it did not endorse protesters' calls
for the removal of U.S. troops from South Korea.
   But the statement it released today was the party's harshest
criticism of the United States in recent months.
   ``Although we understand the feelings of the students, we
strongly ask them not to use violence under any circumstances,''
the statement said.
   Radical students have made three attacks on U.S. diplomatic
posts in Seoul and the southern city of Kwangju since Thursday. At
least five police officers and two students have been hurt in the
attacks, but no U.S. personnel have been injured.
   Protesters attacked the U.S. Information Service center in
Kwangju with firebombs late Monday. Students hurling bombs scaled
the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on Friday after an attack on
the Seoul U.S. Information Service office the day before.
   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said the nation was quiet
today after clashes Monday in Kwangju, 165 miles south of Seoul.
   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae promised action after the governing
Democratic Justice Party called today for tighter security to
protect U.S. diplomatic facilities and its own offices.
   The Party for Peace and Democracy urged the government and the
United States to study why students were protesting and take steps
to end repressive rule and other unpopular policies.
   The protests, it said, were caused by ``U.S. policies that
emphasize its own national interests and the (South Korean)
government's humiliating subservience toward the U.S.''
   Thousands of radical students and dissidents battled riot police
with firebombs and rocks in Seoul and other cities during the past
week in the worst political unrest since nationwide riots in the
summer of 1987.
   Radical groups have called for the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo and the removal of 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea
under a mutual defense pact.
   National police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that students who attacked the U.S. Information center in
Kwangju planned to seize the building to force the U.S. ambassador
to hold a public debate in the city on the American role in a 1980
uprising.
   The recent riots erupted around the May 18 anniversary of the
anti-government revolt. At least 191 people were killed when army
forces suppressed the uprising, and radicals claim the United
States was behind the suppression.
   U.S. officials have consistently denied the U.S. government had
anything to do with the Kwangju revolt. The United States has
tended to push quietly for democratic reform in South Korea over
the years.

   Sen. John Ewing put new meaning into the
words ``legislative battle'' when he bobbed and weaved through the
Statehouse wearing a bathrobe, sneakers, a towel around his neck
and red boxing gloves.
   The 69-year-old Republican, weighing in at 150 pounds, was
making light of a near-fight he had last week with Assemblyman
Anthony `Doc' Villane Jr., the 58-year-old chairman of the Assembly
appropriations committee.
   ``I want you to know that I've been staying in form at Mike
Tyson's gym,'' Ewing said Monday as he displayed some fancy
footwork to reporters. ``Got to keep moving all the time.''
   Ewing went into the Senate gallery and then took a quick trip to
the hallway outside the Assembly's chambers.
   Ewing and fellow Republican Villane, a dentist, had a heated
backroom argument last week that nearly erupted into fisticuffs.
The two ultimately were separated by aides and other lawmakers.
   The dispute flared after both had agreed to a compromise on a
bill to fight illegal drug use. Ewing became angry because Villane
would not let him testify about it before the appropriations
committee.
   Ewing's staff distributed a poster touting the ``long awaited
rematch'' for the ``World's Appropriations Championship'' between
``Mad Jack From Peapack'' Ewing and Doc ``No Novocaine'' Villane.
   When told of Ewing's antics Monday, Villane said with a smile:
``I didn't know I hurt him that bad.''

   Maryland has become the first state to ban
the sale of inexpensive handguns, including ``Saturday Night
Specials,'' but voters probably will have the final say on whether
the law actually goes into effect.
   With 200 police officers from five states present, Gov. William
Donald Schaefer on Monday signed the law forbidding manufacture and
sale of the weapons.
   ``This is the first time a legislature has stood up and said,
`These guns are wrong,''' said Schaefer.
   Well before the ceremony, opponents were gathering signatures to
hold a referendum on the law in November's general election.
   ``I'm confident that we are going to have the numbers that we
need for the ballot,'' said Fred Griisser, spokesman for the
Maryland Committee Against the Gun Ban. The committee must have the
signatures of 33,044 registered voters by June 30 to put the issue
on the ballot.
   Griisser was less confident about the outcome of a referendum,
saying gun groups face ``an uphill battle'' in explaining the law's
``true nature'' to voters.
   He said the statute bans all handguns, not just Saturday Night
Specials, and complained it does not require that any guns be
approved for sale by a review board established by the law.
   Gun control supporters said Maryland's law and the expected
referendum are crucial to efforts to ban Saturday Night Specials in
other states.
   ``It's important that we win. It's critical, and I'm sure we
will win,'' said Sarah Brady, who attended the signing ceremony
with her husband, White House press secretary James Brady.
   ``I'd like to see other states like dominoes fall into line,''
said Brady, who was wounded by a Saturday Night Special in John
Hinckley's 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan. Brady
has been in a wheelchair ever since.
   Mrs. Brady accused the law's opponents of spreading false
information that the bill would ban all handguns, and said it is
aimed only at Saturday Night Specials.
   The Bradys joined state leaders and 200 uniformed police
officers from Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and West
Virginia on the steps of the State House for the signing.
   Schaefer called the measure a step toward stopping ``the
senseless killing on our streets.''
   Saturday Night Specials have been used to kill 250,000 people
and wound 1{ million in the last 20 years, said Mrs. Brady, who
called the law ``a great step for public safety.''
   The law makes it illegal after Jan. 1, 1990, to sell or
manufacture a gun in Maryland unless it is on a list prepared by
the newly created nine-member review board. The law does not
mention Saturday Night Specials, but directs the board to exclude
easily concealed, inaccurate, unsafe and poorly made handguns.
   The law also allows the board to ban plastic guns that can be
slipped through metal detectors.
   Manufacturers can be fined up to $10,000 and dealers and gun
owners up to $2,500 per violation. Each time a gun is made or sold
constitutes a separate violation.
   Mrs. Brady, who has been campaigning for tougher gun laws since
her husband was shot, said Maryland's approach solves the difficult
problem of trying to define Saturday Night Specials by leaving the
decision to a review board.
   The board will consist of three civilians, the superintendent of
state police and one representative each of a state prosecutors
association, the Maryland Association of Chiefs of Police,
Marylanders Against Handgun Abuse, the National Rifle Association
and a Maryland gun manufacturer.

   David Schoenbrun, a World War II correspondent
recruited for CBS News by Edward R. Murrow and the first broadcast
journalist to report from Vietnam, has died at age 73.
   ``David Schoenbrun was one of broadcasting's true originals,''
said Howard Stringer, president of CBS News. ``His access to the
great newsmakers of Europe was extraordinary, and his understanding
of foreign affairs remarkable. He will be long remembered by
colleagues and audiences alike.''
   Schoenbrun, who had left CBS in the 1960s to become a full-time
lecturer and commentator, died Monday at Beth Israel Hospital after
suffering a heart attack, said Marty Appel, a spokesman for
WPIX-TV, for whom Schoenbrun had done free-lance work.
   ``This was not just another guy in the business,'' said CBS
anchor Dan Rather. ``He was one of the original Murrow men,
absolutely fantastic war reporting record. What he did, nobody did
it better.''
   Schoenbrun, who was one of the first commentators of Voice Of
America in the early 1940s, had gone to Europe in 1941 with the War
Information Office as an editor. He joined the Army in 1943 and
covered the invasion of southern France in 1944.
   Schoenbrun, a former high school French teacher, was introduced
to Murrow by Gen. Dwight Eisenhower in Algiers at the end of World
War II.
   Murrow hired Schoenbrun as Paris correspondent. He was Paris
bureau chief from 1947 until 1961, and thanks to his fluent French
became very close to President Charles De Gaulle.
   He was the only American correspondent inside the French
garrison at the historic 1954 battle of Dien Bien Phu won by North
Vietnam, and the first broadcast journalist to report from North
Vietnam.
   He wrote seven best-selling books, including ``Soldiers of the
Night,'' the story of the French resistance movement during World
War II; and ``America Inside Out: At Home And Abroad From Roosevelt
to Reagan.''
   He is survived by his wife.

   A Polish sailor who jumped ship in a bid
for political asylum has been released from jail after two months,
still facing possible deportation but flooded with offers of money
and shelter.
   ``It's wonderful, finally free,'' Andrzej Piotr Prajzner, 27,
said after paying bail and leaving the Snohomish County Jail on
Monday.
   Offers of aid, including donations to meet Prajzner's $1,500
bail, began arriving when news reports described his plight after
jumping ship in British Columbia on March 15 and being thrown in
jail by a U.S. immigration judge.
   ``It constantly amazes me how a Soviet seaman who jumps ship can
get asylum in four hours, and a Cuban bicyclist in Mexico denied
asylum there, was brought to Texas and given instant asylum. It's
quite a contrast. That's why so many people were outraged'' by
Prajzner's case, said Daniel P. Danilov, a lawyer who is
representing the sailor.
   An Immigration and Naturalization Service official said
Prajzner's case differs from the cases cited by Danilov because he
did not have permission to be in the United States when he
requested asylum at the U.S.-Canadian border at Blaine on March 23.
   ``This is routine, done whenever somebody sneaks over the
border,'' said Pamela Carrozza, INS deputy district director.
``Cases like this one fall under separate statutes than when
somebody is already in the United States legally and then requests
asylum.''
   Prajzner, who had been a cook aboard a fishing vessel, said he
had been hoping to come to the United States since he was a young
man.
   ``I cannot live under a Communist government because of the
repression,'' he wrote in his petition for asylum. ``I want to be a
free man in a free country.''
   If returned to Poland, he said, ``I would be imprisoned for
jumping ship and applying for asylum.''
   At his immigration hearing May 13, the State Department agreed,
supporting his plea and saying he had a ``well-grounded fear of
persecution'' if he were returned to Poland.
   Immigration Judge Daniel Kuhn denied asylum and ordered Prajzner
deported. He had no legal representation at the hearing, and was
held in jail until his story became known.
   Prajzner has since received offers totaling more than $3,000 to
pay his $1,500 bail, and 15 families, mostly from the Seattle area,
volunteered to take him in. Others have offered him jobs, Danilov
said.
   The Polish American Congress in Washington, D.C., also joined
the effort to win him asylum, Danilov said.
   Danilov said he filed an appeal on Prajzner's behalf Monday and
was waiting for a court date.
   Prajzner, speaking through an interpreter, said he was a little
nervous about the future and bemused by his sudden celebrity, but
happy about the prospect of staying in America and thankful for the
efforts of those who helped him.
   ``I didn't know what to expect in the United States,'' Prajzner
said. ``People have been so giving _ I didn't expect all this.''

<HEAD>Zoo Gets Green Light on Panda Exhibit _ For Now</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials have given the Toledo Zoo
the green light to open its giant panda exhibit today, but are
still asking the zoo to produce original export documents for the
animals by next week.
   Last week, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the zoo would
not be allowed to display the two pandas, on loan from China, until
the document issue was resolved. The zoo, which is scheduled to
open the panda exhibit today, was given 10 days to come up with the
documentation.
   However, FWS spokesman David Klinger said Monday that lawyers
for the zoo gave the service a copy of the Chinese export permit
over the weekend and appear to be making a good-faith effort to
deliver the original documents.
   ``We're not going to stand in the way of them opening their
exhibit this week,'' said Klinger.
   Klinger said the pandas were taken out of the wild in China
nearly two months after Dec. 6, 1983, the date pandas were put on
an international conservation group's endangered species list. That
means the animals do not qualify for an exemption under a 1975
convention signed by 95 countries, including China and the United
States, he said.

   Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould is one of 17

baby brokers in 12 states out of business.
   ``Try to help shut these places down,'' Whitehead-Gould, whose
precedent-setting ``Baby M'' story was the subject of a network

   Whitehead-Gould, whose effort to void her surrogating contract

   She was accompanied by other members of the National Coalition

   Coalition leader Jeremy Rifkin said the group on Monday sent
petitions to attorneys general in 12 states where surrogate brokers

   The federal government says the effects of
acid rain are being felt in small streams in the mid-Atlantic
states where surface waters had previously had not been proven
vulnerable.
   Four percent of the stream mileage sampled in 1985 and 1986 in
mid-Atlantic areas was acidic and showed chemical characteristics
that made it unlikely all the acidity could have come from natural
sources, an Environmental Protection Agency study concluded.
   The study, made available Monday, said the proportion reached 10
percent on forested ridges inland from coastal lowlands.
   ``The lack of plausible sources of neutral salts in these
streams makes it likely'' that their acidity is ``probably
associated with atmospheric acid deposition,'' said the study.
   Courtney Riordan, head of acid rain research for EPA, said the
new findings show there has been ``an expansion of the geographic
area'' known to be influenced by acid rain.

<HEAD>Good First Week Tally for `Willow'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Willow,'' producer George Lucas' $55 million
medieval fantasy, opened to mixed reviews but to moviegoers'
delight, finishing No. 1 at the nation's box offices.
   Released early to avoid competition from ``Crocodile Dundee II''
and ``Rambo III,'' ``Willow'' hauled in $8.3 million last weekend.
   The amount surpassed the opening weekend business of ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark'' ($8.26 million in June 1981) and ``Top Gun''
($8.19 million in May 1986), said MGM-UA chairman Lee Rich.
   ``We're thrilled with the film's performance and look forward to
a healthy summer run,'' Rich said.
   The previous weekend's top performer, ``Friday the 13th Part VII
_ The New Blood,'' took in $3.43 million to place second to
``Willow.''
   In third was ``Colors'' with $2.9 million, followed by
``Beetlejuice'' with $2.7 million and ``Shakedown'' in fifth with
$1.2 million.
   ``Willow'' has attracted attention because of its cost to make
during a two-year period. Also fantasy films, especially the
sword-and-sorcery realm, generally have trouble drawing a big
audience.
   In ``Willow,'' the main character lives in an imaginary village
of little people and finds a baby floating in the river, but it's a
special baby who will threaten the throne of the evil Queen
Bavmorda.
   ``Willow,'' which opened Friday at 1,024 theaters nationwide
with little enthusiasm from reviewers, is the latest effort from
Lucas, whose ``Star Wars'' and ``Indiana Jones'' films have grossed
$1 billion.
   Art Murphy, who monitors box office trends for Daily Variety,
noted that only five motion pictures in history have ever done $8
million-plus during May's traditional pre-Memorial Day holiday
movie slump.
   ``It is very difficult to gross $8 million and `Willow' is off
to an excellent start,'' Murphy said.
   Daily Variety termed the film ``a medieval mishmash'' but
predicted ``kids will probably love it.'' The Hollywood Reporter
praised the production values but complained the storyline ``never
really kicks into overdrive.''
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release, and estimated production costs when available.
   1. ``Willow,'' MGM-UA, $8.31 million, 1,024 screens, $8,106 per
screen, $8.3 million, one week, $55 million.
   2. ``Friday the 13th Part VII - The New Blood,'' Paramount,
$3.43 million, 1,796 screens, $1,912 per screen, $13.24 million,
two weeks, n-a.
   3. ``Colors,'' Orion, $2.94 million, 1,388 screens, $2,122 per
screen, $34.4 million, six weeks, $12 million.
   4. ``Beetlejuice,'' Warner Bros., $2.72 million, 1,546 screens,
$1,764 per screen, $58,8 million, eight weeks, $20 million.
   5. ``Shakedown,'' Universal, $1.22 million, 938 screens, $1,703
per screen, $8.12 million, three weeks, n-a.
   6. ``Moonstruck,'' MGM-UA, $1.17 million, 771 screens, $1,525
per screen, $73.97 million, 23 weeks, $17 million.
   7. ``Above The Law,'' Warner Bros., $1.14 million, 715 screens,
$1,604 per screen, $17.45 million, seven weeks, $14 million.
   8. ``Salsa,'' Cannon, $1.13 million, 757 screens, $1,510 per
screen, $6.79 million, three weeks, n-a.
   9. ``Biloxi Blues,'' Universal, $1.12 million, 876 screens,
$1,282 per screen, $39.3 million, nine weeks, $16 million.
   10. ``The Last Emperor,'' Columbia, $930,729, 792 screens,
$1,175 per screen, $40.29 million, 27 weeks, $25 million.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hindu family of six was shot to death
early today by Sikh extremists in the state of Punjab, the Press
Trust of India reported.
   The family was killed after volunteer guards in the village of
Dhariwal in Jalandhar District exchanged fire with six gunmen who
arrived on motorcycles, the news agency said. The village is 50
miles southeast of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in northern India.
   The victims were identified as Ram Murti, 25, his mother, wife,
brother, sister-in-law and nephew, the agency said. One of the
guards and a child were seriously injured, the news agency reported.
   Police said one other Hindu was reported killed by Sikh
militants overnight in Amritsar District.
   The latest slayings raised to at least 1,160 the number of
people killed by Sikh radicals in Punjab so far this year. In 1987,
1,030 people were killed.
   Hundreds of migrant workers, mainly Hindus from the northern
states of Bihar and Orissa, have been reported fleeing Punjab
following three attacks on migrant laborers' camps in recent days.
No exact figures were available on the number of migrants leaving
Punjab.
   The migrants traditionally have traveled to Punjab, India's
richest agricultural state, to help with planting and harvesting.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland in Punjab since 1982.
   Police and paramilitary forces continued today to surround the
Golden Temple at Amritsar, where a 10-day siege that ended last
week succeeded in driving militants from the shrine. The temple was
reopened to the public Monday.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million population but are a majority in
Punjab.

   A Republican fund raiser says a coalition

   ``More than $448,000 has been raised since May 11 in pledges and

<TEXT>
   A 19-year-old psychology student who has
born in Thailand but lives in southern California captured the 1988
Miss Universe crown today in a pageant dominated by Asian women.
   Porntip Nakhirunkanok, the reigning Miss Thailand, wiped away
tears of joy and joined her hands in a Thai sign of thanks after
she was named to succeed 1987 Miss Universe Cecilia Bolocco of
Chile.
   Miss Nakhirunkanok, a black-haired woman from Bangkok, will
receive more than $250,000 in cash and prizes, including a Maserati
convertible and a mink coat.
   Three of the other four finalists were from Asia, including
first runner-up Yunjung Chang of South Korea. Amanda Olivares of
Mexico, Mizuho Sakaguchi of Japan and Pauline Yeung of Hong Kong
were finalists in a field that began with 66 contestants.
   Miss USA, Courtney Gibbs of Fort Worth, Texas, was one of 10
semi-finalists.
   Taiwan authorities lifted a 23-year-old ban on beauty contests
in October to bring the 37th annual pageant to this island.
   Organizers estimated about 700 million people watched the event
beamed around the world from Linkou Stadium in suburban Taipei.
   The pageant began at 9 a.m. today (9 p.m. EDT Monday) so U.S.
viewers could watch the program during prime time.
   Miss Nakhirunkanok, who weighs 114 pounds and stands 5 feet 8
inches tall, said she moved to Los Angeles with her family 15 years
ago.
   When asked by host Alan Thicke how she had learned English she
replied: ``I think I owe it to Big Bird. I watched `Sesame Street'
a lot when I was little.''
   The new Miss Universe said she is a sophomore studying
psychology at Pasadena City College in Californa and that she
briefly attended UCLA. She also is involved in charity work for
youth in Thailand.
   Thailand won the Miss Universe title once before, in 1965 when
Apasra Hongsakula was chosen.
   Beauty pageants were banned in 1964 by Taiwan's leaders, who
viewed the competitions as an extravagance for a poor nation and
were dismayed by reports that a Miss China winner performed strip
dances in Las Vegas.
   The island has since emerged as one of Asia's most prosperous
countries. Authorities lifted the ban last year to clear the way
for a domestic airline to sponsor the Miss Universe pageant despite
lingering opposition from a few groups, including retired soldiers
who view beauty contests as an insult to mothers.
   But the telecast generally was seen in Taiwan as an opportunity
to present the island to a worldwide audience as the Republic of
China, the official name of Taiwan that is seldom used
internationally because most countries recognize the rival
communist Chinese government in Beijing. The televised program
repeatedly referred to Taiwan as the Republic of China.
   Missing from the program was long-time host Bob Barker, an
animal rights activist who resigned after last year's competition
in Singapore to protest the use of furs.

<BYLINE>By JACKIE HALLIFAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Documents that support the story of a pilot whose
testimony is key to U.S. drug charges against Panama's Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega may be missing, federal officials say.
   An investigation is under way to determine whether the documents
were lost somewhere between Panama's capital and Miami or never
existed, said Jack Hook, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration here.
   ``That's the big question,'' Hook said Monday night. ``That's
why we turned the investigation over to our internal affairs unit
out of Washington.''
   A Panamanian attorney working undercover for the DEA gave the
documents to agency officials in Panama City, and they were stored
in a safe in the U.S. Embassy in Panama's capital, NBC's ``Nightly
News'' reported Monday.
   A 12-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Miami
on Feb. 4 accused the Panamanian leader of accepting $4.6 million
in bribes from Colombia's violent Medellin drug cartel. A grand
jury in Tampa indicted Noriega the next day on three marijuana
importation counts.
   The post-indictment information reportedly contained in the
documents was not crucial to the case, said DEA spokesman Cornelius
Dougherty in Washington.
   ``At this point in time, it does not affect the indictment,'' he
said. ``Beyond that I can't go.''
   Hook said he was unsure how important the documents were but
that the person who provided them to the DEA described them as
relevant to the charges.
   ``His claim was that they would be beneficial in the General
Noriega case for the United States and, again, at this point we
don't know if that's true or not,'' Hook said.
   U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner confirmed that an investigation into
the documents was being conducted but said he couldn't comment on
the contents or significance of the documents.
   The documents reportedly include flight plans and financial
records that corroborate the testimony of drug pilot Floyd Carlton,
a key witness against Noriega.
   NBC quoted unidentified authorities as saying that U.S. drug and
intelligence agents in Panama City were suspects in the
disappearance of the documents.
   ``That's absolutely false,'' Dougherty told The Associated
Press. ``There's no information or indication in any information
that we've received that would support any such allegation.''
   The investigation, a matter of routine policy, ``is on the
informant and not on any DEA agent,'' Dougherty said.

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of kidnapping and
murdering a businessman by burying him alive in a coffin-like box
``took the American dream ... and turned it into an Edgar Allan Poe
nightmare,'' the prosecutor says.
   Assistant Attorney General Michael Ficaro is seeking the death
penalty for Daniel J. Edwards, 31, of Bourbonnais, who was
convicted Monday.
   The jury deliberated about an hour before finding Edwards guilty
in the Sept. 2 abduction of Stephen Small, who suffocated while
buried in a rural section of Kankakee County in northeast Illinois
before his family could pay the $1 million ransom.
   Small, 40, was a great-grandson of former Gov. Len Small and a
member of a family with major media holdings. He was vice president
of Mid America Media, which owned radio and cable television
stations before its sale in 1986.
   Edwards showed no emotion when it was announced he had been
convicted of three counts of murder and 10 counts of aggravated
kidnapping.
   The jury will reconvene Wednesday to determine whether he should
be sentenced to death.
   In his closing argument in the week-long trial, Ficaro said
Edwards knew the Kankakee businessman wouldn't survive the burial.
``I never saw anybody come out of a grave,'' Ficaro said.
   ``Take a good long look,'' he told jurors as he pointed to the
homemade plywood crate in which Small died. ``Danny Edwards' greed
for the big score drove those nails, dug that grave and buried
Stephen Small alive.
   ``All Danny boy had to do to cash in on that jackpot was put
Stephen Small .. in a box,'' said Ficaro, slamming his hand on the
crate. ``He took the American dream ... and turned it into an Edgar
Allan Poe nightmare.''
   Edwards was ``a man who made greed his god,'' and planned for
Small to die so he could not tell police what had happened, said
Assistant Attorney General Frank Nowicki.
   Defense attorney Sheldon Reagan argued that a faulty air supply
system caused Small's death. He pointed out that Small was buried
with candy bars, lights, and water, and had not been harmed.
   ``It's an accident but it's not an intentional murder,'' said
Reagan, who sugggested someone else abducted Small.
   ``You don't make a box by accident,'' countered Ficaro.
``Stephen Small didn't wander by and fall in.''
   The prosecution argued that the candy bars, lights and water _
along with the plastic pipe the kidnapper claimed was for air _
were used to lure Small into the box.
   Small was lured from his Victorian home after midnight Sept. 2.
His wife, Nancy, received ransom calls throughout the day but could
not understand her husband's tape-recorded instructions for
delivering the cash.
   Two days later, police found Small's body buried under 3 feet of
sand about 13 miles southeast of Kankakee.
   ``Danny Edwards needed Stephen Small to make those tape
recordings and ... get in that box without a fight,'' said Nowicki.
   He said Small clawed, scratched and struggled to get out of the
box as he used up the limited air supply, but probably died within
hours.
   Edwards' live-in girlfriend, Nancy D. Rish, 26, awaits trial on
kidnapping and murder charges.

   Rotarians and their families have converged
on the city in record numbers, and merchants are rolling out the
welcome mats for conventioneers who are spinning a bonanza for
business.
   By Monday, 16,037 Rotarians and their families had registered
for the 79th convention of Rotary International at the Civic
Center, making it the largest such convention in the city's
history. The Convention and Visitors Bureau estimates that they
will spend more than $7 million just for meals and lodging before
the five-day convention ends Wednesday.
   ``We've had a great day,'' Tricia Cuddy, manager of Cacharel, a
downtown French couture boutique, said Monday. ``We've had a lot of
activity, and out of eight purchases, three of them have been by
Rotarians.''
   At Convention Hall on Monday, Prince Bertil of Sweden praised
Rotary International as being ``kind and generous'' for devoting a
day of its convention to Sweden, and said the organization's
programs are important.
   ``Since the founding of this colony ... the history of American
and Swedish relations has been one of mutual frienship and
respect,'' Bertil said.
   The convention set aside Monday as Swedish Celebration Day in
observance of the 350th anniversary of the founding of a Swedish
colony in America.
   Bertil was joined by retired Swedish tennis champion Bjorn Borg
and Jan Carlzon, president and chief executive officer of
Scandinavian Airlines of Stockholm, Sweden.
   Bertil appeared as representative of his nephew, King Carl XVI
Gustaf, who served as patron of the service organization's
PolioPlus Campaign in Sweden. The PolioPlus Campaign is to raise
funds to purchase polio vaccines for children around the world.

<HEAD>Trial Opens In Sex Discrimination Case Against Harvard Business
School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Harvard Business School professor who
claims she was the victim of sex discrimination is being pressed to
identify specific acts of bias that allegedly stopped her from
becoming the school's fifth tenured woman.
   Barbara Bund Jackson, 44, said Monday in the first day of
testimony that several faculty members discriminated against her
during her 11 years of teaching at the 80-year-old school.
   Jackson, who resigned in 1984, is asking U.S. District Court
Judge Douglas P. Woodlock to reinstate her with tenure and award
$847,000 in lost income.
   She cited several incidents of alleged sex bias by several
faculty members, saying one professor threatened that if she didn't
change the title of a course he would not back her for tenure. The
same professor, she said, refused to help her with computer program
problems in one course.
   ``Maybe he simply didn't like you as an individual,'' Harvard
attorney Allan A. Ryan Jr., said of Professor Robert Schlaifer.
   ``I had been told the opposition was based on gender,'' Ms.
Jackson said. ``My reaction when I see someone acting childish is
to look for a reason. Through conversations with a number of
people, I was led to conclude it was bias.''
   But when Ryan asked whether she could link Schlaifer to her
tenure denials in 1981 and 1983, she said she had ``no information
one way or another.''
   ``To me bias is a spectrum and I don't know where to draw the
line in that spectrum,'' Ms. Jackson said.
   In her lawsuit, Ms. Jackson says she was held to higher
standards than male candidates during her tenure review. She said
the school destroyed documents requested by her attorney to support
her claim that less-qualified men than her received tenure from
1974 to 1984.
   Ms. Jackson also says Harvard has discriminated against women in
hiring and admissions and is guilty of institutional bias.
   Harvard maintains Ms. Jackson was denied tenure solely because
her academic work was substandard, and the tenure records were
unwittingly destroyed by someone outside the business school.
   The lawsuit also names the school's dean, John H. McArthur.
   Under cross-examination, Ms. Jackson testified that she
supported McArthur's appointment in 1980 and thanked him for
settling a dispute involving an on-campus recruiter who told
students his company would not post women to Europe.
   Ms. Jackson, now a private marketing consultant, began teaching
at Harvard as an assistant professor in 1973. She was promoted to
associate professor in 1977 and applied for tenure in 1981.
   After failing to win faculty support on the grounds that while
her teaching skills were up to par her scholarship was inadequate,
Ms. Jackson was given a three-year extension on her appointment.
She submitted new academic work for review, but in December 1983
was rebuffed again.
   Tenure decisions at Harvard are submitted to a faculty
subcommittee and to the faculty to gauge support for the professor.
The actual decision rests with the university president, who
receives a recommendation from the school's dean.
   Three of the business school's 90 tenured professors are women.
Four women have received tenure in the business school's history,
the first in 1961.
   Nationally, 72 percent of male faculty members have tenure
compared with 45 percent of females, according to a recent survey
of 1,055 two- and four-year institutions by the American
Association of University Professors

   A programmer deleted more than 160,000
files from his ex-employer's computer by infecting it with an
electronic ``virus,'' said authorities who are prosecuting him on
felony charges.
   Donald Gene Burleson, 39, faces a charge of ``harmful access to
a computer,'' and is free on a $3,000 bond pending his July 11
trial. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   An indictment accuses him of executing programs ``designed to
interfere with the normal use of the computer'' and of acts ``that
resulted in records being deleted.''
   Police described the electronic interference as a ``massive
deletion'' of more than 168,000 records of sales commissions for
employees.
   Burleson is thought to be the first person charged under the
state law that took effect Sept. 1, 1985, and prohibits computer
sabotage, said Davis McCown, chief of the Tarrant County district
attorney's economic crimes division.
   Three weeks after the law went into effect, USPA and IRA Co., a
Fort Worth-based national securities and brokerage concern, noticed
a problem with its computer system, investigators said.
   An investigation revealed that an intruder had used a ``backdoor
password'' at night to gain access to the computer and covered his
tracks by erasing computer logs that would have documented his
activity.
   Burleson, a computer security officer who had been fired two
days before the infection, was one of only a few of the 200 workers
in the home office to have the access and knowledge needed to
sabotage the system, officials said. A computer ``virus'' is a
program that can severely damage a system's regular software.
Viruses can be transmitted among systems through contaminated
software or from programs picked up from electronic bulletin boards.
   ``You can see it, but you can't see what it does _ just like a
human virus,'' said McCown. ``It had the ability to multiply and
move around and was designed to change its name so it wouldn't be
detected.''
   McCown, quoted in Monday's Dallas Morning News, said he wants to
make sure ``that this type of criminal understands that we have the
ability to make these type of cases; that it's not so sophisticated
or complicated that it's above the law.''
   USPA already has been awarded $12,000 by a jury in a civil
lawsuit filed against Burleson.

<TEXT>
   A yearling moose that rampaged across the
Washington State University golf course has died after authorities
tried to tranquilize it.
   ``Apparently the moose started chasing people, and for his own
safety they wanted to get him out of here,'' said Theresa Martz,
director of support services for the campus police department.
   As it was disrupting golfers and stomping on fences on Saturday,
an attempt was made to sedate the animal so it could be returned to
nearby Moscow Mountain.
   But the university police said in a statement that the animal
apparently had ``an adverse reaction to the drug in the
tranquilizer'' and died after it was administered.
   Officials at the College of Veterinary Medicine were performing
an autopsy on the moose to determine the exact cause of death. The
persons administering the tranquilizer were not identified.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Armenians Strike, March in Disputed Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Armenians stayed off their jobs and
marched in protest through Stepanakert, said a resident of the city
in Nagorno-Karabakh, a Caucasus Mountains region that has been the
focus of ethnic unrest.
   In a telephone call to The Associated Press in Moscow, a man
said several hundred people marched from downtown Stepanakert, the
largest city in Nagorno-Karabakh, to an Armenian cemetery on Monday.
   The caller hung up the receiver before a reporter could ask his
name and the purpose of the strike and march. Subsequent telephone
calls to Stepanakert did not go through or were unanswered.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is a region in the republic of Azerbaijan that
Armenians want made part of their neighboring republic.
   Most of the 160,000 residents of Nagorno-Karabakh are ethnic
Armenians, predominantly Christians. But since 1923 the region has
been part of Azerbaijan, most of whose residents are Moslem.
   Armenians in the region allege they are discriminated against
economically and culturally by Azerbaijani leaders.
   Strikes and street rallies began in Nagorno-Karabakh in
February, subsided and then began again March 24. That round of
walkouts tapered off gradually starting April 1.
   The latest round came two days after Communist Party officials
fired the two leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, apparently because
they had not quelled the ethnic unrest in the region, where at
least 32 people have died violently since February.
   The central government in Moscow has refused the demands to turn
the area over to Armenia, offering instead a plan for $690 million
in economic, social and cultural improvements for Nagorno-Karabakh.

   The 1,500 deputies of the Supreme Soviet
parliament opened their spring session today with an agenda that
focuses on domestic issues and does not include a vote on ratifying
the superpower missile treaty.
   Such a vote is not required by Soviet law, but could have been
used to ratify the treaty before the Moscow superpower summit
between Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan,
which begins Sunday.
   Gorbachev and the rest of the Kremlin leadership filed into an
ornate cream-colored hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace shortly
before 10 a.m. for the beginning of today's legislative session.
   The Supreme Soviet, a rubber-stamp body that gives force of law
to decisions already taken by the Communist Party leadership, then
adopted an agenda that focuses solely on domestic concerns.
   On Monday, the foreign affairs commissions of both houses of the
bicameral Soviet parliament endorsed the superpower
intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty and called on the
Presidium, the nation's highest executive body, to ratify it.
   The pact banning medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles was
signed by Gorbachev and Reagan at the Washington summit on Dec. 8
and does not become legally binding until it is ratified.
   The Soviets have repeatedly indicated that they are in no hurry
to ratify the treaty before the U.S. Senate does.
   Viktor P. Karpov, head of the Foreign Ministry's arms control
and disarmament desk, told Western reporters on Monday that his
country should not act until approval by the Senate is certain.
   ``We should be sure that we are not alone,'' Karpov said.
   At least 67 of the 100 U.S. senators must ratify the treaty
before it becomes binding on the United States, and a small band of
opponents have shown no signs of allowing the pact to be put to a
vote before the Moscow summit.
   Ratification by the Presidium, a body of 30-odd members headed
by Andrei A. Gromyko, the titular Soviet head of state, would
formally commit the Soviet Union to the treaty.
   Ratification by the Soviets has never appeared in question, as
the pact was approved by the ruling party Politburo and signed by
Gorbachev, who is Communist Party general secretary and a member of
the Supreme Soviet Presidium.
   The Supreme Soviet began its morning session today with several
personnel changes, including the appointment of Moscow party boss
Lev N. Zaikov to membership on the Presidium.
   On Nov. 11, Zaikov replaced Boris N. Yeltsin as head of the
party organzation in the capital after Yeltsin was fired in
disgrace. Yeltsin had questioned the pace of Gorbachev's program
for economic and social change at a closed-door meeting of the
party Central Committee the previous month.
   One bill lawmakers will vote on widens the possibilities for
citizens to form economic cooperatives, one of the ways Soviet
leaders are trying to ease shortages of goods and services in the
state-run economy.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov called the measure ``of immense
social and political significance.''
   The law, to take effect July 1, bars the state from seizing
property belonging to cooperatives and establishes a progressive
tax on income earned by co-ops.
   Ryzhkov said that in the three months since a draft of the new
law had been published, almost 6,000 co-ops have formed, compared
to 14,000 in the previous 18 months.
   He said Soviet authorities had not been able to stop
``speculators'' from taking advantage of the opportunities offered
by cooperatives but said that if citizens were productive there
could be no justifiable limit on their earnings.

<TEXT>
   The U.N. Command today accused North
Korea of trying to disrupt the 1988 Olympic Games by fabricating
false claims that war is looming on the Korean peninsula.
   U.S. Rear Admiral William Pendley, in a letter delivered to
North Korean officials, said an investigation of a recent spate of
claimed border violations found they were ``completely false.''
   ``These ridiculous actions by your side, that are obviously
designed to discourage participation in the forthcoming Seoul
Olympics, will convince no one and will be condemned by the world
community,'' Pendley said in the letter, which was released to the
press.
   North Korea has charged repeatedly in recent months that U.S.
and South Korean forces are preparing to start a war on the divided
peninsula to try and conquer the communist north.
   In Tokyo, President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique said today
that North Korean leader Kim Il Sung told him the north will not
take part in the Olympics.
   Chissano, who arrived in Japan on Monday after visits to North
Korea and China, told reporters that Kim Il Sung ``indicated the
(North Korean) position on the Olympics just by saying that North
Korea was not going to participate in the Games because they did
not want to condone the policy of two Koreas.''
   North Korea said in January it would boycott the Olympics after
its demand to co-host the Games was rejected by South Korea and the
International Olympic Committee. The committee said the Games are
awarded to a city and cannot be shared.
   South Korea and the committee have been urging the north to
reconsider and take part in the Games in Seoul, but Chissano's
statement indicated there was little hope Pyongyang would agree.
   South Korea, the United States and other nations charged that
North Korea was responsible for the Nov. 29 bombing of a South
Korean airliner that killed all 115 people on board. A
self-confessed North Korean agent said the plane was bombed to
disrupt the Olympics.
   Pendley, senior delegate to the United Nations Command, charged
that North Korea was conspiring to disrupting the Olympics by
fomenting tension with false charges of border incidents.
   ``The results of our investigations revealed that your charges
are completely false,'' he said.
   The UNC is a military command composed of U.S. and South Korean
forces. It deals with North Korean and Chinese delegates at
meetings of the Military Armistice Commission that polices the
cease-fire that ended the Korean War in 1953. Some 42,000 U.S.
troops are based in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   The command's statement was issued after South Korea refused
today to accept a North Korean letter calling for talks between
student delegations from the two nations on improving relations,
the South Korean Red Cross said.
   The South Korean Red Cross said in a telephone message to its
North Korean counterpart that the letter would not be accepted at
the border truce site of Panmunjom. The north called for student
talks on promoting reunification.
   The South Korean government insisted instead that the north
resume inter-government talks it broke off in 1986 to protest
U.S.-South Korean military exercises.
   The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter enemies that have
clashed repeatedly over the years. They fought the Korean War from
1950 to 1953 after the north invaded the south.

   As this suburb mourned a slain boy, police
formed a task force to investigate the final year in the life of a
woman who opened fire at a grade school, killing the child and
wounding five others.
   Police in a nearby suburb, meanwhile, said Monday they
considered the woman, Laurie Dann, dangerous enough two years ago
that they asked her parents to turn over her handgun. Her parents
refused, but promised to lock it in a safe deposit box, officials
said.
   Paper tulips hung from the ceiling of a second-grade classroom
Monday and more than 1,000 mourners, dozens of them children,
braved a downpour to crowd a synagogue where funeral services were
held for 8-year-old Nicholas Corwin.
   ``I never really knew that kids cared so much,'' said
11-year-old Brian Lewin, minutes before the memorial service ended.
``Now that he's dead, it's hard to think that so many people felt
that way.''
   Nicholas and four other youngsters were wounded Friday after Ms.
Dann burst into their classroom at Hubbard Woods Elementary School
and opened fire. She also shot an 8-year-old boy in a bathroom.
   After fleeing the school, she shot a 20-year-old man at a house
and killed herself after a nine-hour standoff with police.
   Police Chief Herbert Timm on Monday announced the formation of
the task force to investigate the final year in the life of Ms.
Dann, a 30-year-old baby sitter who police say was upset because
the family she worked for was moving.
   Police say tracing the trail of Ms. Dann's bizzare behavior has
led to the discovery of 15 or more poisoned food and fruit juice
packages, attempted firebomb attacks, hundreds of harassing
telephone calls and a possible stabbing attack on her ex-husband,
Russell Dann.
   ``Why couldn't it have been stopped? Here was a person reaching
out for help. She didn't get it. It was a matter of time before
this bomb exploded,'' Dann said Monday, criticizing police for
failing to heed warnings about her.
   ``I hired attorneys. I hired private detectives ... This was the
North Shore of Chicago reaching out for help, not just Russell Dann
... I'm not saying we got no help, but Friday happened,'' Dann said
on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   The Danns' three-year marriage ended in divorce in 1986.
   Dann also made a plea for gun control, saying it was
``horrible'' that his ex-wife was allowed to purchase a gun.
   ``On many occasions, we tried to get her arrested,'' he said,
but police did not pursue her case actively enough.
   Prosecutors have said they were investigating Ms. Dann, but had
not developed enough evidence to arrest her.
   Robert Bonneville, police chief of Glencoe, said authorities
asked her parents to surrender Ms. Dann's .357-caliber Magnum
handgun two years ago because of allegations that she had made
harassing phone calls and had committed theft.
   Her father, Norman Wasserman, refused, but ``agreed to have it
locked up in the safety deposit box,'' Bonneville said.
   One of the three guns Ms. Dann carried at the school Friday was
a .357-caliber Magnum, police said.
   The Wassermans as cooperative with police, Bonneville said, but
refused to believe their daughter was making the telephone calls
and took her side in the other incidents.
   In at least two cases, Bonneville said, Wasserman made
restitution to families for whom Dann worked as a baby sitter or
domestic after she was suspected in thefts of food and clothing
from the homes.
   The Wassermans refused to comment.
   Four of the children wounded in Friday's attack have been
upgraded from serious to fair condition and one remains in critical
but stable condition, hospital officials say. The wounded man was
upgraded from serious to fair condition.

   The U.S. dollar traded lower against major foreign
currencies in Europe today. Gold prices also fell.
   Early trading was quiet, with many traders on the Continent
extending a holiday weekend.
   ``Dollar dealing is very sleepy,'' said one exchange dealer with
a major Italian commercial bank. ``Most interest is on the cross
rates.''
   Traders predicted the dollar would remain in the narrow range
established after last week's better-than-expected U.S. trade
figures until fresh news or rumors move the market.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.55 yen to a closing 124.25. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 124.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.6996 West German marks, down from 1.7030
   _1.4165 Swiss francs, down from 1.4198
   _5.7485 French francs, down from 5.7570
   _1.9026 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9075
   _1,262.70 Italian lire, down from 1,263.75
   _1.2412 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2427
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8705, more expensive for
buyers than $1.8675 Monday.
   The price of gold weakened in quiet London trading in the wake
of overnight profit-taking that followed gold's rise above $460 an
ounce Monday.
   At midmorning, London's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $458.60 a troy ounce, down from an opening bid
of $459.40 and from late Monday's $459.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $458.90. The Zurich market was
closed Monday for a religious holiday celebrated in much of Europe.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 22 cents to close at a bid
$460.91.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid $6.72 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $6.70.

<HEAD>Ferry Towed To Port After Fire Kills Crewman In English Channel</HEAD>

   Fire broke out on a freight ferry carrying 75
people in the English Channel, and one crewman was killed and
another severely burned before firemen flown in by helicopter put
out the blaze early today.
   Emergency services on both sides of the channel, the world's
busiest waterway, launched a rescue operation when the fire began
in the ferry's engine room at 9:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. EDT) Monday.
   The fire was reported two hours after the Seafreight Freeway
left the southeast English port of Dover for the Belgian port of
Zeebrugge.
   Sealink U.K. Ltd., owners of the 5,917-ton ferry, said in a
statement that 15 firefighters and their equipment were flown by
helicopter to the vessel.
   It said the firefighters would remain aboard until the ferry
arrived at the French port of Dunkirk, where a tugboat was towing
it today.
   ``They had to extinguish a fairly serious fire in the engine
compartment, which caused quite considerable damage,'' the fire
brigade said in a statement.
   A British Royal Air Force helicopter airlifted the injured crew
member to the Kent and Canterbury Hospital in southeast England.
The hospital said his burns were critical.
   ``We understand ... that it (the cause of the fire) was a
fractured fuel pipe which caused fuel to leak over the port engine
room which then eventually caught fire,'' Chris Garnett, Sealink's
European director, said in a radio interview with the British
Broadcasting Corp.
   The Seafreight Freeway, built in 1981 and capable of carrying
about 70 trucks, has been on charter to Sealink since June 1986. It
operates between Dover, Britain's busiest ferry terminal, and
Zeebrugge and Dover and Dunkirk.
   Lifeboats, rescue tugs and helicopters from both sides of the
channel raced to the Seafreight Freeway when it reported the fire
28 miles off the southeast English coast.
   Other helicopters stood by in case passengers and crew had to
abandon ship.
   Firefighters found the dead crew member in the engine room after
extinguishing the blaze there. His body was put aboard a lifeboat
to be returned to England. The vessel sailed from Dover with 32
crew members and 43 truck drivers, Garnett told the BBC.
   On March 6, 1987 the British cross-Channel ferry Herald of Free
Enterprise capsized outside Zeebrugge, killing 193 people. The
Herald of Free Enterprise, carrying passengers and freight, went
down when water poured through the bow doors, which had been left
open as the vessel pulled out of Zeebrugge.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, faced with
deepening divisions in Iran's leadership, called on his supporters
not to stage a rally in the capital, Tehran Radio reported.
   The official radio, monitored in Nicosia, gave no reason for the
highly unusual request on Monday to scrap today's ``allegiance
march'' by the Shiite Moslem fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
   But diplomatic sources with contacts in Tehran, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said other recent pro-Khomeini
demonstrations led to violent protests against the Tehran regime
and against Iran's 7{-year-old war with Iraq. Several people were
reported killed and scores arrested.
   It was not clear whether Khomeini's request to cancel the march
was linked to the protests, which diplomatic sources and travellers
from Iran reported during and after the second stage of elections
for the Majlis, or parliament, on May 13.
   But it was believed that the regime was seeking to avoid
provoking more trouble in the capital, which has been badly
battered by long-range Iraqi missiles in a seven-week missile
exchange with Iraq that ended April 21.
   Iranian officials reported 1,500 people killed in the missile
blitz. But diplomatic sources said the death toll was closer to
3,000.
   Khomeini called last week for unity among Iran's leaders after
the elections in which radicals made sweeping gains and
conservatives fared badly.
   Khomeini said in an address broadcast by the state-run
television and radio network: ``A Majlis without diversity of views
is an imperfect Majlis ... But the outcome should not result in
dividing us into two hostile groups.''
   The leader, whose pre-election support for the radicals was seen
as a major boost for them, said there had been unspecified attempts
``to create discord,'' but that ``thanks to God, they did not
succeed.''
   In an apparent reference to deepening divisions between the
radicals, who advocate wider state control of the economy, and the
conservatives who support a more open capitalist system, Khomeini
noted:
   ``There are not two fronts. Of course, there are two ways of
thinking and it should be so,'' he said. ``But different tastes do
not mean that the people should not be on good terms with each
other.''
   Two senior Shiite clergymen, meanwhie, were reported to have
written an open letter to Khomeini appealing to him to end the
conflict with Iraq.
   But Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored
in Nicosia, on Saturday reported that the two ayatollahs, Mohammed
Reza Golpayegani and Shahbeddin Najafi-Marashi, ``categorically
denied that they had demanded an end to the war.''
   By some Western diplomatic estimates, as many as 1 million
Iranians have been killed or wounded in the conflict. The Iranians
have suffered several military and economic setbacks in recent
weeks.
   On Monday, an Iranian war communique said Iranian warplanes
heavily bombed Iraqi troops east of the border city of Basra in
five consecutive runs.
   Iranian land forces also repulsed an Iraqi attack near Sumar,
``completely routing and chasing the attackers into Iraq after
inflicting heavy losses,'' the communique claimed.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said on Monday that Iraqi jets
flew 145 combat missions and helicopter gunships flew 163 missions
against the Iranians, ``inflicting heavy losses and damage.'' The
Iraqi News Agency reported downing an Iranian Bell-214 helicopter,
but Iran denied the claim.

   Israeli troops opened fire on United Nations
peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, riddling an armored
vehicle with artillery and rifle fire, a U.N. spokesman said today.
   None of the U.N. troops was injured, said Timor Goksel,
spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.
   He said the peacekeeping force filed a protest with Israel's
army. An Israeli military spokesman said the army was investigating
the incident.
   Goksel said Israeli troops opened artillery fire late Sunday on
an armored personnel carrier, which was stamped with a U.N.
insignia and parked in a lighted lot within a position manned by
Norwegian peacekeepers.
   He said the Israeli troops kept firing on the position despite
two red flares fired by Norwegian troops to alert the Israelis to
the U.N. presence. The incident occurred near the village of
Ibl-es-Saki, north of Marjayoun, inside Israel's self-declared
``security zone.''
   Speaking in a telephone interview, Goksel said the armored
vehicle was hit by more than 60 rounds of artillery and rifle fire,
but there were no casualities.
   ``Both the U.N. checkpoint and the (personnel carrier) were
clearly marked and illuminated at night. There was absolutely no
problem in the area, it was wide open and lighted,'' Goksel said.
``We have protested the incident very strongly.''
   Tensions between Norwegian peacekeepers and Israeli troops grew
earlier this month when the Norwegians destroyed an unmanned
Israeli position established in the U.N. zone near Ibl-es-Saki,
U.N. officials said.
   The Israelis built the position at the time of the army's May 2
raid into southern Lebanon, a three-day incursion aimed at
destroying guerrilla bases north of the security zone.

<HEAD>Burt Lancaster Files $1.5 Million Suit Against Columbia Pictures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Burt Lancaster filed a $1.5 million
breach-of-contract lawsuit against Columbia Pictures, contending
the studio improperly fired him from the film ``The Old Gringo''
and replaced him with Gregory Peck.
   The suit, filed Monday in Superior Court, charged that
Lancaster, 74, was dismissed because the studio had trouble
obtaining cast insurance for him. Such insurance protects a
studio's investment in a film should an actor die or become
disabled.
   The suit seeks $1.5 million for the alleged breach of an oral
contract.
   ``Columbia had no right to terminate the agreement between the
parties based on an inability to obtain cast insurance ... until it
first notified (Lancaster) or his representatives of any potential
problem ... and allowed them to resolve it by various measures,''
the suit states.
   The suit also contends Columbia negotiated with Peck even before
Lancaster was fired.
   Studio officials could not immediately be reached for comment. A
telephone call to Columbia Monday night went unanswered.
   Lancaster declined to discuss the suit.
   According to the suit, the veteran actor and Columbia agreed
verbally in October 1987 that he would be paid a minimum of $1.5
million over a three-year period for his work. As part of that oral
agreement, the suit stated, the studio was to obtain cast insurance.
   Lancaster said the studio failed to notify him of the insurance
problems until it announced in December that he was being fired
because it was unable to secure insurance for him at customary
rates.
   Lancaster had quadruple bypass heart surgery in 1983. However,
the suit said a doctor determined in November 1987 that the actor's
heart conditon had stabilized and he was in good physical health.
   Lancaster, a former circus acrobat, established himself as a
star with his first film, ``The Killers,'' with Ava Gardner in
1945. He received an Academy Award as best actor in 1960 for his
portrayal of a Depression-era evangelical huckster in ``Elmer
Gantry.''

<HEAD>China Must Be Bold In Luring Investment, Deng Tells Corporate
Leaders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping today told the
chairmen of some of the world's leading corporations that China
must be bold in its efforts to modernize and attract outside
investment.
   ``We should now advance against difficulties head-on, and
guarantee the continuity of our policies and development,'' the
official Xinhua News Agency quoted Deng as telling the members of
Chase Manhattan Bank's International Advisory Committee.
   ``I often encourage my comrades to be bolder,'' it quoted him as
saying. ``In acting boldly, mistakes are hardly unavoidable. People
should be allowed to make mistakes.''
   Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, counselor to the
Chase committee, told a news conference after the meeting with
Deng: ``The impression he left was China is determined to pursue
its course and maybe accelerate it in the direction of a greater
market component in its economy.''
   ``It was an extraordinary impressive performance on his (Deng's)
part,'' said former Chase Manhattan Chairman David Rockefeller.
``He spoke with great simplicity and vision on China and the world
and confirmed my opinion and that of many others that he is one of
the great men of this century.''
   Chase's 25-member International Advisory Committee also met
today with Chinese Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang and Premier
Li Peng.
   The committee members, who include the heads of major
corportions such as Italy's Fiat Spa and the Netherlands' Philips
electronic giant, held their biannual meeting in Beijing on Monday
and today.
   In addition to the top leaders, they also met with Minister of
Finance Wang Bingqian, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Foreign
Trade Minister Zheng Tuobin.
   Rockefeller said their goal was not to advance individual
business deals but to learn about China's reforms.
   Deng, who began China's retreat from central planning toward a
partially market-regulated economy in 1978, was quoted by Xinhua as
telling the businessmen that price reform has become the toughest
problem.
   The process of lifting government controls that kept prices
artifically low has given rise to inflation that reached 11 percent
in the first quarter of the year.
   Nonetheless, Kissinger said Deng and other Chinese leaders
``seemed to feel they have no other way to go if they don't want to
be suspended in midstream'' in the reform process.
   Chase Manhattan Chairman Willard Butcher said the bank has no
plans to take advantage of China's recent moves to allow foreign
banks to set up full-service operations in China, including
accepting deposits.
   Foreign banks, including New York-based Chase, so far have been
limited to making loans to the government and Chinese and foreign
joint venture companies.

   Stock prices gained slightly while the dollar lost
ground in Tokyo trading today as traders reacted to lackluster
market performances abroad.
   The dollar closed at 124.25 yen, down 0.55 yen from Monday's
closing.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues moved up 62.90 points, or 0.22 percent, to end the
day at 27,312.66 points. The stock market's gain followed a
144.09-point tumble in trading Monday.
   Led by foreign exchange bank selling, the softer dollar
reflected an overnight weakening in New York, traders said.
   ``The yen is still strengthening ... with some profit-taking
from Europe,'' said King Ogino, a foreign exchange trader with
Goldman Sachs.
   ``Generally people are paying attention to interest rates and
the stock exchange and commodity markets. The soft exchange market
will keep a soft tone in the dollar market,'' Ogino said. ``The
money supply is not excessively high ... so people are buying yen
and selling marks.''
   Shares on the stock exchange also reacted to a slump in New
York. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11 points overnight in
the slowest trading Wall Street has seen this year.
   ``The gain on the Tokyo exchange was due largely to the purchase
of steel shares such as Kawasaki Steel and Nippon Kokan,'' said
Hitomi Sakano of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
``Otherwise trading was fairly normal, without any particular
market-motivating factors.''
   Electrical and automotive issues also advanced, traders said.
Pharmaceuticals, securities and banking shares were weak, while
nonferrous metals and shippings firmed.
   Domestic economic fundamentals remain strong, however, and a
monthly report issued today by the Economic Planning Agency said
the Japanese economy, backed by private consumption and increased
capital spending, has continued to expand in May.

<TEXT>
   Soviet experts, making their first visit
to a secret chemical warfare facility in Western Europe, today
watched as British soldiers in gas masks fought off a simulated
attack by an enemy using nerve agents.
   The display marked the official start of the Soviets' three-day
visit to Britain's Chemical Warfare Defense Center in Porton Down
in southwest England.
   It is part of an exchange program to promote progress on a
chemical weapons ban. ``It should facilitate negotations,'' Yuri
Nazarkin, chief Soviet negotiator at the 40-nation Geneva
Conference on Disarmament.
   The conference ended its spring session April 29 with no
breakthrough in sight on an agreement to ban development,
production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
   After watching the display by nine British soldiers, the 13
Soviet scientists and military experts entered the main buildings
of the British facility to begin talks with British experts.
   The visit, a week before the superpower summit, was billed by
British officials as the most detailed exchange of information to
date with the Soviets on chemical weapons by a Western European
power.
   ``We're not going to reveal all,'' Graham Pearson, director of
the facility, said. ``We're going to try to build confidence
between the United Kingdom and Soviet Union in respect of the
negotiations in Geneva.''
   Lt. Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich, deputy commander of Soviet Chemical
Troops, said after the display: ``If we consider it to be a
beginning, it is interesting and purposeful.''
   While nuclear weapons will be the centerpiece of the summit,
progress on a chemical weapons ban has so far proven elusive.
   At last December's Washington summit, President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for ``intensified
negotiations'' on a verifiable agreement covering all nations
capable of producing chemical weapons.
   Britain, which halted production of chemical weapons in the
1950s and destroyed its stockpiles in 1957, has been in the
forefront of the Geneva conference negotiations that have dragged
on for 20 years.
   As part of the exchange, British scientists and military experts
will visit the Soviet chemical warfare facility at Shikhany on the
River Volga. The Ministry of Defense said the exchange will be the
first between the Soviet Union and a Western European country
focusing on chemical warfare.
   The Soviet Union only acknowledged in early 1987 that it had a
chemical weapons stockpile amounting to 50,000 tons. One major
problem in the Geneva negotiations is that Western experts put the
Soviet stockpile at 300,000 tons.
   A British defense policy paper issued last week said: ``The
Soviet Union commands the world's largest, most comprehensive and
advanced capability for chemical and toxic agent warfare.
   ``The Soviet capability for chemical warfare far outstrips those
of the West and cannot be justified by any comparable threat from
NATO.''
   The United States, the only other country that acknowledges
possessing chemical weapons, has a stockpile estimated at 30,000
tons.
   It ended an 18-year moratorium on production in December when it
started manufacturing binary weapons, those made from two chemicals
which are harmless alone but lethal when they interact.
   Last October, specialists from the Geneva Conference visited
Shikany, where they were shown chemical weapons which seemed to
date from the 1950s. In November, Soviet inspectors visited a U.S.
Army chemical weapons disposal plant at Toole, Utah, where they
were shown techniques for destroying old gas munitions.
   Since Britain now has no chemical weapons, the Soviet delegation
will only see laboratories at Porton Down where toxic chemicals and
biological agents are tested against protective equipment such as
gas masks, clothing and monitoring instruments which are developed
for the armed forces.
   The facility also tests antidotes to chemical weapons.

   A statement purportedly issued by the
captors of foreigners in Lebanon said today the hostages would be
killed if their governments did not initiate direct negotiations
with the kidnappers.
   The threat was made in a typewritten Arabic statement signed by
the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad and delivered anonymously to a French
news agency reporter in Baalbek.
   The east Lebanon city is a traditional stronghold of Hezbollah,
or Party of God, the pro-Iranian group that is believed to be an
umbrella for the captors of 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   There was no way to verify the authenticity of the statement.
Islamic Jihad has said previously it would always send a picture of
a hostage with its statements. The latest statement was not
accompanied by such a photograph.
   The statement said: ``The Islamic Jihad Organization advises
countries interested in the hostages' problem to speed up direct
negotiations for their safety, because the application of pressures
as well as the current plans and recipes on the ground targeting
the Islamic fervency will lead to liquidating all the hostages and
throwing their dead corpses out.''
   It apparently referred to the Syrian military siege of south
Beirut's slums, the area where most of the foreign captives are
believed held.
   There has been no confirmed word from the kidnappers since
fighting broke out May 6 in the southern slumbs between Hezbollah
and the Syrian-backed Amal militia.
   The 18 hostages include nine Americans. Longest held is
Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson. He
was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The United States has said it would not negotiate with the
kidnappers. But as fighting raged last week in the slums where the
captives are believed held, Washington announced it would be
willing to talk to Hezbollah.
   The newspaper Ad-Diyar, which is based in Christian east Beirut,
reported today that Iran's deputy foreign minister, Hossein
Sheikholeslam, who has been mediating the Amal-Hezbollah conflict,
has taken some foreign hostages in his ``motorcade'' to the Iranian
Embassy in Beirut.
   The report, which named no sources, said Sheikholeslam later
``returned some of them (hostages) to the suburbs after the embassy
found out that Syrian intelligence agents were watching the
building.'' It said two American hostages remain in the embassy.
The newspaper did not identify them.
   Iran denied an earlier report that foreign hostages were taken
to the Iranian Embassy.

   A man who had been banned from a
bowling alley card room fatally shot a worker at the room, wounded
a customer and then killed himself, officials said.
   The man walked into the South Bowl card room Monday afternoon,
opened fire, then fled, police said. He wounded himself after
shooting at a patrol car that chased him into a parking lot.
   The gunman, 34-year-old Rodney Morrow, died at a hospital two
hours later, said Deputy Coroner Billy Guillot.
   Carey Unruh, who was wounded in the attack, was in critical
condition at University Medical Center, police said. The dead
worker was identified as Robert McGlone Jr., 30, the son of the
card room's owner.
   Morrow was banned from the card room about six or eight months
ago, said South Bowl night manager Shirley Arnold.
   ``I believe it was because of drug-related incident,'' she said
in a telephone interview.

   A jetliner went off the runway and
smashed through a fence while trying to take off, but all 22
passengers and crew fled the aircraft minutes before it burst into
flames.
   Ten people were treated for minor injuries following the
accident Monday. The Lacsa Boeing 727-100 carried eight crew
members and 14 passengers, including seven Americans.
   ``Miraculously, there were no deaths,'' said Juan Manuel
Fernandez, financial vice president of Lacsa, the Costa Rican
airliner.
   Lacsa Flight 628 was scheduled to stop in Managua, Nicaragua,
before continuing to Miami.
   Officials said the jet left the terminal of the Juan Santamaria
International Airport at 4:55 p.m., headed down the runway and
crashed through a fence surrounding the airport after failing to
take off.
   The plane came to a stop about 600 yards beyond the fence on a
grassy area, where it burst into flames. The aircraft broke into
three sections.
   ``During takeoff, for unknown reasons, the plane left the
runway, stopping finally outside the airport boundary,'' said the
Lacsa statement.
   ``After the successful evacuation of all the passengers and crew
members, the plane was consumed by flames,'' it said.
   The wreckage was still blazing 1{ hours after the explosion and
wreckage was spread over a wide area.
   ``Thanks to the skill of the pilots, they were able to evacuate
the passengers, just a few minutes before the plane burst into
flames,'' Fernandez said.
   Co-pilot Armando Rojas told reporters that the passengers
remained calm.
   ``With nerves of steel we were able to evacuate all the
passengers,'' Rojas said. ``A few minutes later, maybe five
minutes, the plane burst into flames.''
   In addition to the Americans, the passengers included a West
German, two Cubans living in Miami, two Nicaraguans and two Costa
Ricans, the airline said. The crew was Costa Rican.
   Fernandez told reporters the cause of the explosion was under
investigation by officials of Lacsa, Boeing and the Costa Rican
civil aviation agency.
   Witnesses said flames shot up more than 130 feet after the
explosion.
   The plane broke into three parts, with the cockpit in one
section and the passenger cabin split in two, witnesses said.
   Fernandez said the plane was 16 years old and was leased a year
ago from Avensa Leasing Corp., a subsidiary of the Venezuelan
airline Viasa.
   He said the jet was not originally scheduled to be used Monday.
It was put into service after another flight to Miami, via New
Orleans, was overbooked.
   It was Lacsa's first accident in its 43-year history, he said.
   Lacsa owns four Boeing 727s, two of them purchased from Boeing
Co. in August 1978, said David Jimenez, a spokesman for the
aircraft maker in Seattle.
   The three-engine planes can hold approximately 160 passengers
and require three crew members in the cockpit, Jimenez said.
   Boeing produced 1,831 of the planes before discontinuing the
model in 1984.
   Michael Carter, 23, rushed to Miami International Airport after
hearing on television that there had been a crash. He said his
stepfather, David Jones, was flying to Miami from San Jose on
Monday.
   After learning there were no deaths reported in the crash,
Carter said: ``I'm going to see if I can find a drink, I need one.''

<HEAD>Ex-Envoy Says Dropping Indictment May Be Acceptable</HEAD>

   The United States should accept a ``fair
trade'' that removes Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power in
exchange for dismissal of the drug indictment against the
Panamanian ruler, a former American ambassador to Panama said today.
   ``If we want Noriega to leave Panama, we can't keep up an
indictment that simply locks him in,'' Ambler Moss, ambassador to
the Central American nation from 1978-82, said on NBC-TV's
``Today'' program.
   Moss said the indictment against Noriega was a ``bad mistake''
that should now be secondary to changing the political situation in
Panama.
   ``If the rest of the package worked out to be all right _ for
instance Noriega departs from power, a mechanism is put in place
for free elections and other parts of the package look all right _
then it may be a fair deal,'' Moss said.
   U.S. officials have said that, under one arrangement, Noriega
would leave Panama in August and return after the May 1989
presidential elections. They said Noriega would have a hand in the
selection of an interim government, which would serve until the
elected government takes office.
   But the Reagan administration has come under increasing pressure
to halt its negotiations with Noriega, and Vice President George
Bush moved away from the White House stance last week as the
dealings became an issue in the presidential campaign.
   Noriega has remained in power even though the United States in
February began applying pressure, including economic sanctions.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, also interviewed on the ``Today'' program,
said the Noriega dealings have been a ``foreign policy
embarrassment for the Reagan adminstration.''
   ``There was an underestimation of (Noriega's) determination and
his capacity to hang on,'' said Cranston, a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   Moss said the White House has ``displayed poor political
judgment'' in using intelligence reports from Panama on Noriega's
entrenchment.
   ``It isn't a question of not having the information, but a
question of what they did with that information. They misjudged the
character of Noriega; they certainly misjudged the effect of
economic sanctions. From one step to another, the whole thing was
badly mishandled,'' Moss said.

   Striking scriptwriters and producers met for
the first time in more than a month and talked for nearly eight
hours, but reached no agreement to end the walkout that has delayed
the start of the fall TV season.
   The afternoon session Monday resulted in several closed meetings
between a federal mediator and top negotiatiors for the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers and the striking Writers
Guild of America.
   ``The parties met under auspices of a federal mediator. Although
we can report no substantive progress, another meeting has been
tentatively scheduled for Wednesday,'' said Writers Guild of
America spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   Before the meeting, federal mediator Leonard Farrell told
reporters he called for renewed bargaining ``simply because I
believed it was time,'' referring to the 12-week-long strike and
industry job losses.
   Producers have said the strike has cost the industry more than
$15 million in lost jobs and production time, with about 1,400
clerical workers, cast and crew members laid off.
   WGA President George Kirgo said he believed the producers were
beginning to ``feel the impact of no scripts and no new
production.''
   The session at the producers alliance headquarters was
apparently more fruitful than a mediated April 18 meeting, which
ended after only 20 minutes. A March 14 meeting also failed.
   Farrell sat down Monday with Kirgo, WGA West Executive Director
Brian Walton, East Coast WGA Director Mona Mangen, alliance
President Nicholas Counter III and alliance Vice President Carol A.
Lombardini.
   Nearly 100 negotiators, attorneys and advisers for both sides
gathered in other conference rooms to discuss new ideas and
proposals.
   ``They are talking. And there's plenty to talk about,'' said
alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg.
   The walkout began March 7 over creative control on the set and
residual payments for both one-hour syndicated television show
reruns and works distributed in foreign countries.
   The renewed bargaining came four days before writers were
scheduled to meet and consider whether to approve independent
contracts, which would allow some production companies to resume
work.
   About 80 companies have been negotiating for waiver contracts
with the WGA, Ms. Rhoden said. She added that she had no estimate
of how many contracts might be considered and approved by members.
   Leaders of the 9,000-member guild are recommending that West and
East Coast members ratify the independent contracts in hopes of
shortening the walkout, she said.
   Steinberg said the signing of the independents would not affect
negotiations, because they represent less than 10 percent of
feature film and 15 percent of television production.
   The fall television production season usually begins in late
June or early July, but approved and edited scripts in hand are
vital for production to begin. Those scripts are usually being
evaluated by this time of year.

   The Communist Party will consider at a June
conference a proposal to limi party officials to two five-year
terms, but it is uncertain whether the change would apply to
general secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a top official said today.
   ``This is a big step in the development of intraparty
democracy,'' Karl Vayno, party leader of the Estonian republic,
said in an interview with Western correspondents.
   Current terms for party jobs are unlimited, and longevity is one
of the key ways Communist Party officials build their personal
power and maintain privileges in their city, region or at the
national level.
   Vayno, one of the more than 300 members of the policy-making
Central Committee, discussed the committee's meeting Monday during
a break in a session of the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal
parliament.
   The Central Committee discussed and approved the party's
blueprint for the June 28 special party conference, which other
officials say is shaping up as a show-down between backers of
Gorbachev seeking radical changes in the Communist Party and those
who want limited changes.
   Other officials have said earlier that limits on terms of office
would be considered at the party conference, but Vayno provided
more detail on the proposal after it had been accepted by the
Central Committee for discussion.
   One proposal is to limit all elected party leaders, from cities
and local regions all the way to the ruling Politburo, to two
five-year terms, Vayno said.
   But he said there were other proposals to exclude certain party
jobs, including Gorbachev's, from the limitations. He said it was
uncertain what the conference would decide.
   Asked his personal view, he said it ``depends on the
personality.''
   ``If the vote is about Gorbachev, I would vote with both hands
to exclude him,'' Vayno said.
   Gorbachev has urged the Commuunist Party to adopt means of
ensuring turnover in top party positions, and asked by the
Washington Post in an interview last week whether he supported
limited terms of office he answered ``yes,'' but did not elaborate.
   The Central Committee also agreed to place reforms in the
electoral system for government positions before the party
conference, Vayno said. He did not elaborate.

   A landslide near this southern city
buried five houses, killing at least seven people, a constabulary
report said today. Twenty-three people were missing.
   Seven bodies have been recovered from the scene of the landslide
in the seaside Kinanga village in Don Marcelino town, and rescue
teams are still digging for the other victims, disaster officials
said.
   In Manila, the state-run Philippine News Agency quoted a Red
Cross official as saying continuous rains caused the landslide. The
report said the five houses had been built on a hillside.
   A pregnant woman and two children survived the landslide, the
news agency said.
   Kinanga is in Davao del Sur province, some 100 miles south of
Davao and 650 miles southeast of Manila.

<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sequoyah Nuclear Plant reactor was
restarted today, one day after shutting down for the second time
since May 13, a Tennessee Valley Authority spokeswoman said.
   The Unit 2 reactor started up at 3:25 a.m. and was reconnected
to the TVA power system at 6:05 a.m., said spokeswoman Janice
Brady. Within four hours of the restart, the reactor reached about
30 percent power, she said.
   Sequoyah was automatically shut down at 12:28 a.m. Monday
because of an instrument problem in its reactor coolant system,
said Joe Bynum, TVA's assistant manager of nuclear power.
   It was the reactor's second shutdown since it was restarted 11
days ago after a 33-month shutdown for safety reasons.
   However, TVA officials said the two shutdowns were no cause for
concern.
   ``It was a relatively minor instrumentation problem that we can
correct,'' Ms. Brady said. ``As we've said repeatedly, because of
the complexity of any nuclear plant, it's not uncommon for a unit
to automatically shut down.''
   Bynum said the incident, evaluated Monday by a Tennessee Valley
Authority investigative team, represented no danger to plant
employees or the general public.
   At the time of Monday's shutdown, Unit 2 was approaching 75
percent power _ about the same level as on May 19 when a water
gauge problem caused the reactor to shut down.
   The reactor was restarted Saturday after repairs and
adjustments. Plant workers were calibrating a transmitter that
provides readings on reactor water flow when the second shutdown
occurred.
   The employees put the transmitter in the ``trip,'' or off,
position, then detected a trip signal from one of two other
transmitters in the same reactor loop that indicated low water
flow, said Ms. Brady. Four such loops are in each reactor.
   The reactor's transmitter system is designed to automatically
shut down the reactor when two out of the three transmitters in a
loop send trip signals, she said.
   When Sequoyah's Unit 2 went back on line May 13, it became the
first TVA reactor to do so since the federal utility shut down its
nuclear program in August 1985 because of safety concerns.
   TVA tentatively expects Sequoyah Unit 1 to be back on line by
September, and Unit 2 at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant outside Athens,
Ala., by year's end.
   The federal utility, which has been relying on hydroelectric and
coal-fired plants while its nuclear system has been idled, provides
power to customers in Tennessee and parts of Kentucky, Virginia,
North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi.

   A man prosecutors say was a Southern
California crime family leader has been sentenced to 10 years in
prison on drug and conspiracy charges.
   Luigi Gelfuso Jr., 62, pleaded guilty last month to one count
each of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to use
extortion to collect a gambling debt and conspiracy to violate
labor laws by taking money to guarantee a movie was made with
non-union workers.
   His sentencing came Monday, a week after his reputed boss, Peter
John Milano, received a six-year sentence. The two were among 15
people indicted last year on extortion, racketeering and drug
trafficking charges.
   When the indictment was announced, U.S. Attorney Robert C.
Bonner said, ``The main body of La Cosa Nostra in Los Angeles has
been severely gutted.''
   Seven of those indicted were sentenced last week, including
Milano, under a plea bargain. Sentences ranged from 10 years in
prison to five years' probation.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Rose 0.8 Percent in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods rose 0.8 percent in April, boosted by a jump in
orders for military communications equipment, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$116.3 billion last month.
   It was the third consecutive monthly increase and followed gains
of 0.9 percent in March and 0.1 percent in February.
   Analysts had worried that declines in new orders in November and
January indicated some softening of the economy in the wake of the
October stock market crash, but the increase in April confirmed
most analysts' views that the economy is now growing robustly. Most
had expected a rise about in line with today's report.
   Overall, orders in April were 8.5 percent ahead of a year
earlier.
   In April, a large increase in orders for new military
communications hardware more than offset declines elsewhere in
electrical machinery, contributing to a sharp 4.4 percent increase
in that category. It followed a 3.7 percent drop in March.
   Orders in the volatile defense goods category rose 1.4 percent,
following a big 15.1 percent increase in March. Orders excluding
defense goods rose 0.8 percent to $106.3 billion.
   There was also strength in primary metels such as steel. Orders
rose 0.2 percent following a 5.5 percent increase in March.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good
sign of business expansion plans, rose 1.4 percent last month
following a 3.9 percent decline. But at $32.9 billion, orders were
still 15.1 percent ahead of last year.
   Orders for civilian aircraft, particularly to Boeing Corp.,
increased. But that was more than offset by a decline in orders for
military planes, leading to an overall 0.3 percent decline in the
transportation category, following a 2.8 percent increase a month
earlier.
   There was also a decrease in orders for non-electrical
machinery. They fell 1.3 percent following a 2.5 percent increase
in March.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 1.1 percent in April to $112.6
billion, following a 3.0 percent increase in March.

   Paul served up his shrimp creole, Brad grilled
some steaks, and Maida brought her favorite brownies. Fifteen more
people crowded into the kitchen, baking hors d'oeuvres, heating
soup, tossing salads, whipping up more desserts.
   Whoa, folks! Too many cooks!
   But wait a minute. These are not ordinary cooks. They are 18 of
America's finest chefs and, in their rarefied world of toques and
wire whisks and $300 pots, they know better than to spoil the broth.
   The chefs and their helpers from Boston to San Francisco and
from New Orleans to the Michigan lake shore thronged the vast
kitchen of the Capital Hilton Hotel on Monday night to prepare a
``gourmet gala'' of their specialties for 750 guests.
   Proceeds from the $250-a-plate benefit went to the March of
Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, which is celebrating its 50th
anniversary this year. The chefs were chosen by Pierre Franey, food
columnist for The New York Times.
   The banquet hall was no place for dieters.
   For starters, there was dungeness crab and smoked salmon rolled
in chive and pepper-flecked pancakes with horseradish cream, a
creation of Kathy Casey, the 27-year-old Seattle sensation with
spiked blonde hair.
   After seven other hors d'oeuvres and Jeremiah Tower's spicy
lentil soup, there were steaming bowls of Paul Prudhomme's shrimp
creole from New Orleans followed by filet mignon with morel sauce
and pasta by Bradley Ogden of San Francisco and a spring salad by
Jasper White of Boston, featuring grilled leeks stuffed with goat
cheese.
   Groaning diners then faced choosing from a half-dozen desserts
guaranteed to bust the calorie meter. There were chess pies, lemon
and white chocolate tarts with rum sauce, bread puddings with
Michigan dried tart cherries, strawberry shortcake, brownies,
cookies and ice cream.
   Among the chefs are several who quit successful careers in other
fields to pursue their love of cooking.
   One is David Liederman, who said he ``went to sleep'' after
practicing law for three months. ``When I woke up I decided I liked
the food business better,'' said Liederman, who became a cookie
mogul in Manhattan and now operates Chez Louis restaurant in New
York and a specialty food business.
   Another is Harlan Peterson, who gave up a promising career
designing automobiles for Ford Motor Co. in Detroit when he got
serious about his after-hours hobby of cooking. ``I had a glamorous
job at Ford but I felt like a small cog in the machinery,'' he said.
   Peterson apprenticed at a lake shore inn at Ellsworth in
northwest Michigan, and opened his own Tapawingo Restaurant there
in 1984. He specializes in such indigenous foods as whitefish,
trout, game and sauces using morel, the locally grown mushroom
favored by serious chefs.
   Maida Heatter of Miami, who brought 25 boxes of her famous
``Palm Beach brownies'' for the gala dinner, abandoned a successful
career as a fashion illustrator and artist to care for her ailing
father, former radio commentator Gabriel Heatter, at her home.
   To help keep her creative juices flowing, Ms. Heatter persuaded
her husband, Ralph, to quit his job as an airline pilot and open a
restaurant in Miami Beach. The deal was that she'd supply him with
brownies, which she'd been baking since childhood.
   They made headlines by selling elephant-meat omelets during the
Republican National Convention in Miami Beach in 1968. Ralph got
out of the restaurant business in the mid-1970s but Maida's
reputation as a dessert expert flourished.
   She prepared the desserts for President Reagan and six other
allied leaders at the 1983 economic summit in Williamsburg, Va. At
the urging of food critic Craig Claiborne, she has written five
best-selling dessert cookbooks and just completed a sixth.
   ``I love to cook,'' says Ms. Heatter, a serenely elegant,
white-haired woman. ``Nothing else has given me such satisfaction
as taking something out of the oven and it's perfect.''
   ``Cooking is very therapeutic for many people. People who can't
cope, who go to shrinks and take pills, write me that when they get
into the kitchen they are happy, they start getting along with
their husbands, and their kids don't bug them anymore.''
   Ms. Heatter loves chocolate the most. ``There's no other food
that can take its place,'' she says. ``Sometimes I can eat a very
large meal, but unless there's some chocolate at the end I don't
feel it's finished, like not having a period at the end of a
sentence.''

<TEXT>
   Thunderous blasts of tank and artillery
fire jolted Beirut today as fighting between Shiite Moslem factions
escalated after the collapse of Syrian and Iranian talks aimed at
reining in their allies.
   In east Beirut, right-wing Christian militias clashed overnight
in a resurgence of a power struggle within the Christian community.
Police said one person was killed and four were wounded.
   Police said 15 people were killed and 42 wounded today as the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal fought one of
their heaviest duels yet in Beirut's southern slums. The casualties
raised the toll since the Shiite fighting broke out May 6 to 294
killed and 993 wounded.
   Police said Hezbollah was inching toward Amal's last stronghold
in the 16-square-mile enclave where most of the 18 foreign hostages
are believed held.
   There has been no confirmed news on the fate of the hostages
since the fighting began. Lebanese reports have said the captives,
who include nine Americans, have been moved several times.
   Also today, a statement signed by Islamic Jihad, which claims to
hold some hostages, said the captives would be killed if their
governments did not initiate direct negotiations with the
kidnappers.
   There was no way to verify the authenticity of the statement.
Islamic Jihad has said it would always send a picture of a hostage
with its statements, but no photograph accompanied the statement
left at the home of a reporter today.
   The statement said: ``The Islamic Jihad Organization advises
countries interested in the hostages' problem to speed up direct
negotiations for their safety, because the application of pressures
as well as the current plans and recipes on the ground targeting
the Islamic fervency will lead to liquidating all the hostages and
throwing their dead corpses out.''
   One daily, Ad-Diyar, which is published in Christian east
Beirut, reported today that two American captives are being held at
the Iranian Embassy. The report, which did not name the hostages,
could not be verified independently.
   Iran last week denied that foreign hostages were being held in
its embassy.
   A police spokesman said Amal militiamen withdrew today from
positions in the Ghobeiry district under a fierce barrage of
howitzer and mortar fire.
   Amal fighters withdrew to the district of Shiyah at the northern
edge of south Beirut, said the spokesman, who cannot be named under
standing regulations.
   Hezbollah controlled the southern and western flanks of Shiyah
and its gunners were pounding Amal's threatened supply lines at the
northern edge of the area, he said.
   ``Hezbollah has managed to achieve some gains across the
Ghobeiry positions,'' an Amal communique said.
   It said Hezbollah gunners blasted Shiyah and the surrounding
area with 1,500 shells in a nine-hour barrage.
   Meanwhile, a Hezbollah statement accused Amal of
``indiscriminately bombarding'' areas under the party's control in
south Beirut.
   T-54 tanks and multi-barrel rocket launchers mounted on trucks
at Amal positions in Shiyah poured gunfire into Hezbollah's
territory. Hezbollah fired back with 155mm howitzers and 120mm
mortars.
   Police said both sides also traded grenades in hit-and-run
forays.
   The escalation followed Syria's rejection of a proposal by Iran
for the deployment of a joint peacekeeping force in the slums.
Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud, Syria's military intelligence chief for the
Beirut area, said the Iranian proposal was ``out of the question.''
   Such an involvement would strengthen Iran's influence in Lebanon
while Syria is seeking to eliminate sectarian rivalries and end the
country's 13-year-old civil war.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss called Monday for Syrian
military intervention ``without delay'' to end the Shiite militia
fighting.
   Syria has had about 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored
vehicles massed around the area's narrow alleyways and cement-block
shanties for the last 10 days. The buildup came after Hezbollah
seized 90 percent of the urban battleground in the first week of
fighting.
   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally in its 7{-year-old war with Iraq.
But Hezbollah's move to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites has
strained that alliance.
   The east Beirut fighting pitted President Amin Gemayel's
Phalange Party irregulars against fighters of the Lebanese Forces,
the Christians' main militia.
   Police said both sides used machine guns and rocket-propelled
grenades in the duels, which raged through the night. The fighting
began after Lebanese Forces ambushers shot and wounded Nabil
Kahhaleh, Phalangist commander for the Sin el-Fil district of
Beirut.

   A small jet crashed and exploded
early today in a wooded area near a 900-unit condominium complex
here, killing two crew members and two passengers, authorities said.
   No one was injured on the ground as the plane plowed into a
rocky hillside; it narrowly missed several homes and landed in the
back yard of one home, about 25 feet from a house, authorities said.
   The twin-engine Learjet crashed shortly after 3 a.m. on Garrett
Mountain, within 50 feet of the 900-unit Westmount Village complex,
said Police Chief Joe Renney.
   ``We heard the impact and when we came outside, we saw the whole
thing in flames,'' said Tula Savickas, in whose back yard the plane
came to rest. ``We couldn't see anything, it was just one
tremendous flame.''
   The jet shattered on impact, making it difficult at first to
determine the number of victims and to identify the craft, Renney
said. Police said woods and a road were aflame with burning jet
fuel when they arrived at the scene.
   The jet had departed Teterboro Airport en route to Morristown
Airport, according to Kathleen Bergen of the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   The regional office of the National Transportation Safety Board
sent three investigators to the scene.

<HEAD>Peter O'Toole Ordered to Return Son to Former Lover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today ordered actor Peter O'Toole to
return his 5-year-old son, Lorcan, to American Karen Somerville so
courts in the United States can decide which parent should get
custody of the boy.
   Lawyers said High Court Family Division Judge Sir Stephen Brown
ruled in a private hearing that it was in the boy's best interests
that he be returned to his mother's care in Middleton Township,
N.J., pending a court hearing there.
   The couple have been fighting over their son since they parted
in 1983, and a New Jersey court already has given them joint
custody.
   The Irish-born O'Toole, 55, refused to return the boy when his
scheduled 10-day visit to Britain ended in early May, lawyers for
Ms. Somerville said.
   The 37-year-old former model, who according to court records
took the actor's name but was never married to him, had sought a
court order forcing O'Toole to return her son.
   Both declined to comment as they left the court today.
   The hearing began Monday, with O'Toole and Ms. Somerville forced
to sit only 30 feet apart in the courtroom. News reports said they
refused to look at one another.
   The lawyers did not say when Lorcan, the Irish version of
Lawrence, would return to the United States.
   O'Toole is known for such films as ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and
``The Lion in Winter.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc today threatened to hold early national elections in an
escalating political struggle with the Labor Party, its coalition
partner and chief rival.
   The jockeying over dates followed a shift in popularity to Likud
prompted by voters' fears of violence in the five-month Palestinian
uprising.
   Likud's threat to push for elections on Aug. 23 came after
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' left-of-center Labor Party proposed
separating national and municipal elections, both now scheduled for
Nov. 1.
   ``It is worth holding early elections because many things have
not been decided,'' Shamir told reporters while touring the
northern town of Yoqneam. ``If possible, we should shorten to gain
time and to avoid public nervousness.''
   Transport Minister Chaim Korfu was quoted by the daily Haaretz
today as saying, ``Labor is trying to violate the coalition
agreement again, and therefore there's no point in continuing the
partnership.''
   News reports say Labor wants to separate national and city
balloting so Likud's new popularity would not threaten Labor's hold
on municipal offices. In response, Shamir's party called for
elections in August when many of Labor's middle-class backers are
on vacation abroad.
   In Jerusalem's walled Old City, Likud legislators Dov Shilansky
and Ovadiya Eli toured the sacred Temple Mount, guarded by some 400
policemen, Israel army radio said today. The mount is one of the
holiest sites in Islam.
   The radio quoted Shilansky as saying he intended to show ``the
Jewish presence'' on the site, which also houses the remnants of
the ancient Jewish Temple.
   Police barred a group of activists of the Jewish group Temple
Mount Faithful from entering the area after their leader, Gershon
Salomon, called Moslem official Sheik Jamal Rifai an agent of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, Israel radio said.
   Meanwhile, police safely dismantled a bomb planted near the door
of a house in the Jewish neighborhood of Gilo, a police spokesman
said.
   In the West Bank, a spokesman for the military government said
damage was done to some Arab schools used as bases by soldiers
during the Palestinian uprising and at least one school in Nablus
was seriously vandalized.
   Israeli news reports said windows, chairs and desks were smashed
at the Khalduniya school in Nablus. Anti-Arab slogans were scrawled
on the walls and there was excrement found in some of the rooms on
Sunday, according to the Jerusalem Post and the Haaretz.
   ``There was serious damage in some of the schools, but we are
taking care of everything and repairing it,'' said Olivier
Rafowicz, army government spokesman. ``We repair it and we pay for
it.''
   Rafowicz stressed the army had used only 30 of more than 1,194
West Bank school buildings.
   Many schools in the area were used by the army as headquarters
and temporary detention centers during the four-month, army-imposed
closure of schools in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip which
kept 475,000 Palestinian students from class.
   On Monday, the army administration reopened the West Bank's 612
elementary schools and kindergartens, serving 203,000 Palestinian
youngsters.
   The army cited a drop in violence as the reason for reopening
schools. Rafowicz said that ``over 90 percent of students and all
the teachers showed up for classes.''
   The PLO-linked leaders of the uprising, who call themselves the
United National Leadership, said in their latest underground
leaflet that ``our glorious victory by going back to school proves
our slogan that we learn in whatever circumstances.'' The latest
leaflet, No. 17, was circulated in the West Bank on Monday.
   The leaflet also called for a one-day general strike on
Wednesday to mark 40 days since the assassination of PLO military
leader Khalil Wazir, or Abu Jihad, who is widely believed to have
been killed by Israeli commandos.
   In another development, a Palestinian woman, Muneira Daoud, was
charged with causing serious bodily harm for allegedly hurling a
stone at a Jewish settler that prompted him to open fire and
accidentally kill an Israeli teen-ager in the West Bank village of
Beita.
   According to Israeli media reports, Ms. Daoud stoned settler
guard Romam Aldubi after he shot and killed her brother and another
Arab during a clash involving Jewish settler hikers and
Palestinians on April 6.

<HEAD>Four Gay Rights Activists Interrupt BBC Evening News Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a striking display of British aplomb, a BBC
newscaster coolly read out the events of the day while her
co-anchor, off-screen, sat on a gay activist who burst screaming
onto a live evening TV news broadcast.
   Viewers of the British Broadcasting Corp.'s 6 p.m. newscast
Monday heard a few unintelligible howls from the woman activist and
three fellow demonstrators protesting a new law banning the
promotion of homosexuality.
   ``We have rather been invaded,'' said anchorwoman Sue Lawley
after the women entered the studios at the start of the show and
handcuffed themselves to objects around the room.
   Beside her, co-anchor Nicholas Witchell took action.
   ``I found she had handcuffed herself to Sue's desk so I sat on
her and put my hand over her mouth,'' he said. ``I thought we would
be taken off the air but Sue, very calmly, kept running through the
introduction to the first piece.''
   Miss Lawley, who did not flinch during the bedlam, asked viewers
to try to ignore what was going on in the background. She said
later, ``it was a very alarming experience.''
   She closed the show by apologizing to viewers and telling them,
``Our unwelcome guests have now been taken away by the police.''
   Tony Hall, BBC's editor of news and current affairs for
television, said, ``What happened this evening was intolerable.
We'll make sure it doesn't happen again.'' He said the BBC would
investigate how the women entered the studio.
   Police said the four would be released because no allegations of
criminal offenses had been made against them.
   Rachel Cox, speaking for the group, said they wanted to
interrupt the news in order to protest Clause 29, which bars local
authorities from intentionally promoting homosexuality, such as
through grants to centers for homosexuals. The law took effect at
midnight.
   She said, ``this is a further statement of lesbian defiance''
against the law. Last year, women protesters climbed from the
public gallery onto the floor of the House of Lords during debate
on the bill.
   The clause has been criticized by homosexuals and the arts
community as a threat to artistic freedom. Critics claim it could
lead to the censorship of writers who are homosexuals.
   Proponents of the measure say it is intended to prevent local
governments from using taxpayers' money to teach children that
homosexuality is acceptable.

<HEAD>Advisers Support ``People's Union,'' Say Rival Parties
Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Soviet sociologist says citizen groups
advocating new policies could be formed to advise the Communist
Party leadership, but that formation of rival political parties
would be unconstitutional.
   Tatiana Zaslavskaya, a sociologist and party adviser, said
Monday she supports the idea of ``social institutions or peoples
unions'' to assist the nation's only legal political party.
   Speaking at a news conference, Ms. Zaslavskaya and prominent
political scientist Fyodor M. Burlatsky dismissed the efforts of
dissident groups to form a separate political party challenging the
Communist Party. They said the Communist Party's monopoly on power
is protected by the Soviet constitution.
   Some independent citizen panels championing causes such as
protection of the environment and historic preservation already
have been formed, but Ms. Zaslavskaya did not make clear to what
degree she supports the existing groups.
   She mentioned that an organization such as a ``peoples union''
or popular front could be formed to promote Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reforms. Such organizations exist in other East
European countries that are controlled by Communist parties.
   Formation of an umbrella popular front to bring together the
independent groups would allow the government and party to retain
control over public debate and discussion, while at the same time
giving Soviets an opportunity to take part in the political
decision-making process.
   A group of dissidents announced May 9 that they had formed the
Democratic Union, a new party to challenge the current one-party
system.
   ``Those who suggest forming a new party are going beyond the
constitution,'' Burlatsky said, describing those efforts as
``childhood diseases of pluralism.''
   ``The leading role of the Communist Party is not just
traditional, but the constitutional norm,'' he added.
   But Burlatsky, like Zaslavskaya, said Gorbachev's efforts to
introduce more democracy and openness into Soviet society mean
broader distribution of power among the people.
   ``I don't see any social background for creation of a second
party,'' Ms. Zaslavskaya commented. ``But the Communist Party in
some way should be supplemented with social institutions or peoples
unions. This would contribute to the consolidation of perestroika.''
   Zaslavskaya appeared to criticize the party's monopoly on power
when asked about the system for selecting the 5,000 delegates to
the June party conference. She is a candidate to become a
conference delegate.
   ``The fact that the party delegates are selected by the party
machinery, by the party committees, effects the procedure, and not
in every case can it be called a democratic effect,'' she said.
   Zaslavskaya advises the party leadership and her ideas have been
broadly incorporated into the reform campaign since Gorbachev came
to power.

<HEAD>Don't Expect Quick Transformation of Soviet System: Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan praised the Kremlin for
making progress across a spectrum of human rights issues but said
the West should not expect there will be ``a quick, radical
transformation of the Soviet system.''
   Reagan, setting the stage for summit talks in Moscow with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, said he hoped to conclude a treaty to cut
strategic nuclear arsenals before his term expires in eight months
but acknowledged that might not be possible.
   ``It is the requirements of a good treaty and not some arbitrary
deadline that will determine the timetable,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan made his remarks in an address beamed across Europe today
on the United States Information Agency's ``Worldnet'' satellite
service. The speech was taped Monday in the Oval Office.
   The president will leave Washington on Wednesday, bound for
Helsinki, Finland, and a four-night stopover before traveling on to
the Soviet Union. He will arrive in Moscow on Sunday and
immediately launch his fourth summit with Gorbachev.
   Reagan said talks with the Soviet Union must be guided by
realism about what can be achieved.
   ``We do not expect a quick, radical transformation of the Soviet
system,'' the president said. ``We do not expect to turn a corner
one day to find that all our problems have gone away because our
adversary has been transformed.
   ``We must continue to fulfill our own responsibility to stand
firm and vigilant, to provide the incentive for a new Soviet policy
in contrast to the old,'' Reagan said.
   ``For there still remain profound political and moral
differences between the Soviet system and our own,'' he added.
   Reagan and Gorbachev will have five official meetings, wrapping
up their talks June 1. Later that same day, the two leaders and
their wives will attend a special ballet peformance at the Bolshoi
Theater and then dine at Gorbachev's dacha, or country home,
outside Moscow.
   Aside from his talks with Gorbachev, Reagan also will meet with
monks, dissidents, writers, artists, filmmakers and students,
lending encouragement to reforms underway in the Soviet Union and
expressing hope for more change.
   ``In Moscow, I will welcome the progress we've seen in the human
rights record, especially since the end of 1986,'' Reagan said. He
said more than 300 political and religious prisoners have been
released from labor camps.
   ``Emigration, still too low, has improved,'' he said.
   ``Many cases of divided families and separated spouses have been
satisfactorily resolved. And censorship of films, books and other
creative works has eased,'' Reagan said.
   ``Yet despite this progress, the human rights situation in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is far from good,'' the president
said. ``Repressive policies persist.
   ``Peaceful demonstrations by national minorities, refuseniks and
others are still being broken up by police,'' he added. ``Freedom
of religion is still being denied, and members of unregistered
religious groups are still being persecuted.
   He also said unofficial publications are banned, dozens of
political and religious dissenters remain imprisioned and ``many
prisoners of conscience are still being held in psychiatric
hospitals. Freedom of movement is still restricted.''
   Reagan said the United States ``will continue to press the
Soviet Union to improve its practices in these vital areas _ in
short to grant full recognition of fundamental human rights.''

   Doctors weren't able to save the life of a
10{-month-old boy who was the last survivor among four children
with rare multi-organ transplants. However, a pioneer in the
experimental surgery said that the child's experience helped
doctors learn that organ rejection can be prevented.
   Michael Steward of Rockford, who received a liver, small bowel,
pancreas and a portion of his stomach in February, died Sunday of
multiple organ failure, said Carolyn Reed, a spokeswoman at Rush
Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center. The hospital announced the
death Monday.
   Michael was the youngest of four children in the nation who
received a multi-organ transplant, doctors said.
   Dr. James Williams, who performed the experimental surgery, was
out of town Monday and could not be reached for comment. But Dr.
Thomas Starzl, a Pittsburgh physician who is considered a pioneer
in the field, praised doctors at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's for
their efforts to save Michael.
   ``They were treating a child who otherwise had no hope,'' Starzl
said by telephone Monday night.
   Three-year-old Tabatha Foster of Madisonville, Ky., was the
world's longest survivor of a multi-organ transplant. She underwent
surgery Nov. 1 to replace her liver, pancreas, small intestine and
parts of her stomach and colon; she died May 11 in Pittsburgh after
an infection caused her heart, kidneys and liver to fail.
   Starzl, Tabatha's doctor, said that even though both she and
Michael died, ``there were some very positive sides'' to what
doctors learned through their treatment.
   ``In both these cases we learned we could prevent rejection of
these organs,'' he said.
   ``What will be done now is to take a careful look at the
autopsies and try to assess the prospects of future multi-organ
transplants,'' he said.

   Eli Lilly and Co. has decided not to sell
the government a potent herbicide to destroy coca plants in Peru, a
decision that drew sharp criticism from the State Department.
   In announcing its decision Monday, Lilly said only that ``while
the company recognizes the critical importance of the U.S.
government's efforts against illicit drugs, a number of practical
and policy considerations preclude our participation in this
specific program.''
   The Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company would not explain
those considerations.
   The sale of the herbicide reportedly would have earned Lilly $25
million.
   State Department officials have been planning to spray the
herbicide tebuthiuron on tracts of coca plants in the Huallaga
Valley in Peru, which officials say is the source of much of the
cocaine produced in Latin America.
   But tebuthiuron is thought to have strong, long-lasting effects
as a defoliant that causes ecological damage.
   Ann B. Wrobleski, the State Department's assistant secretary for
international narcotics matters, called Lilly's decision
``surprising'' and ``unconscionable.''
   Ms. Wrobleski said Monday the company's decision was perplexing
because the government is looking at five or six herbicides and has
yet to complete tests.
   ``I have no indication that there is any environmental problem
with this chemical,'' she said.
   ``Is Eli Lilly saying, `We choose not to be part of the solution
to the cocaine problem'?'' Ms. Wrobleski asked.
   The company produces Spike, the brand name for tebuthiuron, for
retail sale.

<TEXT>
   The Colombian navy said a convicted
kidnapper who used a toy hand grenade to hijack a Colombian
airliner was captured this morning in a swamp near the
international airport of the Caribbean coast city of Cartagena.
   No one was injured in the 11-hour hijacking, which began during
a morning flight from Medellin to Bogota and ended when the plane
landed in Cartagena Monday night. All 128 passengers and the three
flight attendants were freed shortly after the Avianca Boeing 727
was commandeered.
   During the hijacking, a lone man claiming to have hand grenades
forced the plane to fly to Panama and Aruba. He demanded $100,000,
saying he was dying of cancer and wanted the money so he could live
out his days happily in Cuba.
   The aircraft unexpectedly landed in Cartagena after the flight
crew persuaded the hijacker that they did not have enough fuel to
reach Cuba.
   Authorities knew nothing about the change of plans and were
caught off guard. As the jet taxied in the darkness toward the
Cartagena terminal, the hijacker lowered the rear stairway, jumped
out and escaped.
   The suspect was found at dawn today hiding in a swamp on the
edge of the airport, the navy said. He was being examined by
doctors.
   The navy said the suspect, Gonzalo Carreno Nieto, used a toy gun
four years ago to kidnap an uncle.
   Carreno spent nine years in prison after being charged with
murder, lawyer Guillermo Garcia said. He eventually was found
innocent and set free, but had become emotionally unbalanced in
prison and turned to crime and drug abuse, Garcia told the radio
network Caracol.
   At a news conference in Cartagena, pilot Luis Eduardo Gutierrez
said of the hijacker: ``He wanted the $100,000 so he could spend
the last few days of his life happily. He told us he had nothing to
lose and that he would explode a grenade he carried in his hand if
we failed to obey his instructions.''
   The jetliner had left Medellin on a flight to Bogota, Colombia's
capital 250 miles southeast.
   Shortly after takeoff, passenger Javier Robledo said, the
hijacker gave a note to a female flight attendant. Robledo, who was
sitting next to the man, said the stewardess led the hijacker to
the cockpit.
   The passengers and the flight attendants left the plane when it
returned to the Medellin airport.
   With only Gutierrez, the co-pilot and a flight engineer left on
board, the hijacker ordered the plane to Panama.
   The plane landed at Omar Torrijos International Airport outside
Panama City, where soldiers took up positions in ditches around the
aircraft.
   A three-man negotiating team approached the plane and spoke
through the intercom after the hijacker forced the crew to cut off
communications with the control tower. The man demanded $100,000,
said Capt. Miguel von Seidlitz, airport security chief.
   ``We explained to him that because of our financial crisis that
was impossible. And he understood,'' said von Seidlitz said.
   After the plane was refueled, it flew to Aruba.
   On and off for the next 2{ hours, authorities talked with the
hijacker by radio. Michael Dijkhoff, public relations manager at
the airport in Aruba, said the hijacker repeated his demands for
money and to be taken to Cuba.
   Without warning, the plane took off at 6:15 p.m. It had not been
refueled or resupplied.
   Dijkhoff said the hasty departure ``was a surprise. Radio
communication was cut off. All of a sudden, the engines started and
the plane took off.''
   Gutierrez radioed the control tower that he was heading for
Cuba, Dijkhoff said.
   ``Our most difficult moments came in Aruba when the hijacker
realized he couldn't get the money there, either,'' said Gutierrez.
``I told him that he could probably get it in Cartagena, and he
agreed we go there.''

   The pace of existing homes sales slowed in the
first three months of 1988 as 28 states and the District of
Columbia posted declines from last year's record levels, a real
estate trade group said today.
   The National Association of Realtors said Minnesota, with a 39.3
percent decline, suffered the biggest setback of any state during
the January-March period, when compared with sales during the same
period of 1987.
   In all, 20 states suffered declines of 10 percent or more. Of
those, nine states posted drops of more than 20 percent. The sales
pace picked up in 21 states and held steady in one, Washington.
   Nationally, existing homes sold at an annual rate of 3.66
million units during the quarter, 8 percent lower than a year ago.
   ``Although there were more resale decreases than increases, many
of the declines were in comparison to a surge in sales during the
first quarter of 1987,'' said John A. Tuccillo, the realtors' chief
economist.
   Despite the decline, association officials said sales were still
strong. They noted that sales in early 1987 were propelled by
relatively low interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages, which fell
to nine-year lows of 9 percent to 9.5 percent, on average. Rates in
the first quarter of this year were about a percentage point higher.
   While sales were falling, prices were rising. Honolulu, which
was included in the survey for the first time, supplanted New York
as the costliest housing area in the nation. Median prices in
Honolulu were $198,400. In New York and its suburbs, the median was
$186,600.
   They were followed by Orange County, Calif., $183,300; San
Francisco, $178,800, and Boston, $176,900.
   The least costly housing area was Louisville, Ky., where the
median home cost $51,100. Lansing, Mich., was next at $54,400,
followed by Des Moines, Iowa, $54,500; Grand Rapids, Mich.,
$55,400, and Oklahoma City, $56,500.
   Washington, D.C., had the largest price jump for the quarter.
The median home cost $132,400, up 24.7 percent when compared with a
year ago. Washington was followed by Hartford, Conn., where prices
climbed 21.8 percent and Providence, R.I., where prices increased
19.9 percent.
   Tuccillo said price increases were held back somewhat in New
York City and in other financial centers by the October stock
market crash. The increase in New York was 10.2 percent.
   Forty-four of the 61 metro areas surveyed posted price increases.
   Housing prices dropped in some areas heavily dependent on either
oil or farming. Oklahoma City posted the largest drop, 9.5 percent,
followed by Houston, 7 percent, and Denver, 6.9 percent.
   Nationally, prices rose 4.1 percent to a median of $88,100,
meaning half the houses sold for more and half for less.
   In addition to Minnesota, other states with large declines in
the pace of sales were Colorado, with a 31.4 percent drop;
Arkansas, down 25.2 percent, and New Hampshire, down 24.8 percent.
   By contrast, Alaska recorded a 77.1 percent increase in sales,
followed by Kentucky, with a 28.6 percent rise; Vermont, with a
25.8 percent pickup, Nevada, up 23.7 percent, and West Virginia, up
18.9 percent.

<HEAD>Charges of Sexism Prompt Changes in Dartmouth Song</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dartmouth College, which began admitting
women 15 years ago, has changed the name of its school song from
``Men of Dartmouth'' to ``Alma Mater'' in response to pressure from
alumni and female students.
   The new version ``celebrates the presence of men and women as a
single community on this campus,'' James O. Freedman, president of
the Ivy League school, said Monday.
   A group of alumni and students two years ago began considering
changes for the song, although a campus poll last year indicated 61
percent of the students did not want the song changed.
   Also changed was the opening phrase, ``Men of Dartmouth,'' which
became ``Dear old Dartmouth.''
   ``Chivalric faith'' was replaced with ``undying faith,''
``sons'' with ``ones,'' and one reference to ``brother'' with
``sister.''
   The original lyrics were written in 1894 by Dartmouth alumnus
and poet Richard Hovey.
   Many members of the college community fought the revision and
for the past several years, whenever the song was sung, shouted out
the lyric that told Dartmouth men to stand firm ``lest the old
traditions fail.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet army's march home from
Afghanistan is being slowed by Moslem guerrillas who are attacking
troops still positioned in the eastern part of the country, sources
said today.
   Western diplomats based in Islamabad said reports indicate
Soviet forces will not meet their deadline of withdrawing 25
percent of their estimated 115,000 troops by the end of the month,
as announced by Soviet Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov before the May 15
pullout began.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to support
the country's Marxist regime.
   ``It is difficult to see how the 25 percent withdrawal this
month, promised by Gromov, will be achieved,'' said a diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Reports said Afghan guerrillas have in the past week attacked
Soviet-Afghan convoys along the Soviet withdrawal route north and
west of the capital of Kabul, as well as in the eastern provinces
near the border with Pakistan.
   ``The regime has lost 18 district towns since mid-March, an
unprecedented string of losses with tactical implications,'' said
the diplomat.
   Afghan sources in Peshawar said they had no figures on the
number of troops who have returned to Soviet territory.
   Guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Masood, who controls a large
portion of the mountainous region north of Kabul, reportedly agreed
not to fire on Soviet troops if they withdraw peacefully.
   Control of the eastern part of Afghanistan opens strategic new
supply routes to the guerrillas, who are slowly pushing their way
toward the capital.
   Photographs of some of the captured military posts show the
Soviets left behind large amounts of weapons, supplies and
vehicles, indicating they made a hasty retreat.
   As Soviet military support decreases, Afghan President Najib is
expected to concentrate his forces around Kabul.
   Hundreds of government forces have either surrendered or
defected to the insurgents since the Soviet pullout began,
according to diplomatic sources. Exact figures were not available.
   Guerrilla leaders have said their goal is to make Afghanistan a
Moslem republic.

   An East German died after ramming his
car into a border gate in an attempt to escape to West Germany,
government officials said today.
   They also said another East German drowned last week while
trying to swim across the Baltic Sea to West Germany. The man's
body washed ashore Wednesday on the West German side of Luebeck
Bay, the West German Ministry for German-German Relations said.
   ``The federal government is disconcerted by these deaths, and
reminds (East German officials) that denial of free movement tempts
people to risk their lives,'' the ministry said in a statement.
   Witnesses on Monday saw a car with East German license plates
crashing into a steel gate at the border crossing near Helmstedt,
West Germany, about 60 miles east of Hanover.
   After the incident, in which the car appeared to be seriously
damaged, the witnesses saw East German officials cover the driver's
body with a blanket, the ministry said.

<HEAD>NHTSA Probes Alleged Sudden Acceleration in GM C-body Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal engineers have broadened their
examination of alleged sudden acceleration problems in General
Motors cars, adding 1.4 million C-body cars to the 703,000 H-body
vehicles already under study, it was announced today.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was
opening an engineering analysis of the C-body cars _ 1985-88 model
year Oldsmobile 98s, Buick Electras and Cadillac Devilles and
Fleetwoods _ because they can accelerate suddenly to produce a
``significant increase in engine speed and power output.''
   The agency said it has received 110 complaints of sudden
acceleration in the cars, allegedly resulting in 67 accidents in
which 43 people were injured.
   Since November, the agency has been investigating GM's H-body
cars.
   The agency had received more than 500 complaints of sudden
acceleration or throttle control problems in those cars, the
1986-87 Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Buick LeSabre, and the 1987 Pontiac
Bonneville, resulting in more than 300 accidents.
   An engineering analysis is the second-highest level of
investigation used by NHTSA in its monitoring of auto safety. The
probe of the C-body cars was opened in response to a petition by
the Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group often at odds with
the auto industry and its regulators.
   GM was preparing a response to NHTSA, said GM spokesman John
Hartnett.
   ``As far as we're concerned, we're cooperating with them,''
Hartnett said. ``Just because it is an engineering analysis and the
petition has been granted certainly doesn't mean that there is a
defect. It is not unusual for NHTSA to do this. It has been done in
the past.''
   Asked if there were throttle design similarities between the
C-body and H-body cars, Hartnett said the company had found no
mechanical cause for sudden acceleration in the H-body cars.
``Comparing the systems doesn't help anything. The fact is, we
haven't found anything,'' he said.
   But Sam Cole of the Center for Auto Safety said the C-body and
H-body cars ``share similar mechanical components, and that's why
we believe that those cars may experience a sudden acceleration
problem that is as bad or worse than the H-body cars.'' The cars
use the same electronic cruise control system, Cole said.
   Other sudden acceleration engineering analyses and cases listed
in the report involve the 1986-88 Honda Acura and Sterling and the
1986-87 Mercedes 300E, as well as two that have resulted in
recalls: the 1979-87 Nissan 280Z and 300Z and the 1978-86 Audi
5000.

   Thunderstorms rumbled along the East Coast today, killing a
woman in North Carolina and unleashing winds up to 72 mph that cut
power to as many as 55,000 homes in three states.
   A Florida weatherman and a cameraman also were hurt by an
explosion in their van resulting from a strong wind.
   Powerful thunderstorms hit the Middle Atlantic coast from
southeastern New York to Delaware; showers and thunderstorms
extended from western Pennsylvania to eastern South Carolina.
Scattered light showers fell across New England.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms lingered over Alabama and
Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. A few
light showers dampened Kansas and Oklahoma.
   On Monday, fierce thunderstorms downed trees and power lines,
knocking out electricity to 23,000 homes in the Baltimore area,
9,000 homes in the Washington area and up to 23,000 homes in North
Carolina, utility officials said.
   In North Carolina, high winds blew the roofs off five apartment
buildings in Burlington, forcing the evacuation of 50 people, said
the Alamance County communications office.
   A 37-year-old North Carolina woman was killed Monday night when
lightning struck a tree, severing a large limb that fell on the
truck she was driving.
   Another woman was seriously hurt in a separate accident when her
car crashed during the storm, the state Highway Patrol reported.
   At Piedmont Triad International Airport in the Winston-Salem
area, winds were clocked at 72 mph, just 2 mph below hurricane
strength.
   In Jacksonville, Fla., a weatherman and a cameraman for a local
TV station suffered burns when a gust of wind pushed the antenna on
their remote-broadcast van into a power line.
   The 24,000-volt charge surged through the van's wiring, causing
electrical equipment inside to explode, Paul Baldwin, news director
for WLTV-TV Channel 12, said of the noontime Monday accident. The
accident happened just after a live broadcast from the town of
Atlantic Beach.
   Both men were listed in fair condition today.
   In Demopolis, Ala., state troopers said small hail caused a
five-car pileup with two minor injuries.
   And in Centreville, Ala., the National Weather Service recorded
hail the size of quarters, although no traffic problems or damage
were reported.
   In western Maryland, stiff winds blew a porch roof off an
apartment house near Cumberland, but no injuries were reported,
State Police said. A house was flooded in Friendsville, and
flooding stranded motorists or closed roads in northwest Baltimore
and Montgomery County near Washington.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama to the Atlantic Coast states;
scattered showers and thunderstorms in the lower Mississippi Valley
and eastern Oklahoma; and widely scattered thunderstorms from
northeast Nevada into western Montana.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 70s or 80s in most
of the nation; 60s along the Pacific Coast and over the Great
Lakes, the northern Ohio Valley and northern New England; 50s
across Upper Michigan; 90s over parts of Georgia, Florida and
Texas; and 90s to 105 degrees across the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EDT time ranged from 42
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 86 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.
   Other reports were unavailable from the National Weather Service.

   Police have arrested two more members of
a gang that killed seven people and wounded 21 in two terrorist
attacks, a government spokesman said today.
   Security sources, speaking anonymously under government rules,
said all five suspects now in custody carry Lebanese passports and
claim to be Palestinians affiliated with terrorist leader Abu Nidal.
   The suspects said they were retaliating for the April killing in
Tunisia of the Palestine Liberation Organization's military
commander, Khalil Wazir, the sources reported. Palestinian groups
and others said Wazir's assassination was carried out Israeli
commandos.
   However, Sudan's prime minister had earlier ruled out
Palestinian involvement in the May 15 attacks on the Sudan Club and
Hotel Acropol in Khartoum.
   Information Minister Abdallah Mohammed Ahmed, the government's
official spokesman, said the suspects had confessed their roles in
last week's attacks. The final two suspects in the attacks were
arrested Monday.
   Gen. Ibrahim Ahmed Abdel-Karim, Khartoum's inspector of police,
said last week the first three suspects said in their confessions
that the attacks were directed ``against American and British
interests'' in the northeast African nation.
   All the deaths, mostly of foreigners, occurred at the Hotel
Acropol, where two bombs went off outside the dining room as guests
sat down for Sunday dinner. Shortly afterward, men opened fire with
submachine guns at the front gate of the Sudan Club, reserved for
British and Commonwealth nationals.
   In a nationwide broadcast Friday, Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi,
said, ``I rule out (any) relationship between the operation and a
Palestinian national group.'' He suggested the attackers could have
been hired by Israel to plant ``the seeds of doubt between Sudan
and the Palestinian struggle.''

   President Joaquin
Balaguer has fired the heads of the national police and air force.
   The action came Monday without any warning or official
explanation.
   Presidential decrees designated Col. Nelson Jose Morillo
Rodriguez as the new chief of police and Col. Fausto Miguel Cruz
Ramirez as head of the air force. Both were promoted to major
general.
   There was no explanation of why Gen. Fernando Aristides Sanchez
Aybar was dismissed as police chief or why Gen. Hector Miguel Roman
Torres was removed as head of the air force. Neither man was given
a new assignment.
   Morillo Rodriguez, the son of a former police chief, is the
fourth police chief appointed by Balaguer in his 22 months in
office. Sanchez Aybar was appointed March 3 during demonstrations
protesting the rising cost of living.

   Films with a sense of history, including
Danish director Bille August's ``Pelle the Conqueror'' and Clint
Eastwood's ``Bird,'' dominated the 41st annual Cannes Film Festival.
   ``Pelle the Conqueror'' on Monday won the Golden Palm award as
best film. American actor Forest Whitaker took the best actor prize
for portraying jazz great Charlie Parker in the film ``Bird,''
directed by Eastwood.
   Three performers shared the best actress award _ American
Barbara Hershey, South African Linda Mvusi and 13-year-old Jodhi
May of Britain _ for the British film ``A World Apart.'' The film
about an adolescent's awakening to South Africa's apartheid system
also won the festival's Special Jury Grand Prize.
   August, who also wrote ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' received his
prize from French film star Gerard Depardieu and Italian director
Ettore Scola, president of the 10-member festival jury.
   ``Pelle the Conqueror'' (``Pelle Erbreren'') is based on a novel
by Martin Anderson Nexo. It tells the story of Lasse and his
9-year-old son Pelle, who leave Sweden in the 19th century to work
as cattlemen on a farm in Denmark. There, they are treated like
slaves until Pelle revolts and goes out to make his way in the
world.
   Film star Max von Sydow plays the father, Lasse. Dane Pelle
Hvenegaard, 13, plays Pelle.
   August said he intends to continue his work with historical
settings. He said his next film will be shot in the United States
and set during the Civil War.
   ``Bird,'' which opens next week in France, received a great deal
of media attention during the festival because Eastwood was in
Cannes and because the French public has a long-term love affair
with American jazz. Saxophonist Parker, whose bebop swing
influenced a generation of jazz players, is well-known in France
three decades years after his death.
   Whitaker, who also appeared in ``Platoon'' and ``The Color of
Money,'' was joined on stage to accept the award by Eastwood.
   ``Bird'' also won the technical excellence award in recognition
of its soundtrack.
   It was the second year in a row that Miss Hershey won the best
actress award. Last year, she took the prize for her performance in
``Shy People.''
   The film for which she won this year, ``A World Apart,'' is
based on the true story of Shawn Slovo, an adolescent whose parents
were anti-apartheid activists. The film looks at South African race
relations through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl, Miss May, whose
father flees and whose mother is imprisoned.
   ``A World Apart'' was the first film by director Chris Menges.
   Indian director Mira Nair won the Golden Camera award given to
the best young director for her film ``Salaam Bombay,'' shot in the
streets of that Indian city, that tells the story of a group of
destitute children.
   ``Salaam Bombay'' was the first full-length film by the
30-year-old Indian director, who was trained at Harvard University.
   The prize for best director went to Fernando Solanos of
Argentina for his film ``The South.''
   Other awards went to British director Peter Greenaway, honored
for best artistic contribution for his film ``Drowning by
Numbers.'' The award is given in recognition of a film's
originality and visual innovation.
   The jury prize went to Polish director Krzystof Kieslowski for
``A Short Film About Killing.''
   Soviet director Gary Bardin's film ``Ornaments'' took the Golden
Palm for best short film, Hungarian director Ferenc Cako's film
``Tracks in the Sand'' won the best animated film award, and French
directors Yann Piquer and Jean-Marie Maddedu won best short fiction
film for ``Bodybuilding.''

   A federal magistrate today ordered the Honduran
ambassador to Panama held without bond on charges of trying to
smuggle 26 pounds of cocaine into the United States.
   Rigoberto Regalado Lara, 49, was arrested May 15 at Miami
International Airport when the drugs were discovered in his
luggage. Honduran officials immediately stripped him of diplomatic
immunity.
   Today Regalado's attorney, David Rothman, sought to have him
freed from the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he has been
held since his arrest.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Odilio Diaz said the ambassador was
``an extreme risk of flight,'' noting that if Regalado fled to
Honduras, he could not be extradited back to the United States.
   U.S. Magistrate Samuel Smargon ordered Regalado held without
bond, but said the matter could be raised at next week's
arraignment hearing.

   Pakistan recently test-fired a missile capable
of carrying a nuclear weapon, according to a report in today's New
York Times, but Pentagon sources said they doubt it and Pakistani
officials denied it.
   A Pakistani source said the missile was launched at a test range
in southern Pakistan's Thar Desert on April 25, and that it was
capable of reaching the Indian cities of Bombay and New Delhi, the
newspaper reported.
   The Times quoted a source with ties to the Pakistani government
as saying the missile was of ``home design'' and produced with the
help of Chinese experts.
   The newspaper also said a Reagan administration official, who
asked not to be identified, confirmed that such a test firing had
been conducted.
   However, a senior Pakistani Defense Ministry official in
Islamabad, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``I have no
information whether or not such a missile exists.''
   Moreover, two Pentagon officials Monday night said they are
unaware of such a test and do not believe Pakistan has any missile
capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.
   ``To our knowledge, Pakistan does not have any missile,
long-range or tactical, capable of delivering a nuclear device,'' a
senior Pentagon official said.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
they do not believe Pakistan has acquired any missiles from any
other nation.
   Pakistan is widely reported to have the capability of building
nuclear weapons, or to be close to it.
   Such reports have been circulating since late April, when India
announced it had developed a long-range missile.
   Neighboring India exploded an atomic device in 1974.
   Moslem Pakistan and Hindu India have fought each other three
times since they became separate nations in 1947.

   A Missouri dairy farmer was sentenced to
death today for the slaying of his wife and two nephews in a
September shooting spree that left seven family members dead.
   Judge John E. Parrish followed the recommendation of the jury
that convicted 37-year-old James Schnick last month and imposed the
death sentence. The alternative would have been life in prison
without parole.
   Schnick will be the 60th inmate of death row in Missouri. The
Missouri Legislature approved the death penalty in 1977, but no one
has been executed in the state since 1965.
   Schnick was convicted April 14 for killing his wife, Julie
Schnick, 30, and nephews, Kirk Buckner, 14, and Michael Buckner, 2.
   Schnick also was accused but not tried in the deaths of his
wife's brother, the man's wife, and the couple's two other sons.

   A police officer jumped on the hood of his
patrol car and fired three shots through the windshield to stop a
man from stealing the vehicle.
   Police Cpl. Gene Strickland and his partner stopped a pickup
truck for a routine violation about 9:30 p.m. Monday and were
talking to the driver when another man ``came from out of nowhere''
and jumped into the cruiser, said police spokesman Steve Cole.
   The car struck Strickland before he jumped on the hood, Cole
said. The cruiser had traveled about 100 feet when Strickland fired
the shots.
   The driver, Christopher Keenan Dexter, 24, was shot in the chest
and arm and was listed in stable condition at St. Joseph Hospital,
Cole said.
   Strickland, 31, was treated for cuts and bruises at Tampa
General Hospital. He was placed on administrative leave pending an
investigation, which is standard procedure in shooting incidents,
Cole said.

   A storm that killed 78 people in one province of
southeastern China has wrecked 1,000 homes elsewhere, it was
reported Tuesday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said 42 bridges were also
damaged and 1,200 miles of highway flooded in Jiangxi province. No
casualties were reported.
   The rains, which began Friday, dumped up to a foot of water on
some parts of neighboring Fujian. Officials have reported 78 people
dead in the northern part of the province, more than 200 injured,
and more than 3,100 forced to flee their homes.
   Unusual weather has plagued much of China this month. Hailstorms
killed at least 24 people and injured more than 250 in coastal and
central China, and a tornado in Guangdong province in southeastern
China killed five people.

<TEXT>
   Liang Yifeng, one of socialist China's
youngest millionaires, says he's too busy making money to think
about politics.
   ``I don't pay much attention to politics,'' said the 31-year-old
entrepreneur who in a few years has amassed a personal fortune he
estimated at 2 million yuan (about $540,000).
   But Liang, owner of a color photo developing and printing
service, has enough political savvy to say with assurance that in
present-day China, ``to be rich is a good thing.''
   Liang spoke to a group of foreign reporters who visited his
three-story home Monday on a tour led by officials of the southeast
coastal city of Fuzhou.
   Liang, who also heads the city Private Entrepreneurs'
Association, was proudly introduced by the officials as a man
``inspired by the policy of opening to the outside world and
invigorating the domestic economy.''
   China, under senior leader Deng Xiaoping, has encouraged private
initiative in business in the past decade. The government
acknowledges that Deng's market-oriented reforms will mean some
people get rich faster than others.
   Only a few years ago, a person with 10,000 yuan ($2,700) was
considered extremely rich by Chinese standards. Now, in a nation
where the average worker still earns only about 1,000 yuan ($270) a
year, million-yuan earners such as Liang are increasing.
   Liang, flanked by his legal adviser and a leader of the local
Chamber of Commerce, said he started working as a mason at age 14
and had only two years of formal education.
   In 1980, with $54 to his name and a Chinese Seagull-brand
camera, he opened a shop to develop black-and-white pictures.
   Working 13 hours a day, he expanded the business into a brightly
lit color photo shop with 15 employees on a main corner of this
city of 1 million people.
   He already has purchased two $35,000 Kodak automatic processing
and printing machines, and has imported a third machine worth
$78,000.
   Fuzhou officials said he's the city's first entrepreneur to
introduce foreign advanced equipment.
   Liang, tieless and wearing a white shirt typical of Chinese
office workers, said he has living expenses of about $270 a month
and his biggest luxury is smoking.
   But last year he also completed a $81,000 home hidden down a
narrow alley in the downtown area. He lives there with his father,
a former glasscutter, a younger sister and about 12 shop employees
to whom he gives free room and board. He is not married.
   The concrete floors and walls provide a proletarian atmosphere,
but the color TV and stereo in his bedroom, the chandeliers with
blinking colored lights and the brass cuspidors in the stairways
add a touch of luxury.
   Liang said his four principles are trust, quality, customer
service and obedience to the law.
   The Chinese government also intones four principles of loyalty:
to socialism, to Marxist-Leninist-Mao Tse-tung thought, to the
dictatorship of the proletariat and to the Communist Party.
   Liang insisted there is no contradiction between the two. His
wealth, he said, ``has brought prosperity to society,'' adding that
he pays about $35,000 a year in personal and business taxes.
   ``No one has ever called me a capitalist,'' he said.
   Liang attributed his success partly to the government's reform
policies. ``The people of Fuzhou have a saying: `Thanks to Deng
Xiaoping, with wine every day we can sing.'''

   One of the seven remaining defendants in the
Howard Beach case pleaded guilty to felony riot charges today
before jury selection resumed in the second trial stemming from the
alleged racial attack.
   Salvatore DeSimone, 20, also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge of criminal facilitation for driving members of a white gang
on Dec. 20, 1986. DeSimone entered his plea before state Supreme
Court Justice Thomas Demakos, who released transcripts today
involving the guilty plea of another defendant.
   DeSimone's attorney, Augustus Agate, said that as part of the
plea, his client will not be required to testify against the other
defendants in the case. He also said DeSimone would receive
youthful offender status and avoid a jail term at his June 27
sentencing.
   During his plea, DeSimone contradicted statements attributed to
him in a police report about the incident, which left 23-year-old
Michael Griffith dead after he was struck and killed by a car on a
nearby highway.
   DeSimone left the courthouse without comment.

   The Senate's Democratic and Republican leaders
said they would move today to limit debate on the superpower
medium-range nuclear missile treaty and predicted it could be
approved before President Reagan meets with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev next week.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he would offer
a cloture motion today to cut short the long series of amendments
being offered by a small band of conservatives who oppose the pact.
   ``It is conceivable that we could finish the work on the treaty
by Friday or Saturday,'' Byrd said outside the White House after a
bipartisan leadership meeting with Reagan. ``The chances now are
pretty good,'' he added. ``There's no reason why we should have
continued delay for the sake of delay.''
   Byrd's Republican counterpart, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, said he
supported the move to cut debate, and quipped that perhaps the way
to do so would be to have Reagan ``take Jesse with him'' to Moscow,
a reference to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the leading treaty
opponent.
   Reagan ``said he'd have to ride on the wing,'' Dole cracked,
``and somebody else said the right wing.''
   Helms and another opponent of the accord, Sen. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., showed no signs of backing off from offering a long series
of amendments to the treaty, despite an appeal on Monday from
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   ``I am at pains to understand why this administration, which is
my administration, has become such a bunch of nervous nellies when
it comes to going back to Gorbachev to work out obvious defects in
this treaty,'' Helms said.
   ``I don't care whether we offend him or not. Let's get it right
the first time.'' Speaking of Reagan, he added: ``I think he's
wrong on this treaty, I think he's been misled. ... My conscience
will not allow me not to pursue the obvious defects of this
treaty.''
   Shultz went to Capitol Hill to deliver the message that the
Moscow summit, which starts in just five days, will be diminished
if Reagan is deprived of the vote of confidence that positive
Senate action on the treaty would give him.
   ``There is a time to inquire and there is also a time to vote,''
Shultz told reporters after a meeting with 17 Republican senators.
``It would be a good thing to have it.''
   Helms was invited to the Shultz session but did not show up. And
when Dole asked Helms how many amendments he would offer to the
treaty, Helms declined to say.
   Three amendments offered by treaty opponents were defeated on
Monday, bringing to nine the number of attempts to change the
document's language that have been beaten back by the Senate since
it was brought up for consideration a week ago.
   First, the lawmakers voted 81-13 to kill a Helms amendment that
would have required the president to certify as accurate a Soviet
report on the number of triple-warhead SS-20 missiles to be
destroyed before the treaty could take effect.
   The Senate then voted 68-26 against an amendment by Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., that would have required a change in the treaty's
text to eliminate what he said was a loophole that would have
permitted construction of some Soviet missiles.
   And it rejected, 81-5, an amendment by Sen. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., that would have put the INF treaty on hold until the United
States and the Soviet Union agreed on a more far-reaching pact
providing 50 percent cuts in each side's arsenals of
intercontinental atomic weapons.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said the issues raised by treaty
opponents ``have been raised and resolved'' during long
consideration by the Senate committees on Foreign Relations, Armed
Services and Intelligence.
   ``It's legitimate to raise them for public debate again, but
it's necessary to resolve them,'' Cohen said. He said Shultz had
warned that failure of the Senate to act would ``diminish the
luster'' of the summit and saddle Reagan with the image of a
president who ``can't deliver the Senate'' on matters he believes
strongly in.
   ``It's important for the president to have that kind of visible,
tangible support going to meet the head of the Soviet Union,'' he
said.
   Ratification, which requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate,
ultimately appears assured. But conservatives have sought to bring
attention to issues like the imbalance in U.S. and Soviet
conventional forces in Europe and the problems of verifying Soviet
compliance with the pact.
   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Gorbachev, requires
destruction within three years of all atomic missiles with ranges
between 300 miles and 3,400 miles. For the Soviets, that includes
400 deployed SS-20s and another 250 stockpiled SS-20s.
   The Helms amendment defeated Monday focused on the number of
SS-20s reported by the Soviets. During debate, Helms maintained
that U.S. intelligence officials are divided on whether that number
is accurate, and cited estimates that there are as many as twice
the reported number.
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said Reagan administration
officials have rejected Helms' claim, although Lugar conceded it is
difficult to prove that no SS-20s are hidden.
   ``It is akin to proving the Loch Ness monster doesn't exist,''
Lugar said.
   Among issues remaining to be settled is an amendment, backed by
the Senate's Democratic majority, which would require Senate
approval before any future administration could change how the
United States interprets the INF pact. The amendment stems from a
fight between Reagan and Democrats over the U.S. interpretation of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile pact, the last U.S.-Soviet arms
agreement approved by the Senate.

<HEAD>House Republicans Say Bush Noriega Position Good</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican House members gave broad support
today to Vice President George Bush's quiet break with President
Reagan on the question of whether to negotiate with Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The House Republican Conference, in a closed session with top
Bush campaign aides, also discussed recent national polls showing
the vice president trailing Gov. Michael Dukakis, his likely
Democratic opponent in the fall presidential election.
   Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois, vice chairman of the conference,
said that ``almost to a person'' the GOP House members ``said they
were pleased about the separation on Noriega.''
   Bush indicated through aides last weekend that he opposed
negotiating with Noriega. The administration is trying to get the
Panamanian general to relinquish power and reportedly has offered
to drop drug charges against him as part of a deal.
   As for the polls showing Dukakis leading Bush, Martin said,
``There wasn't anybody up screaming, `My God, we've got the
Titanic.''' But she did say, ``The seas are rough.''
   Robert Teeter, pollster for the Bush campaign, said current
polls ``have him behind.''
   However, he said he told the House members ``we're in a very
artificial period, that period when Dukakis has been rolling along.
What you've got to do is get past this California primary before
people begin to focus on it.''
   ``We have bad polls,'' said Martin. ``If this were October, we'd
be suicidal. But this is May.''
   Martin said much of the discussion concerned ``how do we get the
George Bush we know apparent to the American people.''
   She said that because Dukakis was in a race against Jesse
Jackson ``he's been allowed to be defined as a moderate.''

<HEAD>Reagan's Trip to Finland: Rest But No Santa Claus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's decision to stop in Finland
for three days before the Moscow summit sent his hosts scurrying
for ways to entertain him in grand style. They even promised him an
audience with Santa Claus.
   St. Nick lives in Rovaniemi, a snowy town snuggled against the
Arctic Circle in Finnish Lapland, according to Finland's tourist
board and the local postmen who received 354,136 letters addressed
to Santa in 1987.
   When Finnish Prime Minister Harri Holkeri visited the White
House recently, he proposed a meeting between Reagan and Santa
during the president's three-night stopover in Helsinki.
   But there's no Finnish Santa Claus on Reagan's schedule.
   Instead, Reagan's sojurn in Helsinki, beginning early Thursday,
will become one of those predominantly private study, rest and
jet-lag recovery stops that have become a pre-summit tradition of
the 77-year-old chief executive.
   Except for a brief visit with Finnish government leaders and a
single speech, Reagan will be nestled in a government guest house
with his briefing books and advisers, boning up on strategy for his
May 29-June 2 talks with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Moscow.
   The Finns had hoped to provide a showy round of events for
Reagan, the first president to visit Finland since Gerald R. Ford
traveled to Helsinki in 1975 to sign a European security and human
rights accord.
   However, keeping a low profile is something the Finns can relate
to.
   ``They're hard to find among the birch trees up there and they
like it that way,'' a U.S. official said.
   For more than four decades, Finland has managed through
soft-spokenness, compromise and neutrality to share a border almost
800 miles long with the Soviet Union and remain an independent,
prosperous and democratic nation.
   In the late 1940s, when Moscow _ to use Cold War rhetoric _
gobbled up Eastern Europe, Finnish leaders made clear they would
fight overt aggression as they had resisted Soviet attack in the
Winter War of 1939-40.
   At the same time, they assured Stalin they would remain outside
the Western sphere of influence and accommodate Soviet interests _
a bargain that preserved Finnish autonomy but gave Finland a
reputation in the United States as a subject nation, an object of
pity.
   ``It is commonplace to believe that Finns live on the razor's
edge, at the mercy of their powerful neighbor,'' former
high-ranking Finnish diplomat Max Jakobson wrote in his 1985 book
``Finland: Myth and Reality.''
   It seems bizarre in Western eyes, he wrote, that Finland could
be a neutral country yet remain faithful to a pact that envisages
military cooperation with the Soviet Union. It seems weird that a
Scandinavian democracy could live ``in apparent harmony with its
communist neighbor.''
   ``This looks to some foreign observers like the Indian rope
trick: a clever thing to do but not quite believable,'' Jakobson
said.
   Commercial policy provides an example of how it works. Finland
has a free, open and prosperous economy, but it has an agreement
with the Soviet Union to keep trade at a balanced level. It runs
its commerce with the Soviets through a state trading company, a
practice no other Western country follows.
   Coincidentally, the $2 billion a year in Finnish-U.S. trade is
roughly balanced as well.
   The even-handed policy seems to include high-level visits and
celebrations of anniversaries. Reagan will be in Finland this week,
while Gorbachev is coming in the fall.
   The Finns and the Russians are celebrating the 40th anniversary
of their Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance
this year. The United States and Finland are commemorating the
350th anniversary of the arrival in America of the first Finns, who
landed with other Scandinavians in what is now Wilmington, Del.
   Even then, the Finns were keeping a low profile. The colony was
called New Sweden.

   About half of the jury pool for former
Gov. Evan Mecham's criminal trial was being questioned today after
48 prospective jurors were eliminated for showing signs of bias.
   Of the original 99 people, 51 remained as efforts continued in
Maricopa County Superior Court to empanel eight jurors and four
alternates. Mecham and his brother, Willard, are charged with
failing to report a $350,000 campaign loan.
   All 99 had filled out long questionnaires last week aimed at
ferreting out those with obvious bias. The prosecution, defense and
judge reviewed the forms.
   Twenty-three of those dropped from the pool had signed Mecham
recall petitions. Others said they were friends of the Mecham
brothers.
   Mecham is charged with six counts of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents; he faces up to 22 years in
prison if convicted. Willard Mecham, his brother's 1986 campaign
treasurer, faces three similar counts and up to 9{ years in prison
if convicted.
   Prosecutor Michael Cudahy and co-prosecutor Barnett Lotstein
asked that the recall petition signers be eliminated from the pool
_ a motion Judge Michael Ryan ``reluctantly'' granted because he
said he doubted that signing a recall petition was directly related
to the criminal charges.
   One person struck from the panel had written, ``Everything I
know about the last 18 months biases me against the Mechams.''
   Another wrote, ``I don't like Evan Mecham.''
   Other prospective jurors struck from the panel wrote that they
believed Mecham was railroaded.

<HEAD>World's Navies Now Have More Than 16,000 Nuclear Warheads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union remain
locked in a nuclear arms race at sea that has pushed the number of
naval nuclear warheads to more than 16,000 worldwide, according to
a private study released Tuesday.
   While the navies of England, France and China also are
``nuclearized,'' possessing a combined 642 nuclear warheads, it is
the two superpowers which are responsible for the large warhead
count, the study said.
   As of last December, the United States had 9,277 nuclear
warheads assigned to its Navy, while the Soviet Union had 6,152 for
its fleet. Of those superpower totals, 6,350 of the warheads are
short-range, ``non-strategic'' weapons that are not covered by any
type of arms control treaty, the study found.
   The study, ``Nuclear Warships and Naval Nuclear Weapons: A
Complete Inventory,'' was published by the Institute for Policy
Studies and the environmental group Greenpeace.
   It was authored by William M. Arkin, the director of the
national security program at the institute, and a research
associate, Joshua Handler. The institute is a liberal think tank
based in Washington that frequently has criticized the
administration's military policies.
   The study lists the individual ships in the five navies that
have been certified to carry or fire nuclear weapons, and Arkin
predicted it could accelerate international debate about allowing
nuclear-armed ships to make port calls.
   The 95-page report, by providing such specific information, also
attacks the official U.S. Navy policy of never confirming or
denying the presence of nuclear weapons, Arkin said.
   ``The Navy argument that the policy bolsters deterrence is just
baloney'' because the ships certified to carry nuclear weapons can
be identified, Arkin said.
   ``I don't think many people have any idea that here are 16,000
nuclear warheads at sea _ one-quarter to one-third of the total in
the world,'' he continued.
   ``But the naval proliferation (of nuclear weapons) is becoming a
matter of concern to foreign governments. And I believe there is a
growing interest and sense that controls are needed for naval
nuclear weapons,'' Arkin said.
   According to the report, the five navies currently deploy 14
types of long-range ballistic missiles on 17 types of submarines.
That combined arsenal of strategic weaponry now totals 1,792
missiles with 9,487 warheads.
   On the non-strategic, or short-range, side, the largest single
category of nuclear weaponry is deployed for anti-submarine
warfare. According to Arkin, there are now 3,300 such ASW weapons
in the fleets of the United States, Soviet Union and Britain.
   Short-range nuclear weapons also have been deployed for use
against enemy aircraft, other ships and targets on land, the study
said. The United States and Soviet Union so far have deployed a
combined 548 nuclear warheads on sea-launched cruise missiles and
another 541 warheads on anti-aircraft missiles.
   ``The nuclear arms race at sea is long-standing, and
accelerating,'' the study concluded. ``As of the end of 1987, 1,101
ships and submarines and over 3,250 aircraft (could) fire,
transport or service one or more of these nuclear weapons.
   ``And all of the nuclear powers have on-going nuclear research
and development programs and are producing new naval nuclear
weapons, as well as the ships, aircraft and missiles that carry or
launch nuclear warheads.''

   Vice President George Bush got a bit of support from
congressional Republicans today and prepared to add Idaho's 18
delegates to his victory total on the way to the GOP presidential
nomination. Michael Dukakis was expected to beat Jesse Jackson in
Idaho's non-binding Democratic primary.
   Officials in Idaho said a low turnout was likely in the polling
today.
   Dukakis was tending to gubernatorial tasks in Massachusetts
today, and traveling to Virginia for an evening appearance. Bush
was in Washington, preparing to see President Reagan off later this
week for next week's superpower summit in Moscow.
   On Capitol Hill, the House Republican Conference met with Bush
campaign aides in a closed session during which they discussed such
matters as Bush's standing in the polls and his stance on the
administration's negotiations with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois, vice chairman of the conference,
said the GOP House members ``said they were pleased about the
separation on Noriega.''
   Bush indicated through aides last weekend that he opposed
negotiating with Noriega. The administration, trying to get Noriega
to relinquish power, reportedly has offered to drop drug charges
against him as part of a deal.
   As for the polls showing Dukakis leading Bush, Martin said,
``There wasn't anybody up screaming, `My God, we've got the
Titanic.''' But she did say, ``The seas are rough.''
   Jackson, campaigning again today in California, released a
budget plan on Monday that would raise taxes on the rich, freeze
defense spending and boost support for social programs.
   The five-year proposal would hike taxes on the wealthy by $244
billion and on corporations by $104 billion. It would cut the
defense budget by $164 billion by freezing projected spending
hikes, and would increase spending on social programs by $344
billion.
   Jackson said his plan would cut the nation's deficit from a
projected $134 billion in 1993 to $49 billion.
   Dukakis did not take issue with the specifics of Jackson's
spending plan, but said his own experience as governor had taught
him that budgets cannot be mapped out in such detail years ahead of
time.
   ``There's no way you can prepare a budget today for 1989,'' said
Dukakis, who is struggling to cope with changing revenue
projections at home in Massachusetts. The governor also brushed
aside Jackson's criticism of his own economic proposals as
``radically conservative.''
   ``It does represent a fundamental change,'' Dukakis said of his
spending policy, which has been expressed in much more general
terms than Jackson's.
   Dukakis' comments came during a quick visit Monday night to New
Jersey, which holds its primary on June 7, the same day as
California. New Mexico and Montana also hold primaries that day.
   Jackson has been stumping hard in California, whose
season-closing contest offers him a last chance to demonstrate his
clout as the Democratic party prepares for its convention,
beginning July 18 in Atlanta.
   Dukakis expects the contests of June 7 will lock in the number
of delegates he needs for the nomination.
   The Massachusetts governor has been raking in delegates nearly
four times as fast as Jackson in the last month. In the past 30
days, Dukakis has claimed 590 delegates to Jackson's 147.
   All told, Dukakis has 1,665 delegates to Jackson's 983,
according to the latest AP delegate count.
   Jackson is tacitly acknowledging his chances of capturing the
nomination are now practically nil. But with moves like the release
of his budget plan, he is working to ensure that his ideas have an
impact on the Democratic platform and that his voice is heard in
Atlanta.
   Jackson, who generally gets a friendly reception from workers,
drew a hostile response when he told workers at the Rancho Seco
nuclear power plant outside Sacramento on Monday that the nuclear
power industry is a ``dangerous job option.''
   The Rancho Seco plant is the target of a voter referendum
seeking to shut it down permanently. The workers booed when Jackson
brought up the dangers of nuclear power.
   Jackson also visited a child-care center on Monday, and recalled
his own early years as the child of an unmarried teen-age mother.
She later married a man who legally adopted Jackson.
   Dukakis, too, visited a child-care center. He told about 50
parents at the Cranford Child Care Center in New Jersey, some of
them with toddlers in tow, that the government must work with
businesses and labor unions to make child care affordable.
   The governor pointed to such a program in his home state, saying
it has proved to companies that ``good child care is good
business.''

   New Jersey officials today began legal
action to take control of the troubled Jersey City schools system,
saying local administrators have repeatedly failed to improve
education for the district's 32,000 students.
   The state's action could result in the biggest seizure of its
kind in the nation.
   Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman based his decision on an
independent auditor's report that is heavily critical of the local
board of education, district administrators and school principals.
   ``Political patronage, union pressure and cronyism is a
consistent motivation, at all levels, in the hiring, firing and
promoting of staff,'' Cooperman said in an order in which he
formally notified the district of his takeover plans.
   Leslie Silberman, a spokeswoman for the Jersey City Board of
Education, said the panel would not comment on Cooperman's
recommendation until they had time to read the report.
   ``During the (investigation), the department found an
overwhelming failure of the school system. We have documented
example after example of the Jersey City school district's chronic
failure,'' said Assistant Commissioner Walter J. McCarroll.
   Cooperman signed an order Monday requiring the district to
accept the decision within 10 days or respond with reasons why it
should not be taken over.
   If a state takeover is achieved, Cooperman would be empowered to
fire Jersey City schools Superintendent Franklin Williams, top
administrators and the entire board of education, which is
appointed by the mayor.
   The report also said the individual schools in the industrial
city are disorganized and mismanaged.
   The department has gone to court to seek an emergency order that
will give it veto power over personnel and fiscal matters in the
district, Cooperman said. McCarroll said the action was taken
Monday in an effort to maintain the ``status quo'' while the
takeover dispute is resolved.
   A hearing on the state's request is scheduled for June 7.
   Cooperman began a nationwide search several weeks ago for a
superintendent the state can appoint to oversee the district in the
event of a takeover.
   The National Governors Association said a takeover in Jersey
City would be the first time a state took control of such a large
urban system, New Jersey's third-largest.
   Mayor Anthony Cucci will not fight a takeover, aide Robert Ricci
said.
   ``The mayor is saying, `Here are the keys, come on in,''' Ricci
said.
   ``I think any change will be good,'' said Linda Smith, a math
teacher. But she said there were no guarantees even with state
control.
   ``You look at this place and everything is falling apart,'' says
Denise Perez, a senior at Lincoln High School. ``There's grafitti
all over the walls, security guards in the halls. It doesn't make
you very enthusiastic about coming to school.''
   The takeover law, enacted five months ago, gives New Jersey
officials some of the broadest powers in the nation to take control
of troubled districts.
   The state can fire the local board of education, superintendent
and top administrators and appoint someone to operate the district
for at least five years.
   Under the law, troubled districts are given three chances to
improve. But Jersey City was not given a third chance because state
officials said city officials either were unwilling or incapable of
making improvements.
   Educators locally and on a state level have urged the state to
step in.
   Williams would be the first person replaced by the state and has
vowed to fight a takeover. Williams, who declined request for
interviews, has said his district has been unfairly singled out.
   He noted that a third of his district's students come from
single-parent families and hundreds more live in homeless shelters.
Many students come from homes in which English is not the primary
language.
   He has recommended more state funding.
   Kentucky, South Carolina, Texas and New Mexico have laws
allowing state takeovers of failing school districts. Laws in
Illinois and Arkansas let the state eliminate deficient districts,
an Ohio law allows the state to revoke a troubled district's
charter and Georgia officials may impose heavy financial penalties
on such districts.

   A Panamanian opposition leader said today the
deal being negotiated by the Reagan administration for a political
settlement in Panama would be turned down by forces opposed to
ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   If a deal is approved by President Reagan and Noriega, forces
opposed to the military chieftain ``will reject the deal. There
will be no peace in Panama; the turmoil will continue,'' Ambassador
Juan B. Sosa said.
   The ambassador, who continues to occupy his nation's embassy
despite being fired by Noriega, said the deal under negotiation
between U.S. and Panamanian negotiators does not call for a
revamping of the Panamanian Defense Forces, thus enabling the
``criminal empire'' Noriega has created within that institution to
wield power even if he departs the country.
   Sosa confirmed many of the previously reported details of the
proposed agreement. He said Noriega would resign as commander of
the Defense Forces in August, then leave the country for an
extended period while preparations are made for elections in May
1989.
   Sosa criticized the administration for negotiating subjects with
Noriega that go well beyond bi-lateral issues.
   He said it is improper for U.S. negotiators to discuss Panama's
political future.
   Under the plan now under negotiation, Panamanian President
Manuel Solis Palma would continue on chief of state while the
United States would recognize ousted President Eric Arturo
Delvalle, Sosa said.
   He said the plan would not guarantee free elections in 1989 nor
would it ensure an end to the ``systematic corruption'' that
currently exists.
   ``No deal is better than a bad deal,'' he said.
   In a statement issued Monday from hiding, Delvalle and his
allies said the negotiations with Noriega, as reported in the
media, ``would mortgage the future of Panama for a long time to
come.''
   The statement was issued through the pro-Delvalle Panamanian
Embassy in Washington by Delvalle and Panama's ``democratic
forces.''
   The administation's chief Panama negotiator, Michael G. Kozak,
was ordered back to Panama late Sunday by the White House to
continue negotiations with Noriega even though Vice President
George Bush has counseled against any dealings with drug dealers,
whether foreign or domestic.
   Delvalle was forced out of office after he tried to fire Noriega
as head of the Panamanian Defense Forces. Delvalle continues to
receive U.S. backing as the legitimate president of Panama, but the
statement indicated he believes the administration has made too
many concessions in its negotiations with Noriega.
   It said Noriega would be able to to continue to exercise
authority even after resigning as defense chief unless the Defense
Forces are revamped.
   U.S. officials who have described the negotiating process have
not suggested that a major overhaul of the Defense Forces is
contemplated.
   The embassy statement also demanded the ``immediate exit'' of
Noriega from Panama, suggesting unhappiness with the August
departure date now planned.
   The U.S. officials have said that, as foreseen in the
negotiations, Noriega would leave Panama in August and return after
the May 1989 presidential elections. They said Noriega would have a
hand in the selection of an interim government which would serve
until after the elected government takes office.
   The embassy statement called for Delvalle's reinstatment as
president and for the formation of a government of national
reconciliation.
   Noriega, the de facto Panamanian ruler who is under
drug-smuggling indictments in the United States, has successfully
resisted prolonged U.S. pressure to force him out.
   There is a sharp division within the administration over what
kind of deal Noriega should be offered, and particularly whether
the government should go ahead with an offer to drop the drug
charges.
   Reagan said nothing had been settled and that there was not a
timetable for concluding a deal. But Under Secretary of State
Michael Armacost said it would be desirable to reach a settlement
before Reagan's departure for Finland on Wednesday. He is due in
Moscow on Sunday.
   Reagan, asked whether he was prepared to drop the drug charges
against the Panamanian general, said, ``Nothing's been settled.
It's still in the works.''
   Kozak, the deputy assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, spent the weekend in Washington after
nearly a month of negotiations in Panama. Kozak briefed Reagan and
other high-level officials and returned to Panama Monday morning.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Kozak ``is
prepared to continue discussions.''

   Fighters loyal to Iran assaulted the last
pocket held by pro-Syrian militiamen in the Shiite Moslem slums
Tuesday, increasing pressure on Syria's army to move in and stop
the 19-day-old war.
   Police said 17 people were killed and 49 wounded in
house-to-house fighting in south Beirut, a warren of narrow alleys,
tin-roofed huts and concrete-block apartments that covers 16 square
miles next to the Beirut airport.
   That raised the casualty toll kept by police to 296 killed and
1,000 wounded since fighting began May 6 between Hezbollah, the
radical group allied with Iran, and the mainline Amal militia
supported by Syria.
   In Christian east Beirut, the right-wing Phalange of President
Amin Gemayel and the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia,
clashed during the night. The militias are rivals for control of
the capital's Christian sector.
   Police said the fight started after Lebanese Forces gunmen
wounded Nabil Kahhaleh, Phalange commander in the Sin el-Fil
district. Police said one person was killed and four were wounded.
   Hezbollah, whose name means Party of God, controls 95 percent of
south Beirut, where most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon
are believed held by Shiite factions linked to the militia. Nine
Americans are among the captives.
   A police spokesman said Hezbollah fighters ``stormed through
Amal positions'' in the Ghobeiry neighborhood behind a fierce
howitzer and mortar barrage.
   He said Amal withdrew into the Shiyah district on the northern
edge of the slums. ``Hezbollah now controls the southern and
western flanks of Shiyah and its gunners are pounding Amal's supply
lines on the northern edge,'' said the spokesman, whose name cannot
be used because of regulations.
   Syria's soldiers patrol west Beirut and it has 25,000 men
stationed in eastern and northern Lebanon.
   It deployed 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored vehicles on
the southern, western and northern edges of the slums May 15 after
Hezbollah had seized most of the slums.
   Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who is Lebanon's acting prime
minister, has urged Syria to act ``without delay'' to end the
fighting.
   Amal conceded defeat in Ghobeiry and claimed Palestinian
guerrillas from Fatah, the main army of Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization, were helping Hezbollah.
   The PLO controls Bourj el-Barajneh, a refugee enclave in the
Shiite slums.
   An Amal statement said: ``Hezbollah has managed to achieve some
gains in Ghobeiry.''
   It said the Hezbollah assault was coordinated by senior officers
of the militia and Fatah, and Iranian Revolutionary Guards sent
from their base in eastern Lebanon. Fatah denied helping Hezbollah.
   T-54 tanks and truck-mounted rocket launchers manned by Amal
fighters poured fire from Shiyah into Hezbollah territory.
   No clear word on the fate of the hostages has emerged since the
fight for the Shiite slums began.
   Ad-Diyar, a Christian daily newspaper, said two American
captives were being held at the Iranian Embassy in Moslem west
Beirut. The report did not identify the hosages and could not be
verified independently.
   Last week, Iranian officials denied reports that some hostages
were held in the basement of the embassy.
   The report in Ad-Diyar said Hezbollah ``brought a doctor from
west Beirut to the southern suburbs to check on a hostage who is
suffering from a lung disease.'' It did not elaborate.
   A statement Tuesday purporting to be from the pro-Iranian
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, said the captives would be
killed unless their governments opened direct negotiations with the
kidnappers. There was no way to verify the authenticity of the
statement issued in the Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon.
   Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the hostage held longest. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   Fighting in the slums instensified Monday after Syria rejected
an Iranian proposal for a joint peace-keeping force in the slums.
   Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud, chief of Syrian military intelligence in
Beirut, said the Iranian proposal was ``out of the question.''
   President Hafez Assad of Syria is the main power broker in
Lebanon after 13 years of civil war, and Iran's main Arab ally in
its 7{-year-old war with Iraq.
   Despite their alliance, Syria and Iran are involved in a
struggle through surrogates for influence with the 1.2 million
Shiites, the largest sect in Lebanon.

   State police today arrested a man
suspected of fatally shooting a hiker and wounding her companion,
culminating a two-day manhunt over rough mountainous terrain.
   About 50 police officers using dogs, horses and helicopters
began their search Monday morning for Stephen Roy Carr, 29, who
police believe lives in the mountains of the Cleversburg area at
the edge of the Michaux State Forest.
   Phil Carey of the Pennsylvania State Police said he did not know
where or when Carr had been arrested or whether he had been charged
in the case.
   State police, who had resumed their search this morning, planned
a news conference this afternoon in Harrisburg, Carey said.
   Sgt. John Straka of the state police in Gettysburg said Carr
matches the description by the surviving woman of a man the two
women had met earlier May 13, when the shooting occurred.
   ``We just want to talk to Mr. Carr,'' Straka said earlier. ``He
is considered a suspect and may be armed and dangerous. We know
that he has no fixed place of abode and that he does wander the
mountain area.''
   Cleversburg lies southwest of Harrisburg and northwest of
Gettysburg in southcentral Pennsylvania. It is about 4{ miles from
the shooting site _ a remote part of the state forest.
   Rebecca Wight, 29, of Blacksburg, Va., was shot and killed and
Claudia Brenner, 31, of Ithaca, N.Y., was shot in the face while
the two were camping in the state forest after a day of hiking the
Appalachian Trail.
   Ms. Brenner managed to walk about three miles to a road after
the shooting. She has been transferred from the Milton S. Hershey
Medical Center to another hospital for security reasons. She was in
stable condition, Straka said.

<HEAD>Official Says Italy to Take U.S. Air Wing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO ministers meeting later this week in
Europe are expected to formally ask Italy to accept 72 U.S. Air
Force jet fighters being evicted from Spain, the Pentagon's No. 2
official said Tuesday.
   Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV told the House Armed
Services Committee he expects Italy will then agree to be host to
the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing.
   Defense ministers of the 16 North Atlantic Treaty Organization
nations meeting Thursday and Friday in Brussels will probably
approve the funds needed for the relocation of the F-16 planes, he
said.
   Italy had expressed willingness to deploy the wing after the
Spanish government, bowing to internal political pressure, asked
for its removal late last year. But the Italians insisted that NATO
make a formal request and finance the move, expected to cost some
$500 million.
   One of the sites under discussion for the new deployment is the
Italian air force base at Goia Delle Colle on the Adriatic coast of
southern Italy, a defense official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
American presence in the impoverished region may be ``easy to sell
to the Italian public'' because of the economic advantages it would
bring.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci had given NATO until August to
reach a decision about the 401st, saying that otherwise he would
order the wing and its estimated 5,000 personnel sent back home and
deactivated.
   Carlucci, who will attend the Brussels meeting en route to the
superpower summit in Moscow, is then scheduled to visit South Korea
and Japan.
   Taft said Carlucci ``has every confidence that (Korean)
officials will be prepared to respond with specific increased
funding levels for their programs at that time.''
   Taft did not say what aid the United States is expecting beyond
the $100 million in direct contributions South Korea gives annually
to support the 43,000 American troops on the Korean peninsula.
   Privately U.S. officials say that while they have not asked
South Korea for specific sums, they expect an offer of no more than
$60 million annually. The officials point out that South Korea
contributes more than $1 billion to the U.S. presence annually in
indirect costs such as real estate and personnel.
   Taft said that on a visit to South Korea earlier this month he
`'suggested they increase their contribution in support of our
common defense efforts against North Korea as well as the growing
Soviet regional presence.''
   The United States has been urging such Asian countries as South
Korea and Japan to increase their defense spending in the face of
their successful economic performance and the decline in the U.S.
spending allowance.
   Taft said he was ``very encouraged'' by Japan's reaction to his
pitch when he stopped in Tokyo earlier this month. He said he would
visit there again this fall following Carlucci's trip, ``and I hope
we'll have something very good to tell you.''
   Taft said NATO, of which Japan is not a member, had reacted with
``extraordinary speed'' in setting up a panel to review each
country's contribution to the alliance. The defense ministers in
Brussels will probably vote to submit a report on the review in
December, he said.
   The NATO review board was set up in response to growing
sentiment in Congress that alliance members whose economies are
improving should carry more of the defense burden and stop relying
on the United States to make up the shortfall.

<HEAD>Controversy Over Bug-Riddled US Embassy In Moscow Unresolved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The controversy over the bug-riddled new U.S.
Embassy and repercussions over the spying scandal at the old
complex continue as President Reagan prepares to visit the Soviet
capital for his fourth summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But officials say Reagan is unlikely to broach the subject at
the summit.
   ``I don't see an issue that needs to come up on the embassy
right now,'' said Robert E. Lamb, assistant secretary of state for
diplomatic security.
   ``We have talked to the Russians and have told them ... they
have an obligation to let us get a secure embassy where we can do
our business in Moscow,'' he said in an interview.
   But Rep. Dan Mica, D-Fla., chairman of a House subcommittee on
international operations and a past critic of security in Moscow,
said Reagan should seize the opportunity to talk about the
``embassy bugging and the cost of replacing the building.''
   Two separate events came to a head and attracted widespread
public and congressional attention in the spring of 1987.
   The first involved the existing embassy, which the United States
acquired in 1952. Sensational allegations were aired that Marine
guards had allowed KGB agents to roam the secure areas of the
building.
   Following those reports, a presidential panel, headed by former
Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird, concluded that conditions at the
embassy were ``seedy and disgraceful.'' Security breaches easily
could have occurred in the building, the panel said.
   Over the past year, Lamb said the ``vulnerabilities'' in the
building have been corrected. ``There were some holes and we have
moved to fill them.''
   Besides upgrading counterintelligence at the embassy,
technicians swept the area for bugs and removed electronic
equipment like typewriters and computers. Upgrading the embassy
cost about $50 million, Mica said.
   Lamb also said some of the reports of spying at the embassy have
proven to be false.
   ``There is no evidence that Marines allowed the Soviets into the
embassy,'' he said. One embassy guard, Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree,
was convicted of espionage for giving the KGB the identities of CIA
agents and the floor plans to the U.S. embassies in Moscow and
Vienna.
   But charges that Lonetree and Cpl. Arnold Bracy permitted KGB
agents to wander through the embassy's secure areas were dropped by
government prosecutors.
   The second concern centers around the bug-riddled new,
eight-story embassy building that was scheduled to be finished next
year. Under a 1972 agreement, the Americans allowed Soviet
construction crews to do work on the building, which is part of a
$191 million complex.
   ``I am deeply concerned over the breach of security in our
Moscow embassy, and while all the facts are not known, it is clear
that security implications are widespread and that additional quick
action is required to prevent further damage to our national
security,'' Reagan said on April 7, 1987.
   ``The United States will not occupy our new embassy building in
Moscow unless and until I can be assurred that it is safe to move
into a secure embassy environment,'' he vowed.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has ordered a study of his
options: tearing the building down, neutralizing it and leaving it
intact or taking off some of the floors. Lamb said the study should
be complete in the fall.
   With Reagan leaving office in January, it is likely his
successor will have to deal with the problem of what to do about
the building.
   While the embassy issue may be played down at the summit,
security will be a priority, Lamb said. The diplomatic security
office and the Secret Service work together to provide security for
the presidential entourage.
   To block the KGB from gaining U.S. secrets, technicians will
ship over special, impenetrable steel rooms akin to huge
refrigerators, officials said. They will also use encryption
equipment so Americans can communicate with Washington.

<HEAD>Opposition Party Blames U.S. For Recent Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main opposition party Tuesday
blamed U.S. interference in domestic affairs and the government's
``humiliating subservience'' to the United States for recent
attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts.
   The Party for Peace and Democracy, led by former presidential
candidate Kim Dae-jung, said recent anti-U.S. protests were caused
in part by attempts to subordinate Korean policy to U.S. interests.
   But the oppositon party called on protesters to halt violent
attacks on U.S. diplomatic offices and said it did not endorse
calls for the removal of American troops from South Korea.
   ``Although we understand the feelings of the students, we
strongly ask them not to use violence under any circumstances,''
the opposition party said in its harshest criticism of the United
States in recent months.
   Students have attacked U.S. diplomatic posts in Seoul and the
southern city of Kwangju since violent protests began Wednesday to
mark the eighth anniversary of a civil uprising in the southern
city of Kwangju.
   The dissidents have called for the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo and the removal of 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea
under a mutual defense pact.
   Protesters hurled firebombs and rocks at the U.S. Information
Service building in Kwangju on Monday and threw home-made bombs at
the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on Friday after an attack on the nearby
U.S. Information Service office the day before.
   On Tuesday, scattered clashes continued in Kwangju, 165 miles
south of Seoul, when riot police fired tear gas to stop some 1,200
students trying to march on two campuses.
   In Seoul, 2,000 students from three universities battled riot
police Tuesday at a university campus, shouting anti-government and
anti-U.S. slogans. There there were no reports of injuries or
arrests.
   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae on Tuesday promised action after the
governing Democratic Justice Party called for tighter security to
protect U.S. diplomatic facilities.
   The government and opposition parties agreed to form special
committees during the National Assembly's first special session in
June to investigate the Kwangju incident and corruption under
former governments.
   But Kim Dae-jung's party urged the government and the United
States to study why anti-U.S. protests were increasing and to take
steps to end repressive rule and other unpopular policies.
   The recent protests, Kim's party said, were caused by ``U.S.
policies that emphasize its own national interests and the (South
Korean) government's humiliating subservience toward the U.S.''
   U.S. officials have consistently denied their government had
anything to do with the nine-day Kwangju uprising, in which about
200 people were killed when the army suppressed the protests.
Dissidents contend the United States condoned the action and that
South Korea covered up the brutality of the soldiers.

   Laos has appointed an ambassador to
China, ending a decade of estrangement between the communist
neighbors.
   The official news agency KPL, monitored in Bangkok, reported
Tuesday that envoy Phoungsavath Boupha received his credential
letter on Monday from the Laotian government. It didn't say when he
would take up his post.
   Although some diplomatic ties remained in place, the two
countries withdrew their ambassadors after Laos' ally, Vietnam,
invaded Cambodia in 1978 and ousted a pro-Chinese government.
   In addition, Laos has accused China of aiding Laotian exiles
fighting to overthrow the Laotian government.
   Relations improved in the past year and a half with meetings
between high-level Laotian and Chinese officials. According to
Laos, China has pledged it would no longer help the exiles.

   Here's the latest bulletin from Tass: The official
Soviet news agency is going into the souvenir T-shirt, button,
record and cassette business, just in time for the summit.
   Tass announced Tuesday night that it has entered into an
agreement with a Washington firm to design, produce and distribute
souvenirs of the May 29-June 2 meetings here between Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and President Reagan.
   Tass Director General Sergei Losev said his agency was venturing
into the souvenir market for the first time, and that it ``makes
good sense for American companies and Soviet organizations to work
together, especially during the planning for such an important
event as the summit.''
   The U.S. partner in the business was identified as Kavulich
International, Inc.
   Tass said the company's chairman, John S. Kavulich II, praised
the joint souvenir operation and said it ``demonstrates the desire
of the Soviet Union to learn more about Western marketing methods.''
   The T-shirts to be produced have a four-color design on the
front, which Tass did not describe, and a new ``Tass Top 20'' logo
on the back to promote a new music rating program the news agency
plans.
   The souvenirs will be sold at Moscow hotels and at ``selected
stores within the United States,'' Tass said.
   Buttons, audio cassettes and record albums also will be
produced, Tass said, without providing details.
   Central planning in the Soviet Union has prevented most
industries from capitalizing on short-term business prospects such
as souvenir sales during events like the summit. But economic
reforms introduced by Gorbachev have allowed more flexibility by
individual enterprises and agencies, and the Tass project is an
outgrowth of those reforms.

the Woods'' was picked as best musical of the 1987-88 New York

music, Andrew Lloyd Webber; orchestrations, Andrew Lloyd Webber and
David Cullen; set design, Maria Bjornson; costume design, Maria
Bjornson; and lighting design, Andrew Bridge.
   Ron Silver was named best actor for his performance as a greedy

Channing was chosen best actress for her portrait of a woman slowly
going mad in Alan Ayckbourn's ``Woman in Mind.''
   ``M. Butterfly,'' written by David Henry Hwang, tells the

the opera star.
   ``Into the Woods,'' an adult fairy tale musical, captured five

Gleason; lyrics, Stephen Sondheim, and book of musical, James

show also won the best revival award as well as a prize for
choreography, which went to Michael Smuin.
   The prize for featured actress in a play went to Christine
Estabrook who played a retarded woman in ``The Boys Next Door,''

<HEAD>Jackson Sets TV Campaign for California</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson will spend between $500,000 and
$750,000 on TV commercials starting next week in California, his
campaign manager said Tuesday.
   Voters in California and three other states wind up the long
Democratic primary season on June 7.
   Jackson's campaign chairman Willie Brown, the California
Assembly speaker, had earlier said that the budget would be more
than $2 million, but campaign manager Gerald Austin said that
figure might encompass the total campaign budget for advertising,
staff and other costs.
   ``I never thought to spend $2 million on TV,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles. But he said the $750,000
estimate may go up ``if some additional money comes in.''
   The Jackson campaign, which has improved its fund-raising to a
$4-million-a-month operation, is paying staff members at offices in
37 of California's 45 congressional districts and thus has other
financial commitments to meet, he said.
   The California commercials will start on May 31, one week before
the election. Austin said it has not been decided whether new ones
will be produced or the campaign will recycle some of the ones it
has used throughout the campaign.
   In New Jersey, which also holds a primary on June 7, along with
California, Montana and New Mexico, there will be no expenditures
for TV, he said, but the campaign is buying some radio time. The
overall campaign budget in New Jersey is about $250,000, Austin
said.
   New Jersey viewers already got a good dose of Jackson ads
because they are in the markets where he aired commericals during
the New York and Pennsylvania primaries, Austin said.

<HEAD>Honduran Ambassador Was `Mule,' Prosecutor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal magistrate ruled Tuesday that the
Honduran ambassador to Panama must remain in jail on cocaine
charges, and a prosecutor said the suspect apparently was a
``mule'' who simply transported the drug.
   Rigoberto Regalado Lara, 49, was arrested May 15 at Miami
International Airport after 26 pounds of cocaine was discovered in
his luggage.
   He was immediately stripped of his diplomatic immunity by
Honduran officials, who said he would also be prosecuted there if
he returned home.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Odilio Diaz said following Tuesday's
hearing before U.S. Magistrate Samuel Smargon that there is no
evidence Regalado was a major player in the drug trade.
   ``Right now, it looks as if all he is is a typical mule who just
happened to be a Honduran ambassador,'' said Diaz. A mule is a
low-level figure who carries the drugs across borders.
   But Regalado's attorney, David Rothman, said his client was
innocent, and he had proof.
   ``There is a witness in Honduras who can provide a reasonable
and innocent explanation'' for the presence of the cocaine, Rothman
said. Regalado will plead innocent, Rothman said.
   He sought unsuccessfully to have his client freed from the
Metropolitan Correctional Center, where Regalado has been held
since his arrest.
   But Diaz called the ambassador ``an extreme risk of flight,''
noting that if Regalado fled to Honduras, he could not be
extradited back to the United States.
   Smargon ordered Regalado to remain in custody without bond, but
said the issue could be raised again at an arraignment hearing
scheduled Tuesday.

<HEAD>Unflappable BBC Newscasters Prevail in Studio Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with a studio invasion by four screaming gay
rights activists, a BBC-TV newscaster coolly delivered the evening
news while her resourceful co-anchor grappled with one of the women
and silenced her off-screen.
   The women, protesting a new law concerning homosexuality, rushed
into the studio shouting, just as the British Broadcasting Corp.'s
``Six O'Clock News'' went on the air Monday night.
   Puzzled viewers, however, heard only a few unintelligible howls
in the background as anchorwoman Sue Lawley unflinchingly proceeded
with the news of the day.
   Off-camera, as the invaders ran around handcuffing themselves to
pieces of equipment, co-anchor Nicholas Witchell saw a woman run
toward Miss Lawley's desk.
   ``I found she had handcuffed herself to Sue's desk so I sat on
her and put my hand over her mouth,'' he said. ``I thought we would
be taken off the air but Sue, very calmly, kept running through the
introduction to the first piece.''
   Miss Lawley asked viewers to ignore what was going on in the
background and, in her usual pleasant tone, said, ``We have rather
been invaded.''
   She closed the show by apologizing to viewers and telling them,
``Our unwelcome guests have now been taken away by the police.''
   Later she said, ``It was a very alarming experience.''
   BBC security men handed the four women over to police, who
released them without charge later Monday.
   British newspapers carried admiring stories of the two cool
newscasters on their front pages and Ron Neil, BBC's deputy
director of news and current affairs, said: ``Presenting the news,
which is live, is the most difficult of tasks in normal conditions.
To carry on through that kind of unnerving and unpredicted invasion
shows a superb level of professionalism.''
   The BBC said Tuesday it would review and change its security
measures at the Television Center studio in West London.
   ``This group used deception to get into the premises and had
carefully planned their demonstration,'' said a BBC spokeswoman.
``An inquiry has taken place and there will be a slight change in
security practices.''
   She did not give any details, but Press Association, the British
domestic news agency, said the women were believed to have bluffed
their way past the security guards by asking for a fictitious name
at the gate.
   Unable to find the person in the building directory, the guard
told them to go to the reception area in the main building, and
they were unchallenged as they went through the building to find
the news studio, the agency said.
   One of the invaders, Rachel Cox, said Monday the group was
trying to draw attention to the controversial Clause 29, which went
into effect at midnight Monday, barring local authorities from
promoting homosexuality, such as through grants to centers for
homosexuals.
   ``This is a further statement of lesbian defiance,'' Ms. Cox
said.
   On Feb. 2, women protesters slid down ropes from the public
gallery onto the floor of the House of Lords during debate on the
bill. And on March 8, five women chained themselves to the gates of
Buckingham Palace to protest the clause.
   The legislation has been criticized by homosexuals and the arts
community as a threat to artistic freedom. Critics claim it could
lead to the censorship of writers who are homosexuals.
   Proponents of the measure say it is intended to prevent local
governments from using taxpayers' money to teach children that
homosexuality is acceptable.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington, with its many memorials to war
heroes, needs a monument to a man of peace, Mohandas K. Gandhi,
Congress was told Tuesday.
   The same message was voiced by a parade of witnesses testifying
in favor of legislation to re-authorize construction of a Gandhi
memorial on government-owned land in the capital.
   Gandhi, India's apostle of non-violence and civil disobedience,
was assassinated in 1948 and Congress authorized a Gandhi memorial
the next year But the authorization expired before the then-small
Indian-American community could raise enough money, said Rep.
Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., author of new legislation co-sponsored
by 74 House members.
   A memorial to Gandhi and his philosophy would be especially
important as an inspiration for the millions of children who visit
Washington, Dymally told a House Administration subcommittee.
   ``At a time when ethnic strife is rampant in many parts of the
world, and nations spend significant amounts of wealth on
amrmaments, the preservation of Gandhi's spirit and message has
become a mandate,'' he said.
   Dymally's bill authorizes construction of the memorial at no
cost to the government by the Indian-American Forum for Political
Education, a non-partisan organization that teaches Americans of
Asian Indian ancestry about their adopted homeland.
   Achamma Chandersekaran, the forum president, noted that Gandhian
thinking is rooted in the writings of American philosophers Ralph
Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. The Indian-Americans want to
``give back to this great country what one of our own borrowed from
here,'' she said.
   The form and location of the proposed monument have not been
decided but Sharat Tak, a local Indian-American computer executive,
has offered to start fund-raising with a $100,000 donation, Mrs.
Chandersekaran said. One proposed location is in a Peace Garden
planned by the National Park Service.
   Gandhi's tactics in the Indian independence movement were used
by the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King, several
speakers noted at the hearing.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top U.S. diplomat has criticized remarks by
Syria's envoy to the United Nations as anti-Semitic and racist.
   In a letter Monday to Edgar Bronfman, president of the World
Jewish Congress, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Williamson
said the ``anti-Semitic statement by the Syrian representative ...
was an unaccaptable use of the (U.N.) Security Council as a
platform for spewing racism.''
   Williamson was referring to a statement by Syrian Ambassador
Fachi al-Masri on May 6 at the U.N. Security Council during a
debate about an Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon.
   Al-Masri said Israel's presence in south Lebanon is aimed at
creating ``a state of psychosis that will compel the inhabitants of
southern Lebanon to abandon their lands and property, thereby ...
giving a free hand to the expansionist policy of the World Jewish
Congress, with Israel as its agent.''
   The WJC, an international organization which defends the rights
of Jews and other minorities, wrote a protest letter to U.N.
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar expressing ``outrage at
this vile expression of anti-Semitism.''
   Williamson assured Bronfman the United States would ``remain
alert to the possibility of such statements in the future and,
where appropriate, will respond accordingly.''
   At last month's U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva,
the WJC demanded that Syria expel Alois Brunner, who was a senior
Nazi officer in World War II and now lives in Damascus.

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After hearing cockfights condemned as a
blood sport and praised as an economic plus for Louisiana, a Senate
committee on Tuesday turned aside legislation to outlaw the
practice.
   By a 2-1 vote, two bills by Sen. Sydney Nelson were deferred by
a judiciary committee. Nelson said he would decide whether to bring
up a bill allowing parishes to ban cockfighting after the House
hears similar legislation.
   ``It took several years to outlaw dogfighting and it may take
several years to outlaw cockfighting, but I think we will
ultimately prevail,'' he said.
   Nelson's legislation would have made cockfighting a misdemeanor
punishable by a fine of up to $500 and a six-month jail sentence.
   Louisiana, New Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma are the only states
that have not banned cockfighting.
   Nelson, who called cockfighting a ``blood sport,'' presented a
petition with more than 2,000 signatures calling for the ban. The
bill also was backed by several sheriffs and police chiefs.
   Animal activists have long condemned cockfighting. Birds that
participate are specially bred and equipped with a razor to inflict
serious or fatal wounds.
   Bob Baker, a field investigator for the Humane Society of the
United States, called cockfighting ``very degrading and
dehumanizing.'' He said breeders often use illegal drugs to make
their birds fight.
   However, a representative of the United Gamefowl Breeders
Association, said cockfighting buffs ``come from all respectable
walks of society'' and have included George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln.
   Bob Guilbeau, a Lafayette restaurant owner, said cockfighting
brings tourists to Louisiana. ``My business enjoys its five busiest
weekends when the Sunset Recreation Club (a cockfighting
establishment) has its meetings,'' he said.

   Ticks in an urban park were the likely culprits
behind four confirmed cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, one
fatal, in New York City last summer, doctors said.
   Usually a hazard of the suburbs and countryside, the fever
apparently was contracted by four New Yorkers near where they lived
in the Bronx, according to Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   ``There are many dangers of life in New York City, but until now
they have not included Rocky Mountain spotted fever,'' Dr. David T.
Durack of Duke University commented in an editorial in the journal.
   A team headed by Dr. Miklos P. Salgo of Albert Einstein College
of Medicine in New York reported tracking down the probable cause _
ticks in the Bronx' Soundview park that carried bacteria
responsible for the fever.
   One victim, a 10-year-old boy, died of the infection.
   The disease can be stopped if treated quickly with antibiotics.
The doctors said physicians should consider Rocky Mountain spotted
fever whenever trying to diagnose unexplainable feverish illnesses,
even if the patients haven't traveled to places where the disease
is common.
   The disease is most frequent in the south Atlantic and south
central states. About 3 percent to 6 percent of recognized cases
are fatal.

   A ranking official said Tuesday the Communist
Party may limit leaders to two five-year terms, ending the
perpetual tenure that cements personal power, but he did not
indicate it would apply to Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``This is a big step in the development of intraparty
democracy,'' said Karl Vayno, party chief for the republic of
Estonia.
   Gorbachev has said he favors restrictions on tenure. Terms for
party leaders now are unlimited and longevity is a tool officials
at the local, retional and nation levels use to build power and
privilege.
   Vayno spoke to reporters during a break in the opening-day
session of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament that
formally adopts party policy.
   Officials announced an agenda focused solely on domestic
affairs, indicating the 1,500-member body would not consider the
U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium- and shorter-range nuclear
weapons.
   A joint meeting Monday of the Foreign Affairs committees of the
parliament's two chambers approved the treaty. The Supreme Soviet's
Presidium has authority to ratify it, but there was no indication
when it would do so.
   Both Gorbachev and President Reagan had hoped for ratification
by the time their Moscow summit begins Sunday, but the U.S. Senate
also has yet to act.
   According to Vayno, a meeting Monday of the party Central
Committee adopted proposals for consideration at by the June 28
party conference, including a limitation on tenure of party
officials.
   He said other items would exclude certain party jobs from the
rule, among them Gorbachev's as national party chief, and it was
uncertain what the conference would decide.
   Asked for his personal view, he said it ``depends on the
personality. If the vote is about Gorbachev, I would vote with both
hands to exclude him.''
   Gorbachev became first secretary in March 1985 and has urged the
Communist Party to find ways of renewing its leadership. He has
railed against the 18-year reign of Leonid I. Brezhnev as a period
of corruption and stagnation.
   Brezhnev held power until his death in 1982. Kremlin leaders
customarily die in office unless they are pushed out in power
plays, like Brezhnev's against Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1964.
   Asked by The Washington Post last week whether he supported
limited terms of office, Gorbachev answered, ``Yes,'' but did not
elaborate.
   Vayno said the Central Committee also agreed the conference
would debate changes in the voting system for positions in the
soviets, or government councils. Asked whether reforms would
include multiple candidates, he said ``Anything is possible.''
   He gave no further information about the conference agenda,
which some officials have described as showdown between Gorbachev's
reformers and conservatives in the party leadership.
   Tatiana Zaslavskaya, a sociologist and party adviser, says
citizen groups advocating new policies could be organized but
formation of rival political parties would be unconstitutional.
   She told reporters Monday she supports the idea of ``social
institutions or peoples unions'' to assist the party.
   The Supreme Soviet and Central Committee meetings illustrate the
differences between the Soviet and Western concepts of democracy.
   About 20 people spoke at the Central Committee meeting, then the
more than 300 committee members adopted the conference agenda
unanimously, Vayno said. In the Supreme Soviet, as usual, all votes
were unanimous.
   Gorbachev and other party and government leaders attended the
parliament session, including Yegor K. Ligachev, No. 2 man in the
Kremlin.
   Ligachev has been linked with a campaign to slow the reform
program Gorbachev calls ``perestroika,'' or restructuring. He and
Gorbachev spent several minutes in conversation during Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's address about a law on cooperatives that is to
be approved Wednesday and take effect July 1.
   The Supreme Soviet removed Boris N. Yeltsin, a former candidate
member of the Politburo, from the Presidium. Yeltsin fell from
power in November after making a speech in to the Central Committee
favoring a more rapid pace of reform than Gorbachev. His seat went
to Lev N. Zaikov, who also had replaced Yeltsin as Moscow party
chief.
   Ryzhkov said the cooperative movement Gorbachev offers as an
alternative to the inefficient state-run economy is of ``immense
social and political significance. In a short time it can solve the
most severe problems of perestroika, the demands of the population
for goods and services.''
   Nearly 6,000 co-ops have been formed in the three months since a
draft of the law was published, compared to 14,000 in the previous
18 months. Ryzhkov said the increased pace indicates the
progressive income tax and guarantees that cooperative property
cannot be seized are viewed favorably.

   A nut is a nut, unless it's a hazelnut, in
which case it's a filbert, and in case you didn't know that, an
industry marketing board is about to spend $200,000 to make it all
perfectly clear.
   That's the Hazelnut Marketing Board, by the way. Which works
hand-in-glove with the Oregon Filbert Commission.
   State filbert growers began using the more popular name hazelnut
in the early 1980s for the round, brown nuts of the European hazel
tree.
   The nuts, whatever you call them, are more popular overseas than
they are here, but Oregon growers want to change all that; hence
their first major hazelnut-filbert marketing program.
   Oregon produces nearly the entire U.S. crop of hazelnuts,
averaging 20,000 tons a year, but it's a piker in a world of nut
behemoths like Spain and Turkey, which help produce half-a-million
tons a year.
   ``Hazelnuts are probably used worldwide more than any other
nut,'' says Robert Gelhar, executive secretary for the filbert
commission. ``We have chocolate bars with almonds. In Europe they'd
more likely be hazelnuts.''
   Gelhar said the promotional campaign is aimed at bakeries, candy
makers and other food processing concerns.
   ``It's a matter of getting people acquainted with hazelnuts,''
Gelhar said.
   Junction City grower Jim Rear said Oregon needs to increase its
production to 200,000 tons annually to compete.
   The program's $200,000 will come from an increase in packer
assessments, and not everyone is happy about it. Some say that the
program was adopted at the wrong time because demand already
exceeds supply.
   ``It's hard to sell more nuts if you don't have them,'' said
Rear.

   Sen. Charles Grassley and Gov. Terry
Branstad have agreed to jointly head George Bush's Iowa campaign in
a move aimed at healing deep rifts in the state's Republican Party.
   Grassley was the most prominent Iowa backer of Senate GOP Leader
Bob Dole and helped him score a victory in the state's precinct
caucuses on Feb. 8. Branstad did not endorse a candidate during
that campaign.
   Bush campaign officials said they plan to announce the
appointments next week at a news conference in Des Moines.
   George Wittgraf, a Cherokee lawyer who headed Bush's caucus
campaign, said Grassley ``will be prominently and actively
involved, together with the governor.''
   Wittgraf will run the day-to-day activities of Bush's fall
campaign in the state. Grassley aides said he will brief Bush on
farm and defense issues, campaign for him in Iowa and other farm
states, as well as serving as his honorary Iowa co-chairman.

<HEAD>Orders For Durable Goods Up For Third Straight Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to the nation's factories for ``big
ticket'' durable goods increased for the third consecutive month in
April, the government said Tuesday in another report indicating
strong demand for U.S. exports.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, rose 0.8 percent last month
to a seasonally adjusted $116.3 billion. The climb followed gains
of 0.9 percent in March and 0.1 percent in February.
   Orders in April were 8.5 percent greater than a year earlier.
   ``It's a moderate increase. It clearly shows that export orders
are very strong,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the WEFA
group, a Philadelphia-area forecasting firm.
   The Commerce Department last week reported that U.S. exports
surged 23 percent in March to a record $29 billion, with much of
the strength coming in machinery, aircraft and computers.
   The declining value of the dollar, which is less than half of
what it was three years ago when measured against the Japanese yen,
is bolstering sales of U.S. goods overseas by making them cheaper
when compared to foreign goods.
   Chimerine and David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &
Co., a government securities dealer in New York, said the cheaper
dollar also is helping U.S. manufacturers in another way by
boosting the cost of imported goods in the United States.
   ``There are some hints that consumers are beginning to turn away
from higher priced imports in favor of domestic goods,'' Jones said.
   With the signs of economic strength, comes concern that
production in industries is approaching capacity limits, a
development that could fuel price increases.
   ``The fear would be that this continuing strength ... could be a
source of renewed inflationary pressure,'' Jones said.
   However, Chimerine said, ``I think the fears of an inflationary
boom have been exaggerated right from the start. ... Even with an
upturn in exports, we're not in the midst of an economic boom.''
   Much of the strength in April came in electrical machinery,
where orders took a sharp 4.4 percent jump, following a 3.7 percent
decline in March. Orders for military communications equipment more
than offset drops in orders for other kinds of electrical machinery.
   Orders in the volatile defense goods category rose 1.4 percent,
following a big 15.1 percent increase in March. Orders excluding
defense goods rose 0.8 percent to $106.3 billion.
   There was also strength in primary metals such as steel. Orders
rose 0.2 percent following a 5.5 percent increase in March.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good
sign of business expansion plans, rose 1.4 percent last month
following a 3.9 percent decline. At $32.9 billion, orders were 15.1
percent ahead of last year.
   Orders for civilian aircraft, particularly to Boeing Corp.,
increased. But that was more than offset by a decline in orders for
military planes, leading to an overall 0.3 percent decline in the
transportation category, following a 2.8 percent increase a month
earlier.
   There was also a decrease in orders for non-electrical
machinery. They fell 1.3 percent following a 2.5 percent increase
in March.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 1.1 percent in April to $112.6
billion, following a 3.0 percent increase in March. The backlog of
unfilled orders rose, from $400.4 billion to $404.1 billion, a 0.9
increase.

<HEAD>New State Limits on Gill Net Fishing Anger Vietnamese Fishermen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost 100 Vietnamese fishermen in Boston Harbor,
all former boat people, say they face the loss of their livelihood
this week because of new restrictions on their gill-net fishing
methods.
   But the lobstermen who lobbied the state to enact the new rules
say that it was their livelihood that was threatened by the fishing
method used by the Vietnamese.
   The dispute has led to tension between the two sides, including
one incident in which a lobsterman brandished gun at a Vietnamese
fisherman, the Vietnamese said.
   At issue are restrictions that went into effect this week on the
use in Boston Harbor of gill nets, which are set upright in the
water to catch fish by entangling their gills in their meshes.
Lobstermen said too many lobsters were being caught up in the nets.
   Alex Farent, head of the Boston Lobsterman's Association, said
that ``if in any way this new regulation is not complied with, we
will kiss our livelihoods goodbye. That's it.''
   But to the Vietnamese fishermen, who began fishing in the area
last fall, losing their right to do so comes as an especially cruel
blow. Most of them grew up around boats in Vietnam, and fishing is
their only real skill, said Mai T. Thoi, one of the few of the
fishermen who speaks English.
   ``The state government didn't consider our need to make a
living,'' said Thoi. ``If this regulation continues, there's no way
we can continue our way of life. We are now in an emergency
situation. We need a miracle.''
   Thoi and representatives of the lobstermen met with state
officials Monday, and Thoi was unable to persuade state officials
to relent.
   James Fair, assistant director of the Division of Marine
Fisheries, said gill-net fishing within Boston Harbor is allowed
during the winter, but lobsters often get tangled up in the gill
nets during the summer catch.
   The new regulations were initiated because a valuable resource,
lobsters, is in ``great danger,'' he said. Fair also said that the
Vietnamese, who are not licensed to catch lobsters, have sometimes
retrieved them in their nets.
   Before the rules went into effect, the Vietnamese fished within
three miles of the harbor. Now they must take their boats out about
10 miles into deep water, which they say is too dangerous with
their aging vessels.
   Fair also said the state wanted to stop the conflict between the
Vietnamese and the lobstermen before the tension escalated.
   Three weeks ago, Thoi said, several Vietnamese fishermen
reported being harassed and threatened by local lobstermen.
   Tung Phan, 21, a crew member on one of the boats, said Monday
that a lobsterman had pulled his boat near Phan's boat one day and
showed a knife, yelling at the crew members to ``get out.'' During
another incident, a lobsterman pulled a gun out and brandished it
from his boat, Phan said.
   ``It's ironic,'' said Thoi. ``We had to flee here and we were
trying to survive and now they're not letting us survive.''
   Fair said that state officials ``recognize that they were able
to fish like that in Vietnam, but they have to realize that the
same techniques are not compatible with the way they do things in
Boston Harbor.''
   Thoi said the fishermen hope to continue their fight to be
allowed to fish in the harbor. He said, however, that ``we will
respect the law.''

<HEAD>Robertson Supporters To Boycott Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson supporters said Tuesday they
would boycott next week's Republican convention in North Carolina,
claiming that party regulars are plotting to deny them influence at
the national convention.
   ``By not participating in a process designed to abuse our
delegates, we believe we are today making a positive protest that
we hope will help deter similar behavior in the future,'' said Sue
Wyatt, the state chairman of Robertson's organization.
   Ms. Wyatt accused state GOP Chairman Jack Hawke of stacking key
committees and levying a fee of up to $150 for convention delegates
in an alleged effort to deter Robertson supporters from attending.
   The Robertson leadership's decision apparently will spare the
GOP the bloody fight many had feared at the June 3-4 state
convention.
   But it may signify a reopening of wounds from the party's
clashes of the 1970s between its traditional and New Right wings,
spelling trouble for Gov. Jim Martin and other Republican
candidates who need GOP unity in a state where Democrats outnumber
them by more than 2-to-1.
   The spat pits Robertson supporters, many of whom are new to
party politics, against old-line Republicans who generally
supported Vice President George Bush or Sen. Bob Dole in the
presidential race. Robertson suspended his campaign last week.
   At issue is the interpretation of party rules governing the
election of delegates to the state and national GOP conventions.
   Although Robertson got less than 10 percent of the vote in the
March 8 presidential primary, his supporters packed many precinct
and county conventions _ often comprising a majority.
   They hoped that a sizable number of Robertson supporters would
be elected as delegates to the Republican National Convention in
August, where they could influence the writing of the party
platform and other matters.
   Bush supporters say state law gives their candidate a right to
his choice of at least 29 of North Carolina's 54 national GOP
convention delegates, based on his victory in the primary. They say
Dole, who finished second, won the other 25 delegates, who would be
uncommitted because he quit the race.
   The disagreement led to feuds, walkouts and challenges at
district conventions, including a fistfight at the district
gathering in Louisburg.

   Boris N. Yeltsin, who was fired as Moscow party
boss for disagreeing with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, joined all the
other Supreme Soviet members Tuesday in voting to dismiss himself
from its Presidium.
   All votes are unanimous in the 1,500-member Soviet parliament,
whose function is to endorse Communist Party programs, and
Yeltsin's hand went up with the others when the vote was called for
those favoring his removal.
   Lev N. Zaikov, who also had replaced Yeltsin him as party chief
for Moscow, was given his place in the 36-member Presidium headed
by President Andrei A. Gromyko.
   Yeltsin was fired Nov. 11 after making a fiery speech to Central
Committee meeting on Oct. 21. The full text has not been published,
but the party daily Pravda said Yeltsin criticized the slow pace of
Gorbachev's reforms and said the changes had virtually no effect on
life in Moscow.
   He now is first deputy chairman of the State Construction
Committee, and said to be in charge of meeting the government goal
of providing adequate housing for all citizens by the end of the
century.
   Since Supreme Soviet deputies are chosen on one-party ballots,
Yeltsin probably will remain a member until the next election in
his district.

   House Republicans, expressing ``concern but
not panic'' over polls showing Vice President George Bush trailing
Michael Dukakis, applauded Bush Tuesday for differing with
President Reagan on Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``It's a very symbolic circumstance, where Bush has moved from
being vice president to being his own candidate,'' said Rep. Jim
Leach of Iowa, one of the group attending a 90-minute closed
meeting with top Bush campaign officials.
   ``Almost to a person they were pleased about the separation on
Noriega,'' Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois said of her House GOP
colleagues.
   Bush indicated through aides last weekend that he differed with
the Reagan administration policy of negotiating with Gen. Noriega
in an effort to get him to relinquish power in Panama.
   Part of the deal reportedly being offered by the administration
is to drop drug charges against Noriega if he agrees to leave
Panama temporarily.
   As for the recent polls showing Bush trailing Massachusetts Gov.
Dukakis by margins ranging from 7 to 16 percentage points, Martin
said, ``We have bad polls. If this were October we'd be suicidal.
But it's May.''
   She added, ``There wasn't anybody up screaming, `My God, we've
got the Titanic.' The seas are rough.''
   Meeting with the House members were Lee Atwater, the Bush
campaign manager; Craig Fuller, the vice president's chief of
staff, and pollster Robert Teeter.
   ``They have him behind,'' Teeter said of the polls.
   He said he told the House members that ``we're in a very
artificial period, that period when Dukakis has been rolling along.
What you got to do is get past this California primary before
people begin to focus on it (the presidential race).''
   California is one of four states holding primaries on June 7,
the last big day of the primary season.
   Three recent national polls have jolted Bush partisans. A Gallup
Poll in mid-May had Dukakis leading nationwide 54 percent to 38
percent. A CBS-New York Times poll earlier in the month had Dukakis
ahead 49 to 39, while a Harris poll the same period had the margin
at 50 to 43.
   Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona said there was ``concern, but not
panic'' among the House Republicans.
   Asked if there was concern about the impact of the Bush ticket
on House races, Kolbe replied, ``I don't think anybody is feeling
Bush is going to be a negative.''
   Leach predicted there would be other areas beside Panama where
Bush would express his differences with administration policy.
   ``The public will see a modest differentiation on isues between
Bush and the president,'' said the Iowa congressman. ``A growing
difference on the style of leadership with the vice president
making it clear that he will be an involved, hands-on leader.''
   ``Right now the American people have no particular impression of
either Bush or Dukakis,'' said Martin.
   She and Leach said Dukakis has benefited from his continuing
contest with Jesse Jackson for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   ``He's been allowed to be defined as a moderate,'' said Martin,
because of the contrast with Jackson's views on issues.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than 30 years of launching its own
rockets, the government has, for the first time, hired someone else
to do the job.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, along with
the Commerce Department, announced Monday they have hired General
Dynamics Corp. to be responsible for designing, building and
launching the rockets that will put three weather satellites in
orbit at a cost of $200 million. The satellites are built by Ford
Aerospace.
   The contract carries an option for two more launches of
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites for an
additional $103 million.
   ``This contract is the first U.S. government procurement of
commercial launch transportation services and ushers in a new era
in the commercialization of space,'' NASA said.
   The first of the new series of weather satellites is scheduled
for launch in March 1990 from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   President Reagan, in his new space policy, ordered NASA to use
commercial services as much as possible.
   Until now, NASA has bought rockets from private contractors,
prepared them for flight and then supervised their launch. The new
contract lays all that, as well as responsibility for mission
success, in the lap of General Dynamics.
   The satellites will be launched for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. GOES spacecraft provide visible and
infrared images of weather systems over the Earth, and are
especially valuable for spotting hurricanes and other storms early.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Conviction of Inmate Who Bit Guards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inmate who bit two guards after testing
positive for exposure to the AIDS virus was properly convicted of
assault with a deadly weapon because human bites are inherently
dangerous, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed a Minneapolis federal court ruling that the mouth and
teeth of James Vernell Moore were dangerous weapons. He was
convicted in the January 1987 attack on two guards while he was in
federal custody.
   ``We hold that the evidence at trial was sufficient to sustain a
finding that Moore's mouth and teeth were a deadly and dangerous
weapon because that evidence supported a finding that Moore used
his teeth in a manner likely to inflict serious bodily harm, even
if he had not been infected with the HIV (AIDS) virus,'' the
appeals court said.
   Moore's lawyer had argued that he should be convicted only of
simple assault, not assault with a deadly and dangerous weapon.
   But in upholding the conviction on the more serious charge, the
court cited medical testimony that human bites, even by persons not
exposed to AIDS, can inflict serious injury and transmit serious
diseases.
   Moore, 45, of New York City, was a heroin addict who had tested
positive for the AIDS virus, but did not have AIDS.
   He was convicted of biting guards Timothy Voight and Ronald
McCullough in January 1987, after they tried to take him out of an
office at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn.
   Only one bite broke through skin and that was on Voight's leg.
Voight said last month that tests show he does not have AIDS.
   Defense attorney Kevin Lund had argued that Moore was convicted
of the charge because of the AIDS issue. ``The entire focus of this
case was AIDS-related,'' Lund had told the appeals court panel in a
hearing last month.
   Lund said the government did not present enough proof that the
human mouth and teeth, under any circumstances, are a deadly and
dangerous weapon.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon Hopeman, who prosecuted Moore,
argued that assault, not AIDS, was the issue in the case.
   During the trial, Hopeman said that Moore had told a nurse after
the biting incident that he wanted the guards to die and hoped they
would get AIDS from their wounds.
   A physician testified at Moore's trial that there is no direct
proof that AIDS can be transmitted from a bite. Lund had argued
that lack of such proof meant Moore should have been convicted only
of simple assault.
   U.S. District Judge Diana Murphy sentenced Moore to five years
in prison and made the sentence consecutive to an earlier
conviction. At the time of the biting incident, Moore was serving a
seven-year sentence running to 1991 for credit card fraud. He's now
at the federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill.
   Simple assault carries a maximum three-year sentence.

   Oscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone is
making another Vietnam War movie, this one starring Tom Cruise.
   Stone will direct ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' based on the
life of Ron Kovic, who enlisted in the Army during the Vietnam War
and returned home paralyzed. Kovic then spoke against the war and
joined protesters he had once labeled traitors. He also wrote a
book about his experiences.
   The picture will begin filming in September.
   ``I think Oliver Stone is a terrific person to be making the
film _ the best person to do this story,'' said Kovic. ``The
message in the book and movie is listen, learn and never let it
happen again.''
   Stone's ``Platoon'' won four Academy Awards, including best
picture in 1986.

   Mayor Sonny Bono's mother and
stepfather have walked off their jobs at his restaurant after
allegedly being insulted by a new restaurant manager.
   ``It is a shock,'' said Bono's mother, Jean. ``But I am still
his mother at heart and I would rather not make him look like the
big bad wolf.''
   Bono's mother quit her hostess and public relations jobs the day
her husband, Tony Rose, quit as acting general manager of the
popular desert restaurant named Bono's.
   ``I was insulted by the new manager,'' Rose said.
   Bono, 53, confirmed that Rose left after a squabble with new
general manager, Dick House, but he declined to go into detail.
   ``I think it is something of a family matter and some things
have to stay in the family,'' said Bono, who became famous as half
the Sonny and Cher music team. ``I just wish he would have talked
to me rather than walking out.''

   Hollywood musical star Donald O'Connor
reprised the title song of his most famous movie, ``Singing in The
Rain,'' and sang the Danville High School fight song, accompanied
by actor Gene Hackman, comedians Dick and Jerry Van Dyke and
pianist Bobby Short.
   The five _ Danville natives all _ returned Monday to this
eastern Illinois city to do a benefit for the restoration of the
104-year-old Fischer Theater.
   ``I think it's an investment in the future of the city,'' said
Short. ``I think that Danville must have a downtown ... and the
Fischer is a vital part of downtown.
   Alan Thomann, a spokesman for the Vermilion Heritage Foundation,
which is raising funds to restore the abandoned Fischer, said it
was the first time all five Danville-born stars had appeared
together.
   Thomann noted Hackman and Jerry Van Dyke both worked as ushers
at the Fischer.
   And Dick Van Dyke said he was let in free so many times by his
brother that he felt he had to come back to repay an old debt.
   As for O'Connor, the Fischer was the scene of his first public
appearance. He was carried on stage as a 6-month-old baby by his
vaudevillian mother.

   The natural protein interferon, combined with
standard chemotherapy drugs, shows promise in controlling multiple
myeloma, a lethal form of bone cancer, researchers said Tuesday.
   ``We finally have a leg up on arresting the natural progression
of the disease and producing patients who are alive at five years,
which has been a rarity,'' said Dr. Martin M. Oken of the
University of Minnesota.
   His research is part of a new effort by scientists to find a
role for interferon by combining it with the drugs that have long
been used to attack cancer.
   Oken said interferon might provide a knockout punch after cancer
has been weakened, but not destroyed, by medicines.
   The work may also represent a revival of the fortunes of
interferon, which has been on a roller coaster of public acclaim
and disdain for a decade.
   Interferon is a natural, hormone-like substance that, among
other things, helps regulate the body's immune system. When the
human gene that makes this chemical was isolated, some experts
predicted many uses for interferon in eliminating cancer and
infections.
   However, studies showed that when used alone, interferon had
little major impact on any cancer except an exceedingly rare
malignancy called hairy cell leukemia, for which it has become
standard therapy.
   In the latest research, presented at the annual meeting of the
American Association of Clinical Oncology, doctors found that
interferon plus chemotherapy produced complete remissions in 30
percent of the 54 patients studied.
   Such remissions, in which all signs of the disease are gone, are
rare in multiple myeloma, and they are the first step toward curing
the disease.
   In all, 41 percent of the patients had remissions that were
complete or nearly complete. In an earlier study, only 11 percent
of the patients reached this level after receiving chemotherapy
alone.
   In another study presented at the meeting, doctors from the
University of North Carolina showed promising early results of
testing interferon against chronic myelogenous leukemia.
   ``These are interesting results,'' said Dr. James Griffin of the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ``Response rates can be
improved and toxicity minimized by these recombinant proteins.''
   About 11,000 new cases of multiple myeloma and 5,000 cases of
chronic myelogenous leukemia are found each year.
   This form of leukemia can be effectively treated with bone
marrow transplants. However, many victims do not receive
transplants because no suitable narrow donors are available.
   Dr. Howard Ozer and his colleagues at the University of North
Carolina found they could reduce the outward signs of myelogenous
leukemia and help the body replace defective cells with normal ones.
   ``For the first time, there is a drug available that potentially
keeps the abnormal (cell) clone under control and allows the normal
clone to come back,'' Ozer said.
   His team tested interferon on 112 people with this form of
cancer. They found that 70 percent of them improved, although it is
still too soon to know how the treatment affects long-term survival.
   He said that interferon may have to be given for several years
to keep the disease under control.
   Oken said more study will be needed as well to see how
interferon affects multiple myeloma over time. However, he added,
``I think it's a real advance.''
   Typically, about 30 percent of multiple myeloma patients survive
for five years.
   Just how interferon works against cancer is unclear. Ozer
speculates that it acts as a sort of negative growth regulator,
shutting down bone marrow cells that produce cancerous blood cells.
   Interferon is produced by inserting a human gene into bacteria
or yeast, which can churn out the substance in limitless
quantities. It is just one of several otherwise rare natural
chemicals to be made through genetic engineering.

<TEXT>
   Sailors searching a swamp near the
airport in the seaside city of Cartagena on Tuesday captured a
hijacker who commandeered a jet across the Americas and demanded
$100,000 and an audience with Mother Teresa.
   The navy said Gonzalo Carreno Nieto was found hiding in mangrove
roots about 300 yards from a Cartagena airport runway, still
clutching the toy grenade he had used to hijack an Avianca airlines
Boeing 727 on Monday morning while on a domestic flight from the
drug capital of Medellin to Bogota.
   The hijack began shortly after 9 a.m. when Carreno diverted the
plane back to Medellin, where he freed all 128 passengers and three
flight attendants. He then ordered the cockpit crew into the sky on
a trip that took the aircraft to Panama, where it was refueled,
then to the island of Aruba off Venezuela and back to Colombia when
the pilot persuaded him they couldn't make it to Cuba.
   He demanded $100,000, said he was terminally ill with cancer and
wanted to die a big spender, and at one point asked to be flown to
India to meet with Mother Teresa, the Nobel Prize-winning Roman
Catholic nun known for her humanitarian work.
   The 45-year-old convicted kidnapper, described as mentally
deranged, slipped away from the jet as it taxied on a runway after
it landed at Cartagena on Monday night after the 11-hour hijack. A
navy communique issued in Bogota said he was captured in a nearby
swamp Tuesday morning by sailors and marines.
   Carreno had used a toy gun to kidnap an uncle four years ago,
the navy said.
   Before that, Carreno spent nine years in prison awaiting trial
on a murder charge, and he apparently became mentally deranged
while incarcerated, according to his attorney, Guillermo Garcia.
   Colombian justice frequently is slow unless the accused have
enough money to pay their way out of prison, as several big cocaine
smugglers have done in recent years.
   Carreno eventually was found innocent of the murder charge, but
after he got out of prison he turned to crime and became a cocaine
addict, Garcia said in a broadcast interview with the Colombian
radio network Caracol.
   The Avianca crew told Carreno that the jet didn't have enough
fuel to make it to Cuba and that it would be better to try to land
in Cartagena. The hijacker agreed.
   Without warning the Cartagena tower, the pilot landed the plane
at 8:10 p.m. EDT, apparently surprising police and Avianca
employees.
   As the plane taxied in the darkness toward the terminal, the
hijacker lowered the stairway out of the rear of the plane, jumped
off and disappeared into the darkness.
   The navy sent marines and sailors to search the area around the
airport, and he was found at first light Tuesday. The navy said
Carreno was wet and hungry and that his clothes were torn from
running through the swamp.
   Carreno began babbling that he had a heart condition, so he was
examined at the Cartagena naval hospital to see if his health
claims were true, the navy said.

<HEAD>Soviet Pullout Slowed by Guerrillas Making Gains in East</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Kremlin probably won't meet the
goal of pulling one-fourth of its soldiers out of Afghanistan this
month because guerrillas are overwhelming Afghan troops left
behind, diplomats said Tuesday.
   Western diplomats based in Islamabad said Moslem insurgents have
harassed departing Red Army convoys and overrun a string of bases
defended only by Afghan soldiers. Most of the bases are on the
eastern border with Pakistan.
   ``The regime has lost 18 district towns since mid-March, an
unprecedented string of losses with tactical implications,''
strengthening the belief that the Afghan army cannot fight the
guerrillas alone, one diplomat said.
   Soviet forces began their withdrawal May 15 under terms of an
agreement signed April 14 in Geneva, and Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov had
said 25 percent of the 115,000 soldiers would be out by the end of
May.
   The sources quoted dispatches from their embassies in Kabul,
capital of Afghanistan, as reporting only one Soviet combat unit on
the move in the past week, a 165-vehicle column consisting largely
of armor and artillery.
   They had no figures on the number of soldiers who had crossed
the northern border into Soviet territory.
   ``It is difficult to see how the 25 percent withdrawal this
month, promised by Gromov, will be achieved,'' a diplomat said.
   He said there were guerrilla attacks on the first Soviet unit to
leave the country.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in 1978
and Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979.
The guerrillas receive military aid from the United States, China
and other countries through Pakistan, where more than 3 million
Afghan refugees live in border camps and cities.
   Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Soviet Union and United States signed
the Geneva agreement, which was mediated by the United Nations.
   The guerrillas were not invited to the negotiations and said
they would ignore the result, but well-known commander Ahmad Shah
Masood is said to have agreed not to fire on the Soviets if they
withdraw peacefully. He controls a large portion of the mountains
and valleys north of Kabul.
   Masood, who leads the Jamiat-i-Islami group, has made deals
before and always exacts a price. Diplomats said they did not know
what it was this time.
   Senior Pakistani diplomats said Tuesday their government will
push during follow-up talks in Geneva this week for speedy
formation of a transitional government in Kabul and faster Soviet
withdrawal.
   ``Its time that something substantive is done to put together a
broad-based ... government to ... prevent bloodsheed,'' said a
Foreign Ministry official, whose name was withheld in keeping with
government rules.
   Reports from the Western diplomats indicate fighting in the past
week was concentrated north and west of Kabul along the Soviet
withdrawal route, and in the eastern provinces near Pakistan.
   Afghan forces also have evacuated some eastern military outposts
but others have fallen to guerrilla attack.
   No figures on prisoners have been released by the insurgent
alliance's headquarters in Peshawar, Pakistan, but both guerrillas
and diplomats say the number of Afghan soldiers defecting or
surrendering since the Soviet pullout began could be in the
thousands.
   Photographs taken at some captured army posts show large amounts
of weapons, supplies and abandoned vehicles.
   Control of the east also opens new supply routes for the
guerrillas, who are slowly pushing toward Kabul. The border camps
just inside Pakistan serve as bases and supply points for the
insurgents.

   A dozen American folk artists, ranging from a
Czech-American egg painter to a Hawaiian cowboy singer and ukelele
player, have been awarded grants from the National Endowment of the
Arts for their efforts to preserve the artistic legacy of their
forebears.
   The 12 were selected from among 155 traditional artists
nominated by their peers to receive the $5,000 National Heritage
Fellowships, NEA Chairman Frank Hodsoll said in announcing the
grants Tuesday.
   ``Among this nation's greatest treasures is our rich and varied
traditional heritage,'' Hodsoll said. ``Through these awards, we
seek to honor America's great traditional artists _ those who
successfully preserve and pass on the artistic legacy of their
forebears and enrich our culture.''
   ``In a way, it's a celebration of ourselves in all of our
glorious diversity,'' said Dan Sheehy, assistant director of the
endowment's folk arts program, which initiated the awards in 1982
to honor master practitioners of the traditional arts.
   The awards will be presented to the recipients formally at a
ceremony on Sept. 29 in Washington.
   The recipients included Amber Densmore, 87, of Chelsea, Vt., who
has made countless quilts, bedspreads, lace doilies and hooked rugs
in her lifetime but has never sold a single piece of work.
   In a statement issued by NEA, she said, ``I've given it all
away. You'll just have to go and see my grandchildren.''
   Arthel ``Doc'' Watson, 65, an Appalachian guitar player and
singer from Deep Gap, N.C., recently announced his plans to retire
after 26 years on the road. Watson, who was blinded at age 2 and
first picked up a guitar at 12, has won four Grammy awards from the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
   Yang Fang Nhu, who was born in a small Hmong mountain village in
northern Laos in 1912, came to the United States with her husband,
Yang Nouyi, in 1984. She is a master weaver and embroiderer and is
passing on her skills to her daughter-in-law, with whom she and her
husband currently live in Detroit.
   The other award recipients were:
   Pedro Ayala, 77, a Mexican-American accordion player from Donna,
Texas.
   Kepka Belton, 54, a Czech-American egg painter from Ellsworth,
Kan.
   Michael Flatley, 30, an Irish-American stepdancer from Chicago.
   Sister Rosalia Haberl, 91, a German-American bobbin lacemaker
from Hankinson, N.D.
   John Dee Holeman, 58, an Afro-American dancer, musician and
singer from Durham, N.C.
   Kenny Sidle, 57, an Anglo-American fiddler in the Midwest
tradition from Newark, Ohio.
   Albert Luandrew, 81, also known as ``Sunnyland Slim,'' an
Afro-American blues pianist and singer from Chicago.
   Willie Mae Ford Smith, 82, an Afro-American gospel singer from
St. Louis.
   Clyde Sproat, 60, a Hawaiian cowboy singer and ukulele player
from Kapaau, Hawaii.

   A Taca International Airlines jetliner
reportedly carrying 45 people lost power in both engines as it
approached New Orleans on Tuesday and made an emergency landing on
grass six miles away, an official said.
   There were no reports of injuries, said a controller at New
Orleans International Airport.
   A controller said the pilot, who was apparently coming in from
Latin America, radioed he lost power in both engines of the Boeing
737.
   ``It was clean landing,'' said Kathy Fernandez, an employee at
the U.S. Department of Agriculture offices who said she saw the
landing as she went outside to her car.
   ``It came down nice. Just fine. As soon as it landed, the door
opened, the chute came down and the people came out and ran away
from the plane.''
   ``As soon as they got out, they just ran up the levee up the
back. It started raining about five minutes after that. It really
started to pour.''
   The controller, who would not give his name, said the plane went
down shortly after noon, about six miles east of the airport, at
the National Space Technology Laboratory, and landed behind the
agriculture department offices.
   The levee is to the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet, a shortcut to
the Port of New Orleans.
   Tom Branigan, a spokesman for Martin-Marietta Corp., the main
contractor at the space facility, said a stewardess told one of his
colleagues that the flight originated in San Salvador with a stop
in Belize.
   Unofficial reports put the number of passengers at 36 with a
crew of nine, he said.
   He said there is an overgrown paved strip at the facility, but
the plane came down on the grass. He said the plane did not appear
damaged.
   He said two passengers with pre-existing medical problems _ one
recent surgery and one high blood pressure _ were taken to a
medical facility at NASA.
   Customs officials also were notified, Branigan said.

   The federal government should move all hotels
and other concessions out of the national parks, an environmental
group said Tuesday in releasing a report on what it considers the
10 most threatened parks.
   George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society, also urged
the government to end subsidies for activities of other federal
agencies that could hurt the parks.
   ``Motels and hotels and that kind of thing should go outside the
national parks,'' Frampton said at a news conference. ``Jails and
concession stands don't belong in a sound master plan.''
   In its section on Yosemite National Park in California, the
report noted that plans call for a beauty parlor and a jail.
   Frampton's remarks were the latest in more than 60 years of
controversy over what the national parks should contain. There have
been hotels in the parks since the earliest days of the National
Park Service, which was founded in 1916 _ and calls for their
removal almost as long.
   Denis Galvin, deputy director of the service, said the agency
did not want to add any hotels in parks. But he said it believed
``the level of development in the traditional parks is appropriate
and provides an opportunity for a park experience that's rapidly
becoming unique. ... and just as valid as the backpacking
experience. We aim to provide both.''
   The society's report was timed to coincide with the beginning of
the summer vacation season that could bring record visitor loads to
many parks, and to precede the first meeting in 12 years of all
park superintendents, scheduled for next month at a lodge near
Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
   The Wilderness Society and other advocacy groups have stepped up
campaigns in recent years for protective measures to be taken
outside park boundaries. ``These lands should have been in the
parks in the first place,'' Frampton said.
   ``We are losing $200 million to $300 million every year selling
our trees,'' frequently from Forest Service lands near national
parks, Frampton said. Much of this logging destroys habitat for
wildlife that roams freely across park boundaries, opponents say.
   ``The transfer of $100 million from this activity would make an
enormous difference without costing the taxpayer a cent,'' Frampton
said.
   More than $100 million is needed, Frampton said. He noted that
the Wilderness Society is part of a lobbying coalition that seeks
enactment of a trust fund for federal, state and local park and
recreation land that would eventually yield $1 billion a year.
   Galvin said the service believes logging is acceptable with
proper safeguards such as preservation of critical wildlife habitat.
   Here is the society's list of the 10 most threatened
installations, listed alphabetically because no ranking was given,
and the major threats in the group's view. All are national parks
except the Manassas battlefield, a national battlefield park, and
the Santa Monica Mountains, a national recreation area.
   _Everglades, Fla.: changes in water quality and quantity because
of agricultural and uran development, also planned low-altitude
fights by the Air Force.
   _Glacier, Mont.: oil drilling, logging and construction nearby.
   _Grand Canyon, Ariz.: noise from sightseeing flights, expected
to be reduced by forthcoming regulations, as well as mining nearby
and operation of the Glen Canyon Dam upstream for peaking power,
disturbing flow in the Colorado River.
   _Great Smoky Mountains, Tenn. and N.C.: logging nearby, air
pollution and destruction by wild boars brought to the area in the
1920s.
   _Manassas, Va., a shopping center planned on 542 acres adjacent
to the Civil War battlefield.
   _Olympic, Wash.: nearby logging and destruction by non-native
wild goats.
   _Rocky Mountain, Colo.: overcrowding and nearby logging and
condominium construction.
   _Santa Monica Mountains, Calif.: potential development on
private lands within the boundaries. The federal government may
never be able to afford the $3 billion or so it now will cost to
buy those lands, originally planned for purchase, officials have
testified.
   _Yellowstone, Wyo., Mont. and Idaho: nearby logging, oil
exploration and winter use by snowmobilers.
   _Yosemite, Calif.: congestion in Yosemite Valley, tourist
flights and nearby logging.
   Galvin of the park service said the society could be performing
a service calling attention to threats that might not be visible to
park visitors, ``but I don't know that we'd pick the same 10 parks.
... I don't know what purpose such a list serves except publicity.''

   The U.S. Army, which last year won the
Boeselager Cup competition in West Germany for the first time, has
taken both first and second places this year, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
   The competition, designed to test the reconnaissance skills of
cavalry scout units, this year attracted 26 teams from various NATO
countries.
   The winning team was from the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry
Regiment, 1st Armored Division, while the second-place finisher
came from the 1st Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. Both are
assigned to the U.S. Army Europe.
   ``This is the first time that our guys have taken first and
second place,'' said Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.
``Our stuff works and our people do, too.''
   Each team was judged in eight events, including a 30-kilometer
reconnaissance patrol, a 300-meter tactical swim carrying a
50-pound rucksack and weapon, a 3-kilometer run, M-16 marksmanship,
enemy identification, night orienteering, driving skill and
coordination of Army aircraft.

<HEAD>Three Killed in Clash at Peasant March, Army Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marchers demanding that an oil field be
closed clashed with the army, and two soldiers and a protester were
killed, the army said Tuesday.
   The deaths came as thousands of peasants marched on a half dozen
cities to demand land and nationalization of foreign oil companies.
   The military has said the protests were organized by leftist
guerrillas. It said rebels were responsible for shooting at the
soldiers Monday, and it identified the dead protester as a
guerrilla.
   The guerrillas were part of the National Liberation Army and the
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, Gen. Yanine Diaz said in his
communique.
   Ecopetrol, the government's oil company, summoned the army to
its oil field in eastern Colombia after leaders of a peasant march
demanded that the field be shut down.
   The fighting occurred about 160 miles northeast of the capital,
near the city of Bucaramanga.
   Some radio stations have reported as many as 80,000 peasants
joining in the marches. But newspapers have said they number about
16,000.
   Diaz said Tuesday that guerrillas were forcing the peasants to
march.
   He also reported a rash of damaging rebel attacks Tuesday on
public facilities near Bucaramanga, including a gas and oil
pipeline, an electric tower, and a bridge.

<HEAD>Debate Du Jour: Tips or Service Charge?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What's cooking at the National Restaurant
Association convention? The debate du jour is whether to tip or not
to tip.
   Some restaurateurs are calling for a switch to a flat service
charge, as is common in Europe. But many find the idea unappetizing.
   A federal tax law that went into effect Jan. 1 requires
restaurants to pay taxes on waiters' tips. And if waiters fudge on
the amount of tips they get, the Internal Revenue Service can hold
restaurants liable for taxes on the unreported gratuities.
   Proponents of a service charge say that, among other things, it
would make tax-related paperwork easier and would make cheating
harder.
   ``Let's face it. There are hundreds of thousands of waiters
earning $40,000 and declaring $10,000,'' said Susan Wine, who helps
run the expensive Quilted Giraffe, which replaced tips with a
service charge three years ago.
   ``The law never brought the owner in before,'' Mrs. Wine said
Tuesday from New York. ``It never made him a co-conspirator. It
always said, `What he doesn't know won't hurt him.'
   ``That's changed, and now the big places will have to face up to
millions of dollars in tax liability.''
   But if customers don't like a required service charge?
   ``I just say, `Then don't come to my restaurant,''' said Michael
McCarty of Santa Monica, Calif., owner of an chain of restaurants
in Colorado and California that tacks on a 15 percent charge.
   McCarty took part in a lively discussion of tipping Monday, held
during the the 69th annual convention of the National Restaurant
Association this week.
   But Arnie Morton, owner of Arnie's, a popular dining spot for
celebrities on Chicago's Gold Coast, said he once helped run a
Playboy Club that had a service charge and ``it was a huge
mistake.''
   ``You lose motivation, attention,'' Morton said. ``I think the
service is going to slip if a waiter knows he's got an automatic 15
percent tip.''
   On Chicago's South Side, two women in favor of leaving tips up
to the customer helped form a group called Waitresses Against
Involuntary Tipping, or WAIT.
   Eileen Wheatley and Linda Siekman say owners of expensive
restaurants don't understand the needs of workers at more modest
eateries. And if the owners want to eliminate tips, they should
provide other benefits, the women say.
   Waiter Luis Cruz, filling a drink order Tuesday at Palmer's
Steak House in the downtown Loop, said he might come out ahead with
a service charge.
   ``Most of our tips come on credit cards, so the restaurant knows
what we're taking in anyway,'' said Cruz, 26. ``But in a way,
perhaps it's better. If a service charge is 15 percent, that's more
than I get from some.''
   Jim Peterson, president of the restaurant association, says the
issue is mostly a concern at expensive restaurants where a juicy
steak, fine wine and rich dessert can add up to a hefty bill _ and
a handsome tip.
   While his group has no taken no stance, Peterson acknowledges
that many members are frustrated over the new federal law.
   ``It's burdensome,'' Peterson said. ``Restaurateurs have been
put in the position of being a tax collector, getting information
from waiters and reporting it to the government.
   ``This issue has been on the top burner during our meeting
here,'' he said. ``What most restaurant owners want to be conscious
of is what the customer finds acceptable. In the end, that would be
the most important thing.''
   Joan Lang, executive editor of Restaurant Business, hopes to
publish results of a straw poll of restaurateurs in July.
   ``It's pretty controversial,'' she said. ``There are some people
who are very opposed to it and some who think its time has come.
The gut feeling is it's pretty evenly divided.''

<TEXT>
   George Bush, the only Republican
presidential candidate to make a campaign stop in the U.S. Virgin
Islands, likely will be rewarded with the territory's four
delegates to the GOP convention, a campaign official says.
   Balloting among the 2,108 registered Republican voters is set
for Saturday.
   ``The vice president, of course, was the only candidate _ when
we had lots of them _ who responded to our call to come to the
Virgin Islands,'' chairwoman Charlotte Poole-Davis said.
   Ms. Poole-Davis said Bush favors extending to Virgin Islanders
the right to vote in presidential elections, and he pledged to
include the territory in federal economic devolopment plans.
   Currently, the residents of this U.S. territory, and the nearby
island of Puerto Rico, may participate in Republican and Democratic
presidential nominating conventions, but cannot vote directly for
president in the general election.
   Four delegates and four alternates will be elected Saturday. Ms.
Poole-Davis said she thinks Bush will garner all four votes.
   Last June, Bush made a four-hour sweep through St. Croix. He
attended a fund-raising dinner at a local restaurant and then a
reception at Government House before flying to Puerto Rico for
other engagements.

<HEAD>Soviets Watch Simulated Nerve Gas Attack on British Troops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Soviets to visit a chemical
warfare plant in Western Europe watched Tuesday as British troops
ripped off their helmets, donned gas masks and injected themselves
with antidote against a simulated nerve gas attack.
   Armed only with cameras and notebooks, the 13 Soviet scientists
and military experts responded by expressing hope that their
three-day visit would help promote progress on negotiations for a
global chemical weapons ban.
   Maj. Gen. Robert Fedorovich Razuvanov, commander of the chemical
warfare facility at Shikany in the eastern Soviet Union, modeled a
British gas mask for dozens of photographers.
   ``The visit is extremely significant and shows that glasnost is
starting to happen,'' said Dr. Graham Pearson, director of the
Porton Down facility, referring to the policy of openness by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Among those watching the 45-minute display on the manicured lawn
outside the Chemical Warfare Defense Center at Porton Down in
southwest England was Yuri Nazarkin, the chief Soviet negotiator at
the 40-nation Geneva Conference on Disarmament.
   Nine British soldiers, carrying SA80 automatic rifles and
wearing protective camouflage uniforms, sprawled on the lawn
preparing for a simulated battle. When an alarm went off in a
nerve-agent detector, the soldiers ripped off their helmets and
pulled gas masks over their faces, screaming: ``Gas, gas, gas!''
   They later injected themselves in the hip through their clothing
with a simulated antidote used by the British armed forces against
nerve agent poisoning.
   Using a portable monitor, the soldiers measured the presence of
nerve agents and mustard gas in the air. Finally, they
decontaminated a Scorpion tank using chemical reagents.
   The Porton Down facility, which sprawls across 7,000 acres of a
nature preserve near the ancient Stonehenge monument about 80 miles
southwest of London, concentrates on defenses against chemical
warfare.
   ``We're not going to reveal all,'' said Pearson. ``We won't show
them the detailed assessment of what agents we think other
countries might have, but we will be open about the way in which we
protect the British armed forces against the effects of chemical
and biological warfare.''
   Britain produced chemical weapons until the 1950s, when it
halted all production and destroyed its stockpile.
   Pearson said talks between the British and visiting Soviet
experts would cover the full-range of chemical weapons issues
including production, detection, protection, monitoring,
decontamination, medical countermeasures and disposal.
   In July, Pearson and a dozen British experts will visit Shikhany.
   Some delegates to the Geneva Conference predicted that 20 years
of talks would culminate this year in an international agreement
banning the development, production and stockpiling of chemical
weapons. But three months of negotiations ended April 29 with no
breakthrough in sight.
   ``It is very important for our negotiations in Geneva that we
have more information about what kind of chemical weapons exist,''
said Tessa Solesby, the British ambassador to the Geneva Conference.
   One major stumbling block, along with verification, is the size
of the Soviet chemical weapons stockpile. The Soviets only
acknowledged in April 1987 that they had a stockpile of 50,000
tons, but Western experts estimated it was closer to 300,000 tons _
the largest in the world.
   Although chemical weapons have been used widely in the Iran-Iraq
war, the only country besides the Soviet Union to acknowledge
possessing such weapons is the United States, which has a stockpile
estimated at 30,000 tons.

   A devastating explosion killed eight people and
seriously injured three in a storage area of a fish farm east of
Moscow, the nightly news program Vremya reported Tuesday. Six of
those killed were firemen.
   The broadcast showed what appeared to have been a huge brick
storehouse reduced to rubble, and an announcer said the blast was
probably the result of improper storage of chemicals or fuel.
   An investigation was ordered into the cause of the explosion,
Vremya said.
   A.V. Larin, deputy chief of the Moscow region's fire prevention
service, told the news program local firefighters responded to a
report at 11:15 p.m. Sunday of a fire at the warehouse in
Yegorievsk, a town of about 73,000 people approximately 60 miles
east of Moscow.
   The report said six of those killed were firemen who arrived to
put out the blaze and the other two were fishermen who were
standing nearby.
   The broadcast said three people were in serious condition at a
local hospital, but gave no details.
   The news announcer said Soviet Ministry of Fisheries enterprises
in the Russian republic alone were hit by fire 526 times in the
past two years with 63 people killed.
   Vremya did not comment on the statistics, but the disclosure
suggested that the ministry is considered to be lax in enforcing
safety rules.

<HEAD>Justice Alleges Former Yale Academic Wrote Anti-Jewish Nazi
Propaganda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has begun deportation
proceedings against a former Yale University faculty member accused
of assisting the persecution of Jewish civilians as a Nazi
propagandist during World War II.
   In an order filed with the U.S. Immigration Court, the
department alleged that Vladimir Sokolov, 75, of Milford, Conn., a
lecturer who taught the Russian language at Yale for 17 years,
voluntarily served in Orel, Russia, from 1942 to 1944 as a writer
and a deputy editor of the newspaper Rech.
   The Russian-language newspaper was published by the German Army
in the Nazi-occupied Soviet Union.
   The department's Nazi-hunting unit, the Office of Special
Investigations, alleged in Monday's court filing that Sokolov wrote
and edited articles that advocated the persecution and
extermination of Jews and the defeat of the Allied powers,
including the United States.
   Sokolov was awarded medals by the German army for his work.
   Sokolov was stripped of his citizenship by the U.S. District
Court in Connecticut in 1986. The U.S. Supreme Court last week
declined to review a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals that
upheld the lower court decision.
   From 1944 to the end of the war, Sokolov served as a writer in
Berlin for the Russian-language propaganda newspapers Zarya and
Volya Naroda. These two papers published attacks on the Jewish
people and urged Russians to support the Nazi war effort.
   The department says that because of his wartime assistance,
Sokolov was ineligible for admission to the United States under the
Displaced Persons Act, under which he was provided with a visa in
May 1951.

<HEAD>Temps Paid 30 Percent Below National Average, Survey Finds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers provided by temporary help companies
are paid about 30 percent below the national average and only
one-fourth get medical benefits enjoyed by virtually all full-time
employees, the government said Tuesday.
   In its first-ever nationwide survey of the burgeoning temporary
help industry, the Labor Department found the average wage paid
last September to temporary workers by firms who hire out their
services was $6.42 an hour.
   The average hourly wage for all non-supervisory workers in
private industry nationwide for the same month was $9.06 an hour,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   While still less than 1 percent of the U.S. work force, the
so-called ``temps'' _ who are supervised by client firms but are on
the payroll of temporary help companies _ are one of the
fastest-growing classes of workers in the country.
   In 1987, they grew by 13 per cent to just slightly over 1
million by the end of the year.
   Average hourly wages for temporary workers last September ranged
from less than $4 an hour for construction laborers up to nearly
$25 an hour for engineers. But there were considerable differences
within both occupations and geographic areas.
   For example, wages for word processors provided by temporary
services ranged from $6.09 an hour in Indianapolis to $14.11 in New
York City. Similarly, wages for non-construction laborers provided
by such services ranged from an average $3.73 an hour in Denver to
$6.43 in Newark, N.J.
   In a few isolated instances where shortages in certain skills
has put a premium on the pay that temporary workers can demand, the
government found them being paid more than their full-time
co-workers in the same occupation.
   Temporary word processors in the Bergen-Passaic, N.J., area were
paid $9.58 an hour compared to an average wage of $9.31 an hour
paid full-time employees in the same occupation.
   However, that was the exception, not the rule. Temporary
secretaries in Bergen and Passaic were paid an average $9.34 an
hour, or 81 percent of the $10.59 average paid their full-time
counterparts.
   The gap was wider elsewhere. In Baltimore, secretaries provided
by temp services averaged $6.68 hour, or 62 percent of the average
$10.59 paid to full-time secretaries. In Kansas City, temporary
secretaries averaged $5.84 an hour or 60 percent of the $9.80 paid
their full-time counterparts.
   But it is in the area of benefits _ which now account for about
40 percent of some employers' labor costs, according to the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce _ where the savings become evident in using
temporary workers.
   The government's data showed only 37 percent of temporaries
hired out by contracting companies get paid holidays and 74 percent
have paid vacations, compared with 99 percent of the permanent,
full-time workers who enjoy both.
   And less than one-fourth of the nation's temporary workers
receive any kind of employer-provided hospitalization and medical
benefits compared with 96 percent of the permanent workers who get
them, the Labor Department said.

<HEAD>Historian Blasts Soviet Foreign Policy Under Stalin, Brezhnev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A historian has criticized Soviet dictator Josef
V. Stalin for setting the Soviet Union down a path that led to
years of confrontation with the West.
   Vyacheslav Dashichev, a doctor of historical science, wrote in
the May 18 edition of the newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta that the
problems began mostly after World War II.
   Stalin tried to spread his brand of socialism ``wherever
possible, unified in all countries, regardless of their national
specifics,'' Dashichev said.
   The article made the point that the re-examination of Soviet
policies under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
greater openness had focused only on problems in domestic affairs,
and not foreign affairs. Mistakes also were made in foreign
affairs, Dashichev said.
   Soviet foreign policy was at least partly to blame for the arms
buildup in the West and for the Western perception of a Soviet
military threat, he wrote.
   ``Supercentralism in internal policy unavoidably gave rise to
hegemony and a feeling of great power in foreign policy,'' the
article said.
   This policy led to Soviet splits with Yugoslavia, China and
Albania, according to Dashichev.
   The historian wrote that Stalin's view of an expanding socialist
revolution was largely to blame for provoking U.S. imperialistic
aggression.
   Under the late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev,
``miscalculations and an incompetent approach'' brought heightened
confrontation with the West, the article said.
   ``Through our political, military, diplomatic involvement, we
ignored the influence of regional conflicts on detente between the
USSR and the West and on the entire system of mutual
relationships,'' Dashichev wrote.
   Brezhnev involved the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He sent in
troops in December 1979, and only now, under Gorbachev, are they
withdrawing.
   The historian said the main goal in Soviet foreign policy should
be to establish mutual trust with the West, especially in nuclear
disarmament. The Soviet Union should try to get its way on the
international scene not through force but through ``economic,
political, scientific and cultural successes.''
   Gorbachev has called for ``new thinking'' in Soviet foreign
policy to work in what he calls a ``new system of international
peace and security.'' Gorbachev believes the best way for countries
to avoid conflict is to put international coexistence above
national self-interest.

<HEAD>Northeast Home Prices Still Skyrocketing, Up 4 Percent Nationally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Home prices continued to skyrocket in several
Northeastern cities during the first three months of 1988, but the
hot New York City market cooled somewhat after the October stock
market crash, a real estate trade group said Tuesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said the median price of
existing single family homes in Washington, D.C., metro area jumped
to $132,400, a 24.7 percent increase when compared with the first
quarter of 1987.
   Hartford, Conn., with an appreciation of 21.8 percent to a
median price of $166,400, and Providence, R.I., with an increase of
19.9 percent to $123,300, ranked second and third.
   ``While trouble in the financial markets has affected certain
pocket areas, like the area around New York City, the (Northeast)
region as a whole is still exceptionally vigorous,'' said John A.
Tuccillo, the association's chief economist.
   In New York and its suburbs, the median resale price was
$186,600, up 10.2 percent over a year ago but down from the peak of
$190,300 in July-September 1987.
   Prices also rose sharply in some West Coast cities. The
appreciation rate was 18.3 percent in Los Angeles; 16 percent in
Orange County, Calif., which includes Anaheim and Santa Ana; 11.2
percent in San Francisco; and 10.3 percent in San Diego.
   Nationally, prices rose 4.1 percent to a median of $88,100,
meaning half the houses sold for more and half for less. Forty-four
of the 62 metro areas surveyed posted price increases, while 16
posted declines. The information to calculate price changes wasn't
available for two cities.
   Most cities suffering price declines were in regions heavily
dependent on oil or farming. Oklahoma City posted the largest drop,
9.5 percent, followed by Houston, 7 percent, and Denver, 6.9
percent.
   Honolulu, which was included in the survey for the first time,
supplanted New York as the costliest housing area in the nation.
Median prices in Honolulu were $198,400.
   Following Honolulu was Orange County, Calif., $183,300; San
Francisco, $178,800; and Boston, $176,900.
   The least costly housing area was Louisville, Ky., where the
median home cost $51,100. Lansing, Mich., was next at $54,400,
followed by Des Moines, Iowa, $54,500; Grand Rapids, Mich.,
$55,400; and Oklahoma City, $56,500.
   Although prices increased in most areas, the pace of sales
slackened from last year's record levels in most areas. Sales
slackened in 28 states and the District of Columbia.
   Twenty of the states suffered declines of 10 percent or more. Of
those, nine had drops of more than 20 percent.
   ``Although there were more resale decreases than increases, many
of the declines were in comparison to a surge in sales during the
first quarter of 1987,'' Tuccillo said.
   Minnesota, with a 39.3 percent decline, suffered the biggest
setback of any state. Other states with large declines in the pace
of sales were Colorado, with a 31.4 percent drop; Arkansas, down
25.2 percent; and New Hampshire, down 24.8 percent.
   By contrast, Alaska recorded a 77.1 percent increase in sales,
followed by Kentucky, with a 28.6 percent rise; Vermont, with a
25.8 percent pickup; Nevada, up 23.7 percent; and West Virginia, up
18.9 percent.
   Nationally, existing homes sold at an annual rate of 3.66
million units during the quarter, 8 percent lower than a year ago.
   Despite the decline, association officials said sales were still
strong. They noted that sales in early 1987 were propelled by
relatively low interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages, which fell
to nine-year lows of 9 percent to 9.5 percent, on average. Rates in
the first quarter of this year were about a percentage point higher.
   Tuccillo said he expected the national sales pace to decline by
6 percent for the rest of the year, with prices rising between 5
percent and 6 percent.

<HEAD>Judge Overturns $785,000 Libel Ruling Against Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $785,000 libel judgment won by a former
county prosecutor has been overturned by the trial judge, who said
that the news stories were expressions of opinion about the
official protected by the First Amendment.
   The ruling Monday by District Judge Jack Litman cancels the
damages awarded by a jury to former Carlton County Attorney Donald
Diesen three weeks earlier after a nine-day trial in his lawsuit
against the Duluth News-Tribune.
   ``The judge did what the jury should have done but failed to do:
protected opinion and matters of public concern and interest as
First Amendment rights,'' said Thomas Thibodeau, a lawyer for the
newspaper.
   Diesen, who had sought $2.5 million in damages, declined comment
on the ruling, but his lawyer, Patrick Tierney, said it would be
appealed.
   ``I didn't expect this,'' Tierney said. ``But I'm not shocked by
it, either. It's unusual for a judge to overturn a jury verdict,
but in this case we are dealing with a complicated legal issue:
whether you can defame by a false implication from a series of
accurate statements. The judge allowed the jury to decide that
issue.''
   In its November 1981 stories on battered women in Carlton
County, the News-Tribune said Diesen did not prosecute domestic
abuse cases aggressively.
   Diesen said the articles caused him extreme embarrassment and
humiliation, cost him re-election and made it difficult for him to
earn a living. In 1982, he sued the newspaper, reporter John
Hessburg and former executive editor Thomas Daly.
   The jury found the articles defamatory and concluded that the
newspaper acted with malice by recklessly disregarding the whole
truth.
   But Litman said the eight-person jury erred in concluding that a
false impression arising from factually based articles is libelous.
Litman agreed with the News-Tribune's argument that implications
about Diesen's performance were opinions of the reporter, the
publisher or the articles' sources.
   ``As opinion, it is constitutionally protected,'' the judge said.
   Noting that Diesen was an elected public official, Litman said,
``Any factual account of his performance as county attorney must be
considered within the ample province of First Amendment
protections.''

   A U2 reconnaissance plane
skidded to an emergency landing on a runway Tuesday, but damage was
minor and the pilot was not hurt, the Air Force said.
   A statement said the pilot made a belly landing after the
landing gear failed to come down. He was taken to the Patrick Air
Force Hospital for observation, but officials said he was not
harmed.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Chuck Lutz told Orlando's WCPX-TV Channel 6,
which photographed the U2 after the incident, that the plane
skidded 1,000 to 1,500 feet down the runway. Lutz said damage
appeared to be minor.
   The aircraft was assigned to Detachment 5, 9th Strategic
Reconnaissance Wing, stationed at Patrick Air Force Base.
   ``As a matter of policy,'' an Air Force statement said, ``we
don't discuss specific operations of the U2.'' The statement also
said the names of reconnaissance pilots are not made public.
   The Air Force said it had begun an investigation of the incident.

   Hughes Aircraft Co. of Los Angeles agreed to
pay a $47,500 civil penalty for allegedly violating U.S.
anti-boycott laws by communicating with a Syrian-based organization
regarding a boycott of Israel, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
   Paul Freedenberg, under secretary for export administration,
said that Hughes allegedly sent letters in April and May 1983 to
the Central Office for the Boycott of Israel.
   The letters contained information about Hughes' and other
companies business relationships with Israel and with persons
blacklisted by Arab League countries, most of whom boycott goods
and services from Israel, the department said in a statement.
   In paying the penalty, Hughes neither admitted nor denied guilt.
   U.S. law prohibits Americans from participating in a foreign
boycott not supported by the United States. It also bars U.S.
citizens from supplying information about their own or others'
relationship with boycotted countries friendly to the United States.

   The outcome of last week's City Council
election will be decided Saturday in a re-enactment of how this
town got its name.
   Diane Payne-Lara and Leon Taylor, who tied at 275 votes each,
will meet at high noon and each will draw from a deck of cards
until one picks the deuce of clubs.
   Both candidates, dressed in Western garb and carrying
six-shooters, will meet in the city's 100-year-old jail to re-enact
the fateful card game between Marion Clark and Croyden E. Cooley in
1870.
   According to legend, business partners Clark and Cooley had a
disagreement and decided to dissolve their land venture with a card
game, with the loser selling to the winner.
   After they had played all night, Clark told Cooley, ``You show
low and you win.''
   Cooley cut the cards and came up with the deuce of clubs, giving
the town its name.
   Both candidates said they believed the luck of the draw was a
fair.
   Liz Burke, deputy city clerk, said state law allows a tied
election to be resolved by drawing straws, flipping a coin or
drawing cards, but it doesn't mention a runoff.

   Putting a dummy behind the wheel of a
parked State Patrol car is proving to be a smart idea, patrol
officials say.
   The patrol's Duluth district started putting a mannequin in the
driver's seat of an old patrol car Monday and it will be in use at
least through the busy Memorial Day weekend.
   ``We're doing it to raise the perception of visible law
enforcement,'' said patrol Capt. Eric Gunderson. ``We've taken one
of our units that's about to be traded and parked it in an area of
high volume and high visibility.''
   The mannequin was borrowed from a clothier and dressed in a
patrol uniform.
   On Monday afternoon, the car with the mannequin was parked on
the southbound side of Interstate 35 just past the Superior Street
exit to Duluth. About one in every four motorists applied the
brakes as they approached the car.
   The mannequin won't be spending much time in one spot. Gunderson
plans to move it around daily to areas of high traffic volume or
numerous accidents.
   ``So, the next time you go past a patrol car it might or might
not be a dummy,'' Gunderson said.

   When is a chairman not a chairman? When
he's in this town, whose residents have voted to ban the use of
``man'' to describe offices held by men and women.
   The resolution passed by a sizable majority of the 40 people at
town meeting Monday.
   Among the opponents, however, was Harold T. Mollison, who chairs
Goshen's board of selectpeople. He said Tuesday: ``I'm a selectman
and until the (state) law changes I'm still going to be a
selectman.''
   Because the resolution was not on the warrant for the meeting,
it is non-binding and may be embraced or ignored by each
selectperson or chairperson it affects.
   Former Selectperson Anthony J. Thomas said he liked the idea,
but he believed the title of ``selectman'' should remain as long as
Massachusetts uses it.
   According to Thomas, documents signed by Goshen's newly titled
selectpersons must use the term ``selectmen'' to be legal.
   Deputy Director William Kennedy of the Boston-based
Massachusetts Municipal Association agreed. When people perform
statutory duties, they sign with their statutory title, he said,
even if their town title is different.
   Kennedy added, however, that he doesn't know if that is
tradition or law.

   Full service should be restored by Friday to
nearly half the 35,000 customers whose phones went dead May 8,
after a fire at an Illinois Bell Co. switching center, a company
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   The remaining customers hit by the outage won't get full service
until early June, spokeswoman Pat Montgomery said. Most customers
have had limited service since Friday.
   In Springfield, meanwhile, staff members of the Illinois
Commerce Commission said a detailed investigation into the cause of
the fire would start June 10.
   ``Hopefully, if we get people who know the business and are
experienced in electrical type of fires, I would like to think that
in a matter of weeks we should have something,'' said Jerry Hoppe,
chief ICC engineer.
   On May 8, fire destroyed virtually all the vital hardware at the
Illinois Bell switching center in Hinsdale, west of Chicago.
   The outage has cost businesses untold amounts of money because
of limited long-distance and local phone service, and localities
have been forced to spend thousands of dollars to bolster public
safety since police and fire departments had no means of
communication.
   Hoppe said Illinois Bell can't determine its liability to
customers until the cause of the fire is determined.
   Ms. Montgomery said 250 laborers have been working 12-hour
shifts to get the Hinsdale site in shape.

<HEAD>Proxmire Chides White House On Stock Market Report, Promises Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee
scolded Reagan administration officials Tuesday for offering
``pitiful'' solutions for the stock market's problems, and promised
to press ahead with his own bill.
   Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., used a hearing
called by his panel to lecture the authors of the White House's
latest report on last fall's market crash.
   ``The progress that you have made is pitiful,'' he said of the
group's two months of work.
   ``This working group has been the regulatory equivalent of the
North Carolina Tar Heels basketball strategy called the four
corners offense,'' Proxmire said. ``Pass the ball around and run
out the clock. Never shoot, just stall and run out the clock.''
   The high-ranking administration officials who produced the
report, which was released May 16, advanced several mild steps for
soothing the nation's volatile markets and nervous investors.
   They included a call for an hour-long trading halt in the
nation's stock, futures and options markets if the Dow Jones
Industrial Average plunges by 250 points in a single day. Such a
decline has occurred only once: Last Oct. 19's 508-point drop,
which has triggered on ongoing look at the markets' volatility by
the government and Congress.
   Proxmire introduced legislation March 31 that would establish a
committee consisting of the chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. The committee would oversee issues that affect
all of the nation's markets, such as coordinating margins _ or
downpayments _ exchanged in transactions, and setting up ``circuit
breakers'' to halt trading during emergencies.
   ``My aim ... is to make sure that there is an accountable entity
with both the responsibility and the expertise to make the
decisions on intermarket issues,'' Proxmire said.
   Currently, the CFTC oversees the futures markets, while the SEC
and the Fed share responsibility for the stock and options
exchanges.
   After the hearing, Proxmire told reporters he expected his
committee to send the legislation to the full Senate next month.
   With Congress' schedule abbreviated this year because of the
elections _ and with some lawmakers joining the administration in
opposing strong legislative action on the problem _ it seems
unlikely that any bill will become law in 1988.
   ``It makes it much harder to have the administration opposed,''
Proxmire conceded. ``The president has the veto, and the
administration has influence with many members of Congress.''
   Sentiment on the banking committee toward the need for
legislation seems split, and not along party lines.
   While Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said, ``We'd be darned fools
to say that all is well'' with the financial markets, Sen. John
Shelby D-Ala., said, ``A lot of us here ... don't believe you can
legislate investors' confidence.''
   Treasury Undersecretary George D. Gould, who headed the working
group, expressed frustration with lawmakers' criticisms, saying,
``As you know, I have spent my life in the markets, and I would
like a little credit for some of the insights of 35 years.''
   Also writing the report were Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, CFTC
Chairwoman Wendy Gramm, and SEC Chairman David S. Ruder.
   Ruder has dissented from his colleagues on several points,
arguing that futures margins should be raised and that the SEC
should oversee futures trading. The SEC meets Thursday to fashion
legislative proposals that will be submitted to Congress by next
week.

<TEXT>
   A construction worker has sued Garland and three
of its police officers, alleging he was jailed nearly a month when
his headache powder was mistaken for cocaine.
   Michael Holloway, 37, was arrested on intoxication charges while
visiting his ex-wife in the Dallas suburb in April 1987. He was
charged with drug possession after police said the powder had
tested positive for cocaine, the lawsuit said.
   Holloway said the substance was actually BC powder, an
over-the-counter headache remedy.
   Holloway spent 25 days in the Garland jail before authorities
determined the powder had tested negative upon further examination,
the lawsuit said.
   ``Because of the damage to his reputation and the extreme fear,
frustration, and unshakeable memories of the entire experience,
plaintiff has been in a continual state of fear and depression,''
the lawsuit said.
   Garland Police Chief Jesse Youngblood said police procedures
were followed. An initial test identified the powder as cocaine,
and later testing with more sophisticated procedures determined the
material did not contain the drug.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in state district court, does not
specify damages sought.

<TEXT>
   The operator of a mail-order pornography
business filed suit in federal court here Tuesday to stop the
Justice Department from prosecuting him on obscenity charges in
four states.
   Avram Freedberg, owner of Consumer's Marketing Group Ltd. of
Stamford Conn., is seeking an injunction to prevent the Justice
Department's national obscenity enforcement unit from bringing the
charges in federal courts in Mississippi, Indiana, Utah and
Delaware.
   The suit charges that the effort to prosecute Freedberg, his
wife, Rhoda, and others in the four jurisdictions is merely a
campaign to harass the firm and drive it out of business by forcing
it to incur large legal fees.
   ``Although shielded by the specious pretext that they are
enforcing federal obscenity statutes, defendants are unlawfully and
unconstitutionally preventing plaintiffs from enaging in a legal
occupation,'' said Freedberg's motion for a temporary restraining
order.
   ``Defendants simply disapprove of the content of plaintiff's
promotional materials, magazines, and videotapes, and are
unconstitutionally intimidating plaintiffs with multiple
(simultaneous or consecutive) obscenity prosecutions,'' the suit
said.
   The company has stopped nationwide sales and promotions of
sexually orieented material itemized in five grand jury subpoenas
served earlier this year, the lawsuit said.
   The threatened prosecutions have prompted a number of employees
to quit their jobs. The suit said that ``with no work force, CMG
will eventually cease doing business.''
   The planned prosecutions are part of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III's announced efforts to take legal action against
pornography distributors.
   A Justice Department official in Utah told Freedberg's attorneys
that he would be prosecuted for alleged obscenity violations in all
four districts and additional jurisdictions until a felony
conviction was obtained.
   If federal prosecutions were not successful, Freedberg would
face state obscenity charges as well, the suit said.
   Freedberg was offered an opportunity to plead guilty to two
felony counts in Utah to avoid prosecution elsewhere. Freedburg's
wife and company employees might not be prosecuted if Freedberg
pleaded guilty, but prosecutors would still seek a subtantial
prison term for his convictions, the suit said.
   The lawsuit also charged that Package Fulfillment Center, a
company that fills orders for Freedberg's firm, and its president,
Michael Norberto, have been named as a potential target of the
investigations.

<HEAD>Government Says It Will Evict 1,800 Blacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it
will begin evicting 1,800 blacks next month from a settlement
adjoining the town President P.W. Botha once represented in
Parliament.
   Civil rights workers say the planned evictions from Lawaiicamp
``signify a return to the brutal forced removals of the past.''
   White officials say the 40-year-old black community is an
illegal, unsanitary squatter camp and its actions do not constitute
a forced removal.
   Lawaiicamp is on the outskirts of George, five miles from a
scenic stretch of Indian Ocean coastline east of Cape Town.
   Botha was elected to Parliament from the George constituency in
1948 and represented it until he became South Africa's president in
1984.
   The government wants to move Lawaiicamp residents to Sandkraal,
which is about a mile further from George and was established four
years ago to be the area's official black township.
   George's mayor, John Rogers, said at a news conference Tuesday
that Lawaiicamp residents had until May 31 to move voluntarily. The
town council plans to apply for eviction orders in court on June 1
and to demolish the 180 remaining Lawaiicamp homes once they are
vacated.
   Rogers said evicted families would be paid compensation and
provided with new homes. About 800 families have already moved from
Lawaiicamp to Sandkraal, and the government claims they enjoy
better services and amenities.
   The mayor said violence would not be used against the residents
resisting eviction but he did not explain how this could be assured
in the face of possible defiance.
   The current Parliament member for George, Hennie Smit, said the
matter ``is being handled in an understanding, sympathetic manner.''
   He said Lawaiicamp is illegal because it is on land designated
for use by people of mixed race. A new mixed-race township is to be
developed on the site.
   Last week, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok accused
anti-apartheid organizations of encouraging Lawaiicamp residents to
resist removal.
   He said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other activists
were ``playing with fire'' by stirring up emotions which could ``be
detrimental to public order.''
   In early 1986, the government tried to evict Lawaiicamp
residents but backed off because of legal challenges and stiff
resistance.
   This time, the government says it will not yield. Residents of
Lawaiicamp say they are determined to stay where they are.
   Prominent anti-apartheid clergymen are planning to protest the
government decision this Sunday at a prayer service in George.
Among those scheduled to attend is the Rev. Allen Boesak, a South
African who is president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   From 1950 to 1983, the government forcibly resettled an
estimated 3.5 million people, nearly all of them black. Botha said
in 1984 that there would be no more forced removals, but critics
say the policy continues under different names, such as ``slum
clearance'' and ``squatter control.''
   Botha said last year that he opposed forced removal ``unless it
is accompanied by the provision of better living conditions.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   The State Department has relented and given
permission to one of Vietnam's leading economic policy-makers to
visit the United States, Rep. Chester G. Atkins and the American
Civil Liberties Union said Tuesday.
   Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a member of Vietnam's national assembly and an
advocate of economic liberalization, originally was denied entry
into the United States under a law permitting the State Department
to bar foreigners on grounds of national interest.
   Oanh, 66, a U.S.-trained economist who has held high-ranking
positions in both the U..S.-backed administration in South Vietnam
and the communist government that unified Vietnam in 1975, applied
in March to come to the United States to speak at Harvard and other
universities.
   The department has sought to limit visits by Vietnamese,
particularly those involved in the economy, to keep Vietnam in
economic isolation as long as it maintains an estimated 120,000
troops in neighboring Cambodia. The United States has had no
diplomatic relations with Vietnam since 1975.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the department changed its mind on Oanh because recent legal
rulings prohibit the widespread use of ``national interest'' under
the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act to deny visas.
   Atkins, a Massachusetts Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said, ``The State Department's original indication that
it would deny him a visa under the misbegotten McCarran-Walter Act
was a mistake, and I am gratified that the administration has
changed its mind.''
   Atkins said Oanh is ``an advocate of moving his country out of
its economic isolation and toward some limited free-market
policies.''
   He and seven other members of Congress said in a letter to
Secretary of State George P. Shultz that despite U.S.
non-recognition of the Vietnamese government ``it is possible and
we believe healthy to understand some of the latest policy
developments there.''
   ``Dr. Oanh is a very sophisticated, highly trained academic who
is likely to take back some very keen insights about the United
States,'' the legislators said. ``Allowing a few tentative steps
toward an academic exchange can only suggest the possibilities that
one day would accrue to Vietnam once impediments to normalization
are resolved.''
   Kate Martin, director of the ACLU's national security litigation
project, said her group was involved on Oanh's behalf with the
State Department legal office.
   The United States has hinged improvements in relations with
Vietnam on withdrawal from Cambodia and the best possible
accounting for the estimated 1,700 Americans still listed as
missing from the Vietnam War.
   The next opportunity for a high-level U.S.-Vietnamese meeting
will come in early June, when Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach
comes to New York to attend a United Nations disarmament conference.
   There were no plans for any U.S. official of equal or near-equal
rank to meet Thach, although a session is expected between Thach
and retired Gen. John W. Vessey, who is President Reagan's special
representative on behalf of the missing U.S. servicemen.

<HEAD>Advocacy Group Contends EPA Allows Too Much Lead in Grapefruit
Juice</HEAD>

   The Environmental Protection Agency has
permitted lead concentrations in fresh Florida grapefruit juice 20
times what it permits in drinking water, according to an advocacy
group critical of the agency's pesticide decisions.
   The lead arises from the use of lead arsenate to accelerate the
ripening of grapefruit so farmers can ship them to market in
September and October. Normally, Florida grapefruit would not be
available until November.
   The last federal license to sell lead arsenate was surrendered
earlier this year by the manufacturer, Micro-Flo Co. of Lakeland,
Fla., rather than conduct more tests that EPA said were needed for
its 10-year-old review of arsenic-based pesticides.
   In return for surrendering the license, the company was
permitted to sell remaining inventories. Up to 100,000 pounds per
year have been used recently, enabling growers to earn almost $10
million a year in extra profits by sending fruit to market early,
according to EPA estimates.
   The National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides said it
believed there was enough lead arsenate in Florida distribution
channels to serve growers for another two years.
   ``It is irresponsible for EPA to stand by and allow the
application of this material,'' Jay be treated
firmly, so that he cannot involve non-users and so that his own
drug use ceases.''
   The cry for legalization comes not because Americans want to
accept the costs of drug use but ``because some are afraid we
cannot win this fight and that the cost of maintaining the war
against drugs has become too great,'' Bennett said. ``In too many
places we now have what amounts to de facto legalization of drugs.
   ``If we now legalize drugs we should not deceive ourselves that
education and treatment programs will then be sufficient
effectively to minimize drug use and its consequences,'' Bennett
said. ``That simply won't work.
   ``Legalizing drugs would be so stark a moral surrender in the
war on drugs that it would tear the essential foundation out from
under drug education programs. They would not be effective. And we
cannot expect treatment programs to repair the damage.''

   An explosion caused by a gas leak
ignited a fire today at a storage tank complex and forced
evacuation of tens of thousands of people in this northern city,
the Pemex oil company and the government news agency reported.
   There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries, the Red
Cross and the company said. Witnesses said the column of fire and
smoke rose more than 150 feet into the air and was visible
throughout the flat city.
   The Notimex news agency estimated that 200,000 people were
evacuated. It earlier quoted Mario Perez, commander of the fire
department, as saying soldiers, police and volunteers moved more
than 100,000 people from a radius of two miles from the plant.
   Reporters at the newspaper Novedades de Chihuahua estimated
20,000 people were evacuated. The differing reports could not be
reconciled immediately.
   Pemex headquarters in Mexico City said in its initial report
that a tank with capacity for 30,000 barrels of petroleum
derivatives exploded at 11:20 a.m.
   Notimex quoted the fire department's official report as saying
the cause of the fire was a gas leak followed by a spark.
   Olga Rojo, the Red Cross' radio operator, said the effort to
control the blaze was hampered by a shortage of water. Much of
northern Mexico is suffering from drought this season.
   The storage tank facility is about eight miles north of the
center of the city. Notimex said plans had called for the storage
tanks to be relocated some months ago, but the new facilities have
not been completed. Neighbors had been protesting Pemex's presence
in the area, it said.
   Chihuahua, capital of sprawling Chihuahua state, is 233 miles
south of the Texas border at El Paso. Its population is about
550,000.

   Sikh radicals killed 10 people in Punjab
state Tuesday, including six members of a Hindu family, and police
killed four Sikh gunmen, Indian news agencies reported.
   Press Trust of India said the Hindu family members were killed
after volunteer guards in Dhariwal village in the Jalandhar
district exchanged fire with six gunmen who arrived on motorcycles.
The village is about 50 miles southeast of Amritsar, the Sikh holy
city.
   One guard and two children were seriously wounded, the agency
said.
   Radical separatists have fought a campaign of murder and terror
since 1982 for a separate Sikh nation in Punjab, a rich
agricultural state in the northwest where the sect has a majority.
Thousands of people have been killed.
   A dispatch from United News of India said police killed four
Sikh separatists Tuesday in two encounters in the Faridkot and
Bhatinda districts.
   Among the victims was Chamkaur Singh, who was wanted by police
for several murders. A cash award of 50,000 rupees ($3,850) had
been posted for him.
   The other killings by Sikh gunmen occurred in the Amritsar,
Gurdashpur and Jalandhar districts.
   Police report at least 1,163 people killed by the extremists in
Punjab so far this year, more than the 1,030 slain in all of 1987.
   Sikhism was founded 500 years ago as an alternative to Hinduism
and Islam. Its adherents make up less than 2 percent of India's 800
million people and claim discrimination by Hindus, who account for
82 percent.

   State officials began efforts Tuesday to
take control of the troubled Jersey City schools, citing rampant
political patronage, mismanaged schools and a chronic failure to
educate the district's 32,000 students.
   It is believed it would be the first time a state has taken over
such a large urban district.
   Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman said his decision to seek
control of the district, New Jersey's second-largest, is based on
results of separate, yearlong investigations by independent
auditors and state officials.
   ``Political patronage, union pressure and cronyism is a
consistent motivation, at all levels, in the hiring, firing and
promoting of staff,'' Cooperman said in his formal notice of
takeover plans.
   The auditor's report cites ``a state of managerial bankruptcy''
in the district and a ``disorganized and dysfunctional''
administration. Both reports were highly critical of the school
district, from the local board of education and top level
administrators to school principals.
   Assistant Education Commissioner Walter McCarroll said the
probes revealed an ``overwhelming failure'' by the district to
provide an education to its largely poor, inner-city student
population.
   Cooperman concluded that district administrators were incapable
of properly running the schools or fixing widespread problems.
   If Cooperman's seizure of the district is successful, it would
mark the first such takeover of such a large urban district,
according to the National Governor's Association. The
Washington-based group has been monitoring the growing movement by
states to obtain more power to take control of districts deemed
failures at educating children.
   Under New Jersey legislation enacted five months ago, Cooperman
could abolish the local board of education, fire the superintendent
and top administrators and appoint a state superintendent to
operate the schools for at least five years. The law gives New
Jersey officials some of the broadest powers in the nation to take
control of deficient districts.
   The auditors also found inadequate record keeping, missing
contract documents, questionable payroll and personnel practices
and unsecured contract procedures. They also said the district has
wasted more than $1.2 million on an improper health insurance plan.
   Richard Kaplan, who ran the state investigation, said employees
are routinely rewarded or demoted based upon which mayoral
candidates they back in the Democratic stronghold.
   ``Principals are not in control of their buildings, and students
and teachers are often not found where they are assigned and not
focused on instructional purposes,'' said the auditor's report.
   Teachers weren't optimistic that state control would spell an
end to the district's problems.
   Mike Bogart, a grammar school teacher at Public School 24, said
that, over time, rules have been forgotten and replaced with double
standards.
   ``We can't come back, but I guess we've got to try,'' Bogart
said.
   The investigator's findings have been referred to the state
Division of Criminal Justice to determine if there have been any
criminal actions.
   Cooperman went to court Monday for an emergency order giving him
veto power over personnel and fiscal matters in the district.
McCarroll said the action was taken to maintain the ``status quo''
as the takeover dispute is resolved. A hearing on the state's
request for veto power is scheduled for June 7.
   Cooperman's action, signed Monday, gives the district 10 days to
accept the decision or reply.
   If local officials fight, the matter will go before an
administrative law judge. Cooperman must then decide whether to ask
the state Board of Education to issue an order taking over the
district.
   Superintendent Franklin Williams has said that if the district
was properly funded, the state would not need to take it over.
   He also has said conditions are not as bad as the state
maintains. Many problems, he said, stem from a high crime rate,
drug problems and poverty among students, many of whom are homeless
or do not speak English.
   But Cooperman disagreed: ``The facts are stubborn things. I
would respectfully disagree with the superintendent.''
   Mayor Anthony Cucci said he welcomed the state intervention but
said he wants to know who will pay any additional costs.
   ``A constant source of concern is finance,'' Cucci said, adding
that school conditions had improved since he took office in July
1985. ``You can't leave the financial things aside. I refuse to
surrender that point.''
   Leslie Silberman, a spokeswoman for the Jersey City Board of
Education, said the panel would not comment on Cooperman's
recommendation until they had time to read the report.

<TEXT>
   Federally mediated hearings opened Tuesday to
settle a bitter dispute between airline unions and Texas Air Corp.
over whether the company's two subsidiaries _ Continental and
Eastern airlines _ should be considered a single airline for
bargaining purposes.
   The issue is important for the unions because neither pilots nor
mechanics at Continental Airlines are unionized, while both groups
have militant union organizations at Eastern Airlines.
   Texas Air Corp. contends that while it owns both Eastern and
Continental, the subsidiaries remain independent air carriers and
should have separate dealings with labor.
   The first day of hearings before Roland Watkins, a hearing
officer for the National Mediation Board, began as about 120
Continental pilots staged a protest across the street from the
board's headquarters because they have not been allowed to
participate in the proceedings.
   ``We don't want to be railroaded by this,'' complained Rick
Swanson, who has been a Continental pilot for six years and is a
leader in a Continental employee group called ``Continental by
Choice.''
   A spokesman for the group, Carter Smith, said a total of about
400 pilots, flight attendants, reservation clerks, mechanics and
other Continental employees also participated in the various
demonstrations.
   The pilots later marched to the headquarters of the Air Line
Pilots Association where they also set up protest pickets. ALPA,
which represents 40,000 commercial pilots, has led the fight to get
the Continental and Eastern work force under a single bargaining
system.
   In Tuesday's testimony, the pilots union argued that Texas Air
``asserts centralized control'' over both airlines and ``exercises
close control over the management of both Eastern and Continental,
particularly with respect to labor relations.''
   It cited as examples in support of its argument Texas Air's
recent arrangement to provide $22.5 million to Eastern in event of
a strike. The union also noted other joint agreements between the
two airlines in the transferring of assets, the sharing of sales
forces and integration of its frequent flyer programs.
   Joseph Manson, an attorney for Texas Air Corp., sought
unsuccessfully at the beginning of the hearing to have the
proceedings stopped, arguing that the board had no jurisdiction
over the matter.
   ``The unions have one and only one purpose and that is to
destroy Eastern instead of addressing the real problems (at
Eastern)'' Manson said. He called the petition by ALPA and other
unions representing flight attendants and mechanics at Eastern
``another media event.''
   It's not known how long the proceedings before Watkins will
take, but the three-member board has reserved time into late June
for a series of hearings. The board is not likely to consider the
case until mid- or late summer.

   The City Council has approved a bill that
protects homosexuals from discrimination, ending a struggle that
lasted eight years.
   Mayor Kurt Schmoke, who supported the measure, has said he would
sign the bill when it reaches his desk.
   The bill was opposed by Roman Catholic Bishop William Borders.
   Similar bills have been enacted in New York, Atlanta,
Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.
   For the most part, the final debate on the measure lacked the
intensity and emotion that accompanied the council's earlier
dealings with the proposal.
   The thunderous applause that greeted the 12-7 vote was an
indication of the long struggle to adopt an ordinance to outlaw
discrimination against homosexuals in housing, employment,
education, health and welfare services.
   Similar bills were defeated in 1980 and 1985.
   ``I hope this is the last time we have to address human rights
in this city,'' said Councilwoman Vera Hall.
   Meanwhile, a controversial gay rights bill, which is entering
its 16th year before the Massachusetts Legislature, advanced
Tuesday on the narrowest of committee votes.
   The Senate Ways and Means Committee endorsed the bill to ban
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by a vote of 7-6.
   The bill now goes to the Senate's Steering and Policy Committee,
which held the bill for 42 days of its 45-day maximum limit last
year.
   The legislation passed the House and won a majority in the
Senate last year, but then got hung up in a committee.

<HEAD>Report Says Soviets Will Grant Visas To Israeli Diplomats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has agreed to grant visas to
Israeli diplomats for the first time in 21 years and will issue
them after next week's superpower summit in Moscow, three Israeli
news reports said Tuesday.
   Israel radio and television and the Maariv daily said Israeli
and Soviet diplomats reached the agreement at a weekend meeting in
Zurich, Switzerland.
   A Foreign Ministry official, reached by telephone, said of the
reports: ``They are not true.''
   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
that meetings took place in Zurich between Nimrod Novick, a Foreign
Ministry political adviser, and Vladimir Terrasov, deputy head of
the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Middle East Department.
   ``There was progress, but it's little and slow,'' the official
said of the meetings. He declined to elaborate.
   Moscow broke diplomatic ties with Israel during the 1967 Middle
East War.
   According to the reports, the Soviets agreed to allow five
Israeli diplomats to travel to Moscow to handle the issuing of
visas to Soviet Jewish emigrants who now are processed through the
Dutch Embassy in Moscow.
   None of the reports gave a date for the visit.
   The reports come at a time when Kremlin leaders are seeking a
greater role in the Middle East, including participation in a
proposed international conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Israeli leaders are divided over such a conference. Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres, head of the left-of-center Labor Party,
favors it. His coalition partner, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of
the right-wing Likud bloc, is opposed.
   Soviet leaders have improved relations with Israel in the last
two years by holding meetings with Israelis abroad and by
increasing the flow of Jewish emigration to the Jewish state.
   Last year, Israel permitted an eight-member Soviet consular
delegation to visit Israel. Some of these diplomats are still
conducting consular duties from the Finnish Embassy in Tel Aviv.
   Shamir indirectly referred to the contacts in remarks to
reporters Tuesday.
   ``I think there is no doubt Israel has all desire and reasons to
live in peace and maintain ties with the Soviet Union,'' Shamir
said. ``We always wanted friendly relations with the Soviet Union,
a superpower, because our (Jewish) brothers live there and we want
to discuss with the Russians their fate.''

   After a half-century of touting
physical fitness, Jack LaLanne is still flexing his muscles without
a thought of retirement.
   ``Retirement! Geez. That's what Forest Lawn (mortuary) wants.
Retire and they get ya,'' the 73-year-old health guru said in a
recent interview from his coastal home 170 miles northwest of Los
Angeles.
   ``I don't care how long I live, I want to live while I'm

   Up at 5 a.m., LaLanne's daily ritual includes two hours of
pumping iron and stretching and an hour of exercise in the pool.
Then, he indulges in a blender concoction of nonfat milk, apple
juice, a banana and three packages of his own brand of
strawberry-flavored protein powder.
   With the frothy mixture, the one-time TV exercise personality
swallows about 100 vitamin and mineral supplements.
   But LaLanne isn't bent on force-feeding his philosophy.
   ``One of my best friends weighs about 300 pounds, drinks a quart
of booze a day and smokes like a fiend,'' he said. ``I'll light
someone's cigarettes for them. This bull about changing people _
you never change people. Accept 'em. accept 'em, accept 'em!''

<HEAD>Higher Expenses, Lower Federal Payments To Dampen 1988 Farm Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rise in production expenses and a decline in
federal payments continue to bear on 1988 farm income prospects, an
Agriculture Department report said Tuesday.
   Net cash income of farmers is forecast at $50 billion to $55
billion this year, down from the record of $57 billion in 1987, the
report said. That is unchanged from USDA's previous forecasts.
   The department's Economic Research Service added that underlying
the forecast are improvements in several of agriculture's key
fundamentals:
   _Use of most of the major commodities has increased, thereby
reducing burdensome stockpiles.
   _Market prices for those commodities are approaching or are
higher than the government's support levels.
   _Higher cattle prices have offset minor declines in production.
   _Interest rates have continued to be moderate.
   _Total farm debt is declining for the fifth consecutive year,
indicating further gains in the financial position of operators.
   ``Production expenses are expected to rise, after declining at
an unprecedented rate the last three years,'' the report said.
   Spring fertilizer prices were up 10 percent from a year ago, and
those ``will be felt most by corn and barley producers, whose
outlays for fertilizer make up 38 percent and 30 percent,
respectively, of variable costs,'' the report said. ``The Corn Belt
will be the region most affected.''
   Energy expenses may rise about 5 percent this year, with cash
grain, and cattle and hog operations accounting for more than 60
percent of fuel costs last year. Again, the Corn Belt will be most
affected.
   Thus the drop in 1988 net cash income _ the difference between
gross cash income and cash expenses _ will be mostly due to higher
cash expenses outweighing greater cash receipts from the sale of
crops and livestock.
   Further, the report said, direct payments to farmers in 1988 are
expected to drop by as much as 20 percent from last year's $17
billion.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To Restrict Use Of Boat-Hull Paint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday passed and sent to
President Reagan legislation to restrict the use of a popular
boat-hull paint that is effective against marine organisms like
barnacles but which poses environmental risks.
   The bill, approved by voice vote, would ban the use of paints
containing organic tin additives on non-aluminum hull vessels less
than 82 feet long. The most widely used additive is tributyltin, or
TBT.
   The measure would permit continued use of such paints on large
vessels and those with aluminum hulls so long as the organic tin
compounds are not released into the water at more than 4 micrograms
per square centimeter a day.
   Paints with organic tin are much more effective against
barnacles and marine algae than copper-based paints, meaning lower
maintenance costs for boat owners. Copper-based paints corrode
aluminum surfaces.
   Releases into the water from copper-based paints become
non-toxic almost immediately, but organic tin additives can remain
toxic for up to six months, according to the House Merchant Marine
and Fisheries Committee.
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., says that England and France have
regulated organic tin marine paints because they have damaged
shellfish beds. He says that while their effects on humans are not
known, high levels of TBT have been found in chinook salmon in this
country.

<HEAD>British Arms Dealers Convicted Of Trying To Swindle Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Britons who claimed they worked with former
White House aide Oliver North in the Iran-Contra arms deal were
convicted Tuesday of trying to swindle Iran with a fake consignment
of anti-tank missiles.
   A jury at the Old Bailey criminal court rejected their claim of
being part of the American operation and found them guilty of
conspiring to sell Iran 5,000 TOW anti-tank missiles that did not
exist.
   Michael Aspin, 50, the group's leader, was sentenced to six
years in prison. He testified in the 4{-month trial that the CIA
and U.S. Customs Special Investigations Office knew about the deal
for 34 million pounds ($63.6 million) worth of missiles.
   Eric Matson, 63, a retired army officer who later served as a
colonel in the United Arab Emirates, was sentenced to three years
in prison and insurance broker William Harper, 38, got two years. A
fourth defendent, businessman John Taylor, 56, was acquitted.
   The men were arrested after Swiss middlemen acting for the
Iranian buyers became suspicious and called police in 1986 after
having delivered several thousand dollars to Aspin.
   Aspin, who was convicted of gun-running to South Africa in 1982,
claimed he had two meetings with Lt. Col. North at London hotels in
February and September 1985 and said North promised to arrange the
supply of TOW missiles.
   North awaits trial on charges arising from a plan, exposed in
1986, to sell arms to Iran and divert funds from the sales to
Nicaraguan rebels. U.S. hostages in Lebanon were to be freed in
exchange for the arms sales to Iran, according to the plan.
   Judge John Alliott said in passing sentence the Britons had no
connection with Iran-Contra and concocted the story in an attempt
to conceal ``persistent and deliberate fraud.''
   He told Aspin: ``You are a rogue and the mainspring of this
conspiracy.''

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis denounced
President Reagan's veto of a major trade bill Tuesday, saying it
was ``unconscionable'' to oppose requiring advance notice of plant
closings.
   ``Any administration that is willing to give General (Manuel)
Noriega 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to
give the American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out
on the street,'' Dukakis said.
   He was referring to the bill's advance-notice provision and to
reports that the administration is considering dropping drug
charges against the Panamanian leader in order to persuade him to
relinquish power.
   The Massachusetts governor spent Tuesday tending to state duties
in advance of a Wednesday trip to Washington, where campaign aides
said he would pick up endorsements from a dozen members of
Congress, including five senators and a handful of House members
from California. He will also meet with Sen. Albert Gore Jr., a
former presidential candidate who still has nearly 400 delegates.
   The new round of ``super delegate'' endorsements are part of
Dukakis' campaign strategy to line up enough delegates prior to the
June 7 primaries in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana
to guarantee a mathematical lock on the nomination if he wins in
those states.
   Dukakis aides have said the Reagan trade-bill veto would give
him a strong economic issue to use in the expected fall campaign
against Vice President George Bush.
   Massachusetts has a state law that encourages companies to give
90-day advance notice of plant closings and major layoffs. It
includes sanctions against companies that refuse to comply.
   In a campaign statement, Dukakis tied Bush to the veto, saying
Reagan and Bush ``don't understand that for working families who
struggle to pay the mortgage, save for their children's education
and care for their elders, there is nothing more painful than
losing a job.''
   ``I think the president is making a very serious mistake. This
is a good trade bill. It's a responsible bill. It's been passed by
the Congress with broad bipartisan support. ... To veto this bill
because it will give working people and their families 60 days'
notice before they're laid off, seems to me to be unconscionable,''
he said.
   Also on Tuesday, Dukakis urged a legislative committee to
toughen state criminal sentencing guidelines and lengthen the
mandatory license suspension for motorists convicted of drunken
driving.
   The governor arranged to collect a dozen or more endorsements
from members of Congress on Wednesday as he sought to ensure enough
delegate support to clinch the nomination by the time the primary
season ends on June 7.
   Campaign and congressional aides, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the list includes Sens. Quentin Burdick of North
Dakota, Wendell Ford of Kentucky, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, John
Breaux of Louisiana and Harry Reid of Nevada. Several members of
the California House delegation also are expected to announce their
support, including Reps. Esteban Torres, Fortney H. ``Pete'' Stark,
Anthony C. Beilenson, Tom Lantos and Leon Panetta, as are a handful
of House members from other parts of the country.
   Officials also said Sen. George Mitchell of Maine is expected to
endorse Dukakis on Friday, perhaps with Rep. Joseph Brennan and
other Maine delegates.
   Also on Wednesday, Dukakis will meet privately with defeated
rival Gore, whose press spokesman, Mike Kopp, said the meeting was
scheduled at the request of Dukakis.
   ``There are no plans for an endorsement,'' Kopp said.
   Gore has nearly 400 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, and he has tried to keep them even though he dropped
out of the presidential race in April following the New York
primary. More than 30 have defected in the past month, according to
an Associated Press count.
   The latest Associated Press delegate count has Dukakis with
1,668, leaving him 413 short of the 2,081 needed for nomination.
   Dukakis' remaining Democratic rival, Jesse Jackson, has
complained that Dukakis is unfairly padding his delegate lead with
super delegates _ party leaders and elected officials who by virtue
of their positions are delegates to the Democratic National
Convention.
   But Dukakis aides said they planned to step up their efforts to
get super delegate endorsements to make it certain that Dukakis
locks up the nomination with the final primaries, when 466
delegates will be chosen.

<HEAD>Rains Brought Temporary Relief To Parched Areas, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rains last month brought temporary relief to
many parched areas of the West where the outlook for this summer's
water supply had been poor, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   ``While drought continues in many areas, it certainly is good to
see an increase in rainfall,'' said Wilson Scaling, chief of the
department's Soil Conservation Service. ``We're hoping this change
will develop into a long-term pattern.''
   Scaling said precipitation in April was near to above normal in
most areas west of the Rocky Mountains. The Columbia Basin got
above-normal precipitation, and Arizona received twice its April
average.
   ``Reservoir storage is very good in the Colorado and Rio Grande
basins,'' he said. ``We also expect reservoirs in Arizona and New
Mexico to fill.''
   But Scaling said the water supply outlook in other areas is not
nearly so bright.
   ``Some areas in Montana will be facing water supply shortages as
early as next month,'' he said. ``There are also sections of
California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho and Washington that remain very
dry despite the recent increase in precipitation.''
   Scaling added: ``It's going to take a lot more than just one
good month of precipitation to ease the drought in those areas.''

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday upheld the
National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's refusal to
reopen an investigation of alleged safety defects in 1966-1979 Ford
cars.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
ruled 2-1 that it did not have the jurisdiction to review NHTSA's
regulation that permitted consideration of non-safety factors in
deciding whether to conduct an investigation.
   ``While safety is an indispensable element of the decision not
to investigate, NHTSA can and does consider such `nonsafety'
factors as its available resources, enforcement priorities, the
likelihood of uncovering sufficient evidence to establish the
existence of a defect, and the prospect of ultimately succeeding in
any necessary enforcement litigation,'' the court said.
   These factors are not reviewable by a court because they are
within the agency's discretion, Judges Abner Mikva and Harry
Edwards said in a joint opinion.
   The decision reversed an earlier ruling by the same court that
the Center for Auto Safety could seek judicial review of the
agency's refusal to reopen the case involving Ford transmissions
that have a tendency to slip into reverse gear.
   In one of the last acts of the Carter administration, the
Transportation Department decided against recalling any of the
allegedly unsafe cars, opting instead to order placement of warning
stickers on the dashboards of the vehicles.
   Chief Judge Patricia Wald, writing in dissent, said ``a review
of the agency's past published decisions under this regulation
demonstrates that in fact it has always relied on safety and remedy
factors, not on the resources factors ... though unsuitable for
judicial review.''
   Wald noted that the agency's stated reasons for denying the
center's petition ``at no point rely on agency resources or
priorities.''
   Clarence Ditlow III, executive director of the consumer activist
group, said there still were 8 million cars with the allegedly
defective transmissions on the road.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department on Tuesday dismissed a
published report that Pakistan had test fired a missile capable of
carrying a nuclear warhead.
   ``I certainly don't have any evidence (of that), and all the
people I've talked to report likewise,'' said Dan Howard, the
Pentagon's chief spokesman, when asked about the report in The New
York Times.
   ``There is no indication, evidence or otherwise that the Paks
have done anything like that.''
   The Times reported Tuesday it had been told by a Pakistani
source with close ties to the government that a missile was
launched at a test range in the Thar Desert on April 25, and that
it was capable of reaching the Indian cities of Bombay and New
Delhi.
   The newspaper quoted the source as saying the missile was of
``home design'' but produced with the help of Chinese experts. It
said a Reagan administration official, who asked not to be
identified, confirmed that such a test firing had been conducted.
   Pakistan is widely reported to have the capability of building
nuclear weapons, or to be close to it. Such reports have been
circulating since late April, when India announced it had developed
a long-range missile.
   Neighboring India exploded an atomic device in 1974.
   Moslem Pakistan and Hindu India have fought each other three
times since they became separate nations in 1947.
   Howard reiterated the Reagan administration view that the
Pakistanis ``have not produced any nuclear weapons.''
   A senior Pakistani Defense Ministry official, meantime, speaking
in Islamabad on condition of anonymity, said of the Times report:
``I have no information whether or not such a missile exists.''
   The Times' story appeared as Pakistani Defense Secretary Syed
Ijlal Zaidi opened consultations with U.S. officials here by
visiting Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci at the Pentagon.
   Howard said he did not know if the topic of missile experiments
had surfaced during Tuesday's talks, which were said to focus on
U.S. military aid, military cooperation between the two countries
and a review of ``regional political perspectives.''

   Helen Geron considers herself resourceful.
As a homeless mother, she has to be.
   ``I take care of my children the best way I can,'' said Ms.
Geron, a mother of six and grandmother of two, and a participant in
a two-week retreat for members of the National Union of the
Homeless.
   ``I'm very resourceful,'' Ms. Geron said. ``I don't let nobody
walk over me. And my kids are that way too.''
   Ms. Geron traveled to Philadelphia from Albuquerque, N.M., last
week. She is one of about a dozen homeless mothers here for the
retreat, all members of the homeless union, an activist group with
chapters in 14 states.
   During the retreat, participants are making plans to for further
takeovers of abandoned housing, a protest tactic that the union has
used in the past.
   Ms. Geron and others attending the retreat said ``safety net''
programs have not helped them solve their problems.
   ``We don't want to be taken care of,'' Ms. Geron said. ``I am a
human being and I need to work.''
   The challenge of caring for children when you can barely care
for yourself is a taxing one, according to several of the mothers.
   ``It's a dual responsibility and a dual fight,'' said Sonya
Terry, 28, who gave birth to a son two months ago while she was
living in a shelter in Detroit.
   ``Michael is my only natural child on this earth,'' she said.
``And, I didn't have a place of my own _ a home for him. I went
through a period of being very depressed.''
   The women said they receive AFDC stipends, but find the money
inadequate for maintaining a family, especially if an eviction,
fire or other mishap leaves them without an apartment or house.
   ``I put the blame for being homeless on myself,'' said LeAnn
Hummel, a 32-year-old from Portland, Ore., whose children are 10
and 13. She said the emotional effect of being homeless knocked her
off balance for a time.
   ``Now my children have been kidnapped _ taken from me by their
father,'' she added. ``I don't know when I will ever see them
again.''
   Barbara Range, 34, said she too has lost custody of her child, a
10-year-old girl, after she first became homeless five years ago.
   ``I lost my self-esteem,'' she said. ``I victimized myself and
abused my child.''
   The life of a homeless woman is harsh even without having to
care for her children, Ms. Hummel said.
   ``There is this area in Portland where a lot of homeless people
hang out,'' she said. ``And the cops come around there and they
treat you like you are nothing. I've been hauled into jail five
times in four months.''

<HEAD>Britain Plans Voluntary AIDS Testing of Pregnant Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain plans to screen up to 90,000 pregnant
women for AIDS to track the spread of the disease, health officials
said Tuesday.
   Sir Donald Acheson, the government's chief medical officer, said
the voluntary program would begin this summer and last one year.
   Pregnant women attending prenatal clinics in three regions will
be asked to submit to blood tests for AIDS, Acheson said. Officials
hope to screen between 60,000 and 90,000 women, he added.
   He said that only women who give consent will be screened.
   Health Minister Tony Newton said, however, that if the program
fails to attract enough volunteers, it might be necessary to carry
out anonymous tests ``without specific consent.''
   ``In view of ... the difficult ethical and legal issues
associated with such testing, we consider it right that the issue
should be the subject of further and wider public debate,'' Newton
said.
   Blood tests can detect the presence of antibodies to the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. A positive
result indicates exposure to the virus but does not necessarily
mean a person will develop AIDS.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's natural
immunity to infections and certain cancers and is invariably fatal.
In Western Europe and the United States, male homosexuals and
intravenous drug abusers are most at risk.
   AIDS is transmitted by sexual contact and through the exchange
of blood, including that which can occur with needle-sharing among
drug addicts. It can also be passed from a woman to her baby before
or at childbirth.
   Acheson said in a television interview that the government hoped
large-scale screening of pregnant women would give a better
indication of the spread of AIDS in Britain, and might be
advantageous to the women themselves.
   As of the end of April, Britain had recorded 1,463 cases of
AIDS, including 839 fatal cases.
   The screening plan was drawn up by a committee of the Public
Health Laboratory Service, which issued a report Tuesday through
the Department of Health and Social Security.
   Dr. Joe Smith, the committee chief, said pregnant women found to
be carriers of the AIDS virus could be counseled about having an
abortion or about the possible risks of breast feeding.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Tuesday
there is ``no softening whatsoever'' of the Reagan administration's
zero tolerance anti-drug policy, despite modifications under which
the Coast Guard will be more cautious about seizing boats outside
the 12-mile limit.
   Under the administration's zero tolerance policy, law
enforcement agencies are cracking down on illegal drug use, no
matter how small the amount.
   With the new changes, however, vessels outside the 12-mile limit
found to be containing drugs will be seized only when there is
evidence of intent to smuggle them into the United States.
   ``I think that whenever you have a new policy there has to be
kind of a running-in period where you look at the practical
difficulties,'' Meese told reporters. ``There have been some
operational refinements, but the policy remains the same.''
   ``Zero tolerance continues to be our policy both inside and
outside the 12-mile limit,'' Meese said. But the attorney general
acknowledged that federal law ``outside 12 miles does relate to
quantities of narcotics indicating an intent to traffic in or
smuggle.''
   Meese emphasized that ``within the applicable laws, small
quantities of narcotics are not going to be ignored as has
occasionally been the situation in the past.''
   Meese said that in terms of forfeiture of boats on which
narcotics are found, law enforcement officials would be more
lenient in a case in which narcotics are concealed in a passenger's
suitcase without the knowledge of the ship's officers and tougher
in a seizure of narcotics ``under ... control of officers.''
   Meese said that there is ``no softening whatsoever'' in the
administration's zero tolerance policy, ``not at all. We're making
sure that the implementation of the zero tolerance policy conforms
to the law and the rules of evidence.''
   Meanwhile, President Reagan asked congressional leaders for help
in creating his suggested bipartisan task force on drugs and named
four top advisers to represent him on the board.
   Reagan named chief of staff Howard Baker, Treasury Secretary
James Baker, Meese and National Security advisor Colin Powell to
the panel.
   Reagan, in a speech at the Coast Guard Academy last week, called
for the formation of the bipartisan task force to coordinate the
fight against illegal drug use. He asked that the task force lay
out its proposals in a report to him and the congressional
leadership within 45 days.
   
   The zero tolerance approach in drug enforcement actions has
brought sharp criticism as a result of several highly publicized
seizures in which expensive yachts were taken when only small
amounts of a drug were found.
   Officials in San Diego recently seized the Atlantis II, which
was used in exploring the wreck of the Titanic, after a crewman was
found with a small amount of marijuana. The vessel is owned by the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.
   The Coast Guard also confiscated a $2.5 million yacht, the Ark
Royal, after less than one-tenth of an ounce of marijuana was found
on board during a search off the Yucatan Peninsula.
   Colleen O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the new guidelines reflect a softening of
administration policy and likely stems from sharp criticsm of the
zero tolerance program.
   ``The idea of seizing million-dollar yachts for small quantities
of marijuana had nothing to do with what the administration
intended for its war on crime,'' said Ms. O'Connor. ``What this
says to me is they have been burned by their own publicity.''

   Education Secretary William J. Bennett on
Tuesday endorsed a national survey's finding that parents _ no
matter what their socioeconomic background _ believe in the
importance of reading.
   ``In this important survey we found out that parents regard
reading and reading to their children as a very important
activity,'' Bennett told a news conference.
   ``The interesting thing is the fact that we see agreement among
all parents, fathers and mothers, rich and poor, black and white
parents. There is no difference, no disagreement about the
importance of reading,'' he said.
   The national telephone survey of 1,000 people, conducted in
February by the Roper Organization, contacted parents of children
ages 3-14. The survey results were based on evaluations of one
child in each household.
   Although the survey said only half the parents contacted
reported that their children were very interested in reading, and
less than half said their child reads for pleasure every day,
Bennett maintained that this too was part of parental
responsibility.
   ``Mothers and fathers should read to their children as early as
possible to teach them that it's just plain fun,'' he said.
   The survey found that how much children read is directly related
to their parents' educational background and reading habits. But it
said the high value placed on reading cut across parents of all
educational backgrounds and demographic groups.
   ``Parents with less education ... may not possess the knowledge
or skill to help their children read,'' the survey said. ``However,
they do not diminish in any way the value of reading, nor do they
lack the desire to help their children become better readers. This
provides a solid ground for optimism about the future.''
   The release of the survey was the kickoff to the introduction of
the Jell-O Reading Rocket, a free reading program developed by the
Children's Television Workshop to cultivate an interest in reading
among children in grades 2 through 4, according to Mary Hiecke,
category manager of Jell_O Refrigerated Desserts.
   Among the specific survey findings:
   _91 percent of parents said reading well is very important to
their child's success, but only two-thirds of those with a child
old enough to read said they were very satisfied with the way that
child reads.
   _72 percent of parents believe how much a child reads is
critical to future success.
   _72 percent of the parents said it is primarily their
responsibility to make sure their children develop an interest in
reading, compared with 22 percent who said it is a mutual
responsibility of parent and school. Fifty-eight percent of parents
also said they are responsible for how well their children read.
   _51 percent of parents said their children are very interested
in reading outside of school, another third said their children are
somewhat interested while 13 percent said their children were not
very or not at all interested, a figure the survey said translates
into 5 million children.
   _44 percent of parents with children old enough to read said
their child reads for pleasure every day, and 43 percent said their
child reads for pleasure a few times a week.
   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.

   Iraq threatened on Tuesday to resume
long-range missile attacks, which could set off another round of
the ``war of the cities'' that has killed thousands of people.
   Iraq said it would resume missile barrages if Iran did not stop
shelling border towns.
   ``The Iranians ... bear full responsibility if they attack our
cities,'' declared Abdul Jabar Mohsen, chief Iraqi military
spokesman. ``Such attacks will not go unpunished.''
   Iran claimed Iraqi warplanes bombed a northwestern border
village near Sardasht, killing one civilian and wounding 10. On
Monday, the Iranians threatened retaliation if Iraq continued
attacks on towns.
   Vernon A. Walters, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was
touring the region and met with Sultan Qaboos of Oman, which shares
control of the Strait of Hormuz with Iran. The strait is the only
sea route to and from the Persian Gulf.
   Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi gunners shot
down an Iranian F-5 fighter-bomber Tuesday over Iraq's battered
southern port of Basra.
   In recent days Iran has been attacking Iraqi positions near
Basra, which has been the target of several Iranian thrusts across
the southern border since the war began in September 1980.
   The Iranians denied losing any of their dwindling supply of
U.S.-built F-5 jets and claimed their ground forces repulsed Iraqi
assaults in the central sector of the 730-mile border warfront.
   Action on the ground has increased recently, breaking a lull
that followed Iraq's recapture April 18 of its southern Faw
Peninsula, which Iran had held since February 1986.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, or IRNA, quoted
the commander for western Iran as saying more than 1,200 Iraqi
soldiers were killed or wounded in a battle Monday.
   It quoted the commander, whose name was not given, as saying the
Iranians repelled attacks by five Iraqi brigades on the border town
of Sumar, 80 miles northeast of Baghdad.
   Dispatches from IRNA claimed 89 civilians were killed and
hundreds wounded by Iraqi air raids and shelling since the last
round in the ``war of the cities'' ended April 21. It claimed 50
people were killed by a chemical attack May 20 on the northern town
of Paveh.
   IRNA also said 12 people were killed and 95 wounded when Iraqi
planes dropped chemical bombs last weekend on Ney, in the central
sector.
   Iraq says Iran has shelled Basra, the northern provincial
capital of Suleimaniyeh and other border towns 26 times since April
21. It has not given casualty figures.
   Thousands of civilians were killed in missile, air and artillery
attacks from Feb. 29 to April 21, the last major exchange in the
war on civilians that has been going on intermittently since 1984.
   Iran reported 1,700 civilians killed and 8,500 wounded but
diplomatic sources said the actual number of casualties probably
was double that. Iraq has not been exact, but reported hundreds of
civilian casualties.
   Walters visited Israel, Syria, Iraq and Kuwait before arriving
in Oman. He has reiterated U.S. determination to implement a U.N.
cease-fire resolution.
   He said American efforts include pushing for a follow-up
resolution that would impose an arms embargo on Iran if it does not
comply with the first measure.
   Iraq says it will abide by the resolution, which the Security
Council passed unanimously last July, if Iran does the same.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime says no truce is possible
until Iraq is designated the aggressor. Iraq invaded Iran in
September 1980 after several border skirmishes.

<TEXT>
   Republican leaders complained Tuesday that the
House is becoming more autocratic and legislation less substantive
as Democratic leaders increasingly bypass the normal legislative
process.
   ``If this were a republic in Central America, we'd be talking
about sending aid to restore democracy,'' said Rep. Lynn Martin,
R-Ill.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., and other GOP leaders
released new statistics showing that while the total number of
bills has remained about the same in the past decade, more and more
of them are commemorative or other non-substantive measures.
   In the current two-year Congress, the 100th, more than 47
percent of all the bills passed have been commemoratives. In the
95th Congress, it was just 9.5 percent.
   At the same time, more and more bills are brought before the
House with restrictive debate rules that limit amendments. And
about 40 percent of all House bills are not processed by House
committees, compared with virtually all a decade ago.
   ``We see a less thoughtful process, sloppier laws, declining
productivity and an emphasis on the frivolous as against the
substantive,'' Michel said.
   Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., the chairman of the House Republican
Conference, pointed his remarks at Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   ``It's a speaker who will not let the House proceed unless he
can dictate the outcome,'' Cheney said.
   Wright repeatedly has fought Republican efforts to stymie
Democratic initiatives by imposing the restrictive procedures. The
Democrats say the procedures are needed because Republicans are not
willing to allow the majority party to act its will.

<TEXT>
   A dairy farmer accused of killing seven
members of his family was sentenced to die for three of the murders
Tuesday.
   In ordering the sentence for James Schnick of Elkland, Judge
John Parrish followed the recommendation of a jury that last month
convicted Schnick of killing his wife Julie, 30, and nephews Kirk
Buckner, 14, and Michael Buckner, 2.
   Prosecutors had chosen not to try Schnick in four of the
killings.
   ``I thought the jury had sufficient evidence to render the
verdict and the sentence that they did,'' Parrish said after
Tuesday's hearing.
   Schnick, 37, who stood with his legs shackled, shook violently
as the judge imposed the death sentence. The only alternative would
have been life in prison without possibility of parole.
   Parrish asked Schnick if he believed he had been represented
adequately by Susan Chapman, a state public defender, and Webster
County Public Defender James McNabb.
   ``I don't know for sure,'' Schnick said, adding that he would
like to talk with other attorneys.
   Schnick was taken immediately to Jefferson City, where officials
at the state prison said 59 inmates already were on death row.
Missouri lawmakers approved reinstatement of the death penalty in
1977 but no one has been executed by the state since 1965.
   Before sentencing, Parrish overruled a motion by Schnick's
attorneys for a new trial. The state Supreme Court reviews all
death penalty cases and will consider issues raised in the motion,
which include an objection to jurors being shown what defense
attorneys called ``inflammatory'' photographs of the victims before
and after their deaths.
   The jury convicted Schnick April 14 after a week-long trial that
included a videotaped confession by the defendant. They recommended
the death penalty the next day.
   Schnick also was accused, but not tried, in the deaths of his
brother-in-law Steve Buckner, Buckner's wife Jeannette, and their
two other sons, Dennis, 8, and Timmy 6. Buckner and Mrs. Schnick
were brother and sister.
   All the victims were killed early Sept. 25 at the Schnick and
Buckner dairy farms. Schnick claimed that day that Kirk Buckner
killed his family before dying in a struggle with Schnick, and the
gun used in the shootings was found in Kirk's right hand. But
authorities' suspicions turned to Schnick after it was discovered
Kirk was left-handed.
   County prosecutor Donald Cheever alleged that Mrs. Schnick knew
her husband had a mistress and may have enlisted the support of her
brother and his family and asked Schnick for a divorce the evening
before they were killed.
   The defense said Schnick had told investigators that Steve
Buckner had molested Mrs. Schnick when the two were young and that
tension stemming from that may have led Kirk Buckner to commit the
murders.

<TEXT>
   A defendant in the Howard Beach racial assault
case pleaded guilty Tuesday to riot charges shortly before a judge
unsealed documents revealing another youth had admitted the same
crime at a secret hearing last week.
   Salvatore DeSimone, 20, entered his plea at an open session in a
Queens Criminal Court conference room before jury selection for the
remaining five defendants in the case resumed Tuesday morning.
   DeSimone, accompanied by his parents and attorney Augustus
Agate, also pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal facilitation for
driving members of a white gang to a confrontation with three
blacks on Dec. 20, 1986. The unsealed transcripts showed
co-defendant Harry Buonocore pleaded guilty to a riot charge last
week.
   Michael Griffith, 23, was killed in the 1986 incident after he
was struck by a car on the Belt Parkway.
   Buonocore's plea was entered at a secret proceeding before state
Supreme Court Justice Thomas Demakos, who then issued a gag order
regarding the session. On Monday, a four-judge panel of the state
Appellate Division ruled unanimously in favor of a motion by The
New York Times to unseal the transcript of the May 19 proceeding.
   The panel said Demakos is prohibited from excluding the press
and public from any future plea proceedings in the case.
   Buonocore, 19, and DeSimone will receive youthful offender
status insuring neither will be jailed, under the terms of their
pleas. Both face five years probation and 200 hours of community
service on their pleas; DeSimone will be sentenced June 27.
   It was unclear whether Buonocore will have to testify against
the remaining defendants, but DeSimone's plea insures he will not
have to, said Agate.
   ``If he is subpoenaed, we have not waived our Fifth Amendment
rights. ... He does not have to testify in this trial,'' Agate
said. Buonocore's attorney, Edward M. Rappaport, was in court
Tuesday and unavailable to comment on whether his client would
testify.
   The two plea bargains surprised defendant John Saggese, who
reasserted his innocence in the case.
   ``I'm not guilty of riot. I don't think Sal is guilty,'' said
Saggese. ``I couldn't have done it. I don't think anyone should
have plea-bargained at all.''
   Saggese, James Povinelli, Thomas Farino and William Bollander
are charged with riot in the case. A fifth defendant, Thomas
Gucciardo, is additionally charged with attempted murder and two
assault counts for attacking another black man that night.
   Jury selection is expected to take several weeks.

   The woman whose father killed a
federal judge in Pelham and then shot himself to death says she
wants the judge's family ``to know I ache for them.''
   ``It's just so hard,'' said Carolee Koster, 38, in her parents'
mobile home in Pennsylvania. ``There are so many things all jumbled
together.''
   Miss Koster and her mother, Mary, spoke with Gannett Westchester
Newspapers on Monday.
   Mrs. Koster, 66, who was married to Charles Koster for 45 years,
echoed her daughter's feelings.
   ``I'm sorry for that family, as I'm sorry for this family,'' she
said.
   As the Kosters sat inside with the windows closed as the
temperature neared 90 degrees, they spoke of being trapped by the
events that began with Saturday's shooting, by both the unwelcome
attention and the horror of what had happened.
   ``We have to get out of here,'' Carolee Koster said.
   Authorities said her father, a former New York City policeman
embittered by U.S. District Judge Richard Daronco's ruling against
Miss Koster's sexual harassment and job discrimination suit,
mortally wounded the judge in his Pelham garden and then shot
himself in the temple. The men were found dead a few feet apart.
   Lester D. Weiss, who lives in a mobile home next door to the
Kosters, remembered Charles Koster as a friendly man who minded his
own business.
   ``We're a little shocked. He used to come out every morning when
I was out and say, `Good morning,''' he told reporters. ``He must
have had it all inside.''
   Tom Miller, whose brother Scott owns the trailer park, was also
shocked. ``It was just a surprise to me. He seemed like a nice guy.
Everybody has their limits. Something must have snapped _ all the
pressure and everything. Something must have happened.''

<HEAD>Shamir Wants Early Elections; Arab Killed</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with Palestinian killed, other detail</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Tuesday that
elections should be held early to end divisions that cripple the
government during the Arab uprising.
   Soldiers shot another Palestinian dead in the Gaza Strip.
   Arab reports said soldiers shot and killed Saadi Sharhy, 52,
while searching his home in the Bureij refugee camp in the occupied
Gaza Strip. The army said he attacked a soldier, who opened fire.
   A nurse at the Ahli hospital in Gaza City said Sharhy was dead
on arrival with a gunshot wound in the chest. Speaking on condition
of anonymity, she quoted Sharhy's relatives as saying soldiers who
searched the home were accompanied by Israelis in civilian clothes.
   Army spokesmen said the trouble in Bureij occurred shortly
before 10 p.m., when a nightly five-hour curfew takes effect.
   At least 195 Arabs have been killed since violence began Dec. 8
among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which Israel has occupied since capturing them from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 war. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish settler also
have been killed.
   Army and hospital officials said soldiers shot and wounded a
28-year-old Arab on Tuesday during disturbances in Beit Fakir, near
the West Bank city of Nablus.
   Shamir, who leads the right-wing Likud bloc, said he wanted to
move up elections set for November to prevent ``public
nervousness'' over splits within the coalition government.
   His partner and rival in the tenuous coalition government,
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the center-left Labor Party,
opposes early elections.
   Shamir, visiting Yoqneam in northern Israel, told reporters:
``We have four months until the elections. If it were possible to
cut it short, it would be worthwhile to gain time and to prevent
public nervousness.''
   Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, said the premier wants early
elections because the government is paralyzed by policy differences
between Shamir and Peres.
   ``The government is neutralized, cannot advance toward anything,
it cannot take any major decisions because Shimon Peres has put the
whole world against us, unless we give in to the international
conference idea and give up the occupied territories,'' Ahimeir
said.
   Peres advocates an international peace conference to help solve
the Arab-Israeli conflict. Shamir says such a forum would put
pressure on Israel to make territorial concessions.
   Likud representatives said they had planned to submit a bill to
the Knesset on Wednesday proposing elections in August but dropped
the plan when it did not gain enough support from other parties, a
Shamir aide said.
   Recent public opinion polls indicate Likud would be most likely
to form Israel's next government.
   The latest poll published May 13 by the daily Yediot Ahronot had
the Likud and other right-wing parties winning 61 seats in the
120-member Parliament.
   Observers including political scientist Yitzhak Galnoor of the
Hebrew University and pollster Hanoch Smith have said the polls
reflect a hawkish public mood stirred by the Palestinian rebellion.
   A military court in Nablus began the trial Tuesday of a
Palestinian woman, Muneira Daoud, who is accused of stoning and
seriously injuring a Jewish settler.
   According to the court, Mrs. Daoud's action prompted the settler
to fire his gun and accidentally kill an Israeli teen-ager in the
West Bank village of Beita during unrest April 6, Israeli news
reports said. The teen-ager, Tirza Porat, was part of a student
hiking group.
   Israeli news reports said soldiers smashed chairs and desks in
some Arab schools in the West Bank while using the buildings as
bases during the rebellion. The schools reopened Monday after a
closure of nearly four months.
   Olivier Rafowicz, a military spokesman, said: ``There was
serious damage in some of the schools, but we are taking care of
everything and repairing it.''
   He said soldiers used only 30 of more than 1,194 West Bank
school buildings.

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Discussed At Abortion Federation Conference</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The number of abortions performed annually
since President Reagan's 1980 election has remained stable at
around 1.4 million, despite the administration's opposition, an
abortion rights advocate says.
   ``They've politicized the issue, but women still need abortions
and always will,'' Barbara Radford, executive director of the
National Abortion Federation, said in an interview Monday.
   The Washington, D.C.-based federation held its 12th annual
meeting in Minneapolis this week. The gathering attracted about 350
people who work in counseling centers, clinics and hospitals where
abortions are performed.
   Radford and others interviewed said that, even though polls show
a strong majority of Americans believe abortion should be legally
available, the issue is far from settled. One of the key elements
in the struggle, she said, is equal access to abortion for the
poor, young women and residents of rural areas.
   ``It's a common scenario,'' she said, speaking of the St.
Paul-Ramsey Medical Center where anti-abortion picketing was a
factor in the board voting in March to ban elective abortions. That
decision is on hold, however, pending review by the hospital's
parent board.
   Abortion rights advocates also are watching for a ruling from
the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals on Minnesota's 1981 law
requiring both parents of a minor girl to be notified before she
can obtain an abortion.
   The law, which also allows girls to seek a state judge's
approval instead of her parents', was found unconstitutional by
U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop five years after its passage and
is being reviewed by the full appeals panel.
   In other matters, convention delegates heard about a new oral
drug called RU 486 that acts to prevent a fertilized egg from
implanting in the uterus. The drug is expected to become
commercially available in France within a few weeks.
   It will be several years before American consumers will have
access to it, however, predicted Dr. Jane Hodgson of St. Paul,
because of more strict drug approval requirements by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration and product liability risks facing
pharmaceutical firms in the United States.
   The drug, which women would take if they missed a menstrual
period and had reason to fear a pregnancy, has complications for a
relatively small percentage of patients involving bleeding and
ectopic pregnancies, Hodgson said.

<HEAD>FEMA Official Removed From Seabrook Project Duties As Requested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal official who had refused to endorse
the evacuation plans for the Seabrook nuclear power plant was
granted his request Tuesday to be relieved of duties concerning the
controversial project.
   Edward Thomas, chief of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's natural and technological hazards division in Boston, said
his reputation and career had been jeopardized by verbal attacks
against him launched by both Seabrook proponents and staffers on
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   ``This is an issue of judgment that has been turned into an
issue of integrity,'' Thomas said in a telephone interview. ``The
facility administrators and the NRC can't accept that an honest man
can differ with their assessment, and I do.''
   There is an active campaign under way by the utility and some
NRC staff members to portray him as a liar, Thomas charged.
   Thomas entered the controversy surrounding the $5.4 billion
reactor in February, when his superiors overruled his objections to
the state of New Hampshire's proposed plan for an emergency
evacuation of Seabrook-area beaches.
   FEMA must approve a nuclear facility's evacuation plans before
the NRC will issue it an operating liscense.
   ``I'm not anti-nuke, but I think nuclear power needs regulation
and must be well-managed, because there is a potential for
catastrophe there,'' Thomas said. ``I'm not out to sink Seabrook.
I've reviewed and approved six nuclear power plants in New
England.''
   
   Thousands of people flock to beaches in the plant's vicinity
throughout the hot summer months, and Thomas said the evacuation
plan offered no way to help these people if there were an accident
at Seabrook.
   ``We end up with thousands of people who would be unable to be
protected,'' he said. ``People in sight of the plant would be with
no form of protection for hours.''
   A spokesman for FEMA in Washington, Russell Clanahan, said that
agency officials would be testifying about the reasons for FEMA's
reversal of Thomas' findings.
   Thomas said he and Henry Vickers, FEMA regional director, agree
that he cannot carry out his job and respond to his critics at the
same time. Vickers refused comment, but Thomas said he was relieved
of his responsibilities to the Seabrook project Tuesday.
   FEMA is still evaluating the number of personnel and amount of
resources that are provided for an emergency evacuation in the
state's plan. Before being granted his request to be relieved of
his Seabrook duties, Thomas was involved in that evaluation.
   He retains his duties related to emergency plans for the six
other nuclear power plants in New England.
   Thomas said he was disturbed by comments made by Seabrook's
attorney, Thomas Dignan. Thomas quoted the attorney as saying that
if FEMA didn't back down from its original reservations about New
Hampshire's plan, there would be ``blood all over the floor.''
   Thomas said it was a very personalized attack on him, and his
wife took it as a threat on her husband's life.
   Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said the utility and Dignan would
have no comment on the matter.
   Thomas said that he will defend himself against allegations that
he is biased against Seabrook when called to testify about his
opposition to the proposed safety plan.

<HEAD>U.S. Conservation Groups Urge Third World Debt Relief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of conservation organizations on
Tuesday opposed giving new U.S. money to the World Bank unless it
is tied to debt relief for the Third World.
   Sierra Club representative Larry Williams told a congressional
hearing he also was speaking for the National Wildlife Federation,
the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense
Fund and the Environmental Policy Institute.
   ``Without adequate environmental reform within the bank, an
increase on the scale now before this subcommittee suggests that
environmental disasters may be bankrolled at an ever increasing
rate,'' Williams said.
   He agreed with Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., who said that if
Congress propvides the money, it will be done in a way to promote
relief for the Third World from its $1.2 trillion in debt.
   It was the third and last of a series of hearings before the
House Banking subcommittee on international development
institutions.
   The World Bank is the largest source of aid to the Third World,
lending about $17 billion a year. It is owned by 151 governments.
   It plans to increase its capital so it can lend more than $20
billion a year in the 1990s. Enough countries are contributing to
put through the increase. The United States, until now the biggest
supporter of the bank, has been holding back.
   The Reagan administration has pledged the first $70 million
needed but its proposal has not been supported in Congress.
   There is sentiment in Congress to make the money conditional on
action for debt relief. Others have attacked the bank for making
loans to communist governments and for promoting Third World
industries that compete with industry in the United States.

<HEAD>Defendants Contend Their Congressional Testimony Can't Be Used In
Court</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Oliver L. North and two
co-defendants in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case Tuesday disputed a
prosecution claim that hundreds of statements they made to Congress
were not covered by immunity grants.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh was ``completely wrong on
the law'' by claiming that fired National Security Council aide
North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms
dealer Albert Hakim made numerous statements during last year's
Iran-Contra hearings that could be used as evidence against them,
the defense said in a brief filed in U.S. District Court.
   Walsh ``seeks to punish defendants for responding fully and in
good faith to congressional inquiries, when compelled to do so over
vehement objection, and for relaying to Congress and the nation
what occurred and why,'' the defense said.
   North, Poindexter and Hakim testified under limited grants of
immunity from prosecution. But Walsh contends that hundreds of
statements they made were not covered by so-called ``use'' immunity
because they were not in response to questions posed by the
Iran-Contra committees.
   Walsh offered not to use any of the congressional testimony
during the trial if the court decides other immunity issues in his
favor.
   The defense accused Walsh of trying ``to threaten the court with
a lengthy inquiry into immunized testimony, and then to use that
threat as leverage to strike a favorable bargain with the court.''
   ``This tactic is unseemly,'' the defense lawyers said in a joint
pleading.
   North, Poindexter and Hakim are accused along with retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord of conspiring to defraud the
government by diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Secord testified without an immunity grant from Congress and
therefore is not part of his co-defendants' attempt to overturn the
indictment on the ground that Walsh's investigation was tainted by
illegal use of immunized testimony.
   In its latest filing, the defense said, ``There is no claim that
defendants uttered a single word, during the course of their
congressional testimony, that was outside the subject matter of the
congressional inquiry.''
   North, Poindexter and Hakim did not waive their Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination when they ``explained their
answers; or sought to provide useful, related information to be
sure their answers were complete and accurate _ in short, the
`whole truth' they had sworn to provide.''
   The defense urged U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to
reject Walsh's argument, which would require the court to perform
the difficult task of determining if each of the hundreds of
statements was protected by the immunity grant.
   These statements, the prosecution contends, includes
Poindexter's testimony that he approved the diversion of funds but
did not tell President Reagan so that he could give the president
deniability if the operation were later exposed.
   They also include Poindexter's statements that during Attorney
General Edwin Meese III's November 1986 investigation, Poindexter
destroyed a presidential intelligence finding authorizing CIA
involvement in one 1985 arms shipment to Iran.
   Walsh also claims that North's statements the he destroyed
documents in October and November 1986 could be used as evidence to
prove charges that North obstructed Meese's inquiry.
   In a separate filing Tuesday, Walsh's office said, ``It is clear
beyond doubt'' that North, Poindexter and Hakim waged a ``public
relations battle'' during their congressional testimony.
   ``In utter defiance of the questions put to them, they sought to
win with speeches and arguments,'' the prosecution brief said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Army helicopters scoured the
Caribbean for a Nicaraguan cargo plane with a crew of six that
failed to arrive on schedule Tuesday at Costa Rica's port city of
Limon.
   The incident came one day after a jetliner ran off the runway
and smashed through a fence while trying to take off at the San
Jose airport on a flight to Miami. All 22 passengers and crew fled
the Boeing 727-100 minutes before it burst into flames.
   Ten people were treated for minor injuries. The plane, of the
Costa Rican airline Lacsa, carried eight crew members and 14
passengers, including seven Americans.
   The cargo plane, belonging to the Nicaraguan government airline
Aeronica, was due at Limon at 6:48 a.m. (8:48 a.m. EDT) Tuesday.
   Aeronica headquarters in Managua said the flight was operating
with six crew members and was carrying 23,000 pounds of cargo. The
nature of the cargo was not disclosed.
   ``We can't say that it crashed, only that it is missing,''
Walter Gutierrez, the airline's deputy manager, said in an
interview. ``The reports we have are that the weather has worsened.
We don't know the cause of the disappearance of the aircraft.''
   Jose Antonio Guzman, the air controller at Juan Santamaria
Airport in San Jose, said the cargo plane started its trip in
Panama City and was to have gone on to Managua, Nicaragua, after
stopping at Limon.
   An official reached by telephone at the airport in Limon said
the missing plane was a four-engine DC-6.
   The official, who identified himself only as Brenes, said two
U.S. Army UH-1 helicopters based in Limon as part of an engineering
unit there since February were helping search for the plane. He
said two small planes and the Costa Rican coast guard also were
looking for it.
   The international airport at San Jose was operating normally
Tuesday, Guzman said.
   Lacsa Flight 628 had been scheduled to stop in Managua before
continuing to Miami on Monday.
   Officials said the jet left the terminal at 4:55 p.m., headed
down the runway and crashed through a fence surrounding the airport
after failing to take off. The plane came to a stop about 600 yards
beyond the fence on a grassy area, where it burst into flames. The
aircraft broke into three sections.
   ``Miraculously, there were no deaths,'' said Juan Manuel
Fernandez, financial vice president of Lacsa.
   ``Thanks to the skill of the pilots, they were able to evacuate
the passengers, just a few minutes before the plane burst into
flames.''
   Co-pilot Armando Rojas told reporters the passengers remained
calm.
   ``With nerves of steel we were able to evacuate all the
passengers,'' Rojas said. ``A few minutes later, maybe five
minutes, the plane burst into flames.''
   Fernandez told reporters the cause of the explosion was under
investigation by officials of Lacsa, Boeing and the Costa Rican
civil aviation agency.

   Rebels in northern Ethiopia claimed
Tuesday they had repulsed an army offensive timed to coincide with
the current African summit in Addis Ababa, killing or wounding more
than 9,000 soldiers in 11 days.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front said the battle occurred
May 13-23 when the army tried to recapture Afabet, a town 70 miles
north of the provincial capital Asmara that fell to a rebel assault
in March. The claims were made on the clandestine Voice of the
Broad Masses of Eritrea radio.
   Ethiopia is the host for the Organization of African Unity
summit May 19-28, which also marks the organization's 25th
anniversary.
   According to the Eritrean rebels, President Mengistu Haile
Mariam's government ordered an army offensive in an attempt ``to
appear victorious during the OAU's jubilee celebrations.''
   They said their fighters thwarted a three-pronged drive from
government strongholds in Eritrea's eastern plains. The rebels
claimed 5,300 soldiers were killed, 3,800 wounded and 300 taken
prisoner, and said the 102nd Airborne Division was destroyed.
   Government forces also lost 33 tanks and 28 other vehicles and
rebels captured thousands of rifles, the radio said.
   Independent verification of claims in the northern civil war is
impossible because the Marxist government forbids travel to the
provinces of Eritrea and Tigre, both of which have active
separatist guerrilla movements.
   Ethiopia said Saturday the army had begun an offensive in both
provinces. It had been expected since rebel victories in March in
both provinces.
   Eritrean rebels have fought for 27 years. Those in Tigre went to
war in 1974.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has dropped a challenge
to an order from the Environmental Protection Agency and will
recall 82,600 Pontiacs and Buicks from the 1981 model year to fix
pollution control systems, EPA said Tuesday.
   The cars in question are equipped with a 4.3-liter, six-cylinder
engine and were sold as the Pontiac LeMans, Lemans Wagon, Grand
Prix, Catalina, Bonneville and Firebird, and as the Buick Regal,
Century and Century Wagon.
   EPA ordered GM to recall the cars in August 1985 because their
gasoline evaporative control systems permitted 6.6 grams of vapor
to escape during a test for which the maximum vapor emission is
supposed to be 2.0 grams.
   GM requested a hearing on the order. A company statement said,
``We believe the cars comply'' but GM is dropping the challenge
``to prevent unnecessary litigation.''
   Dealers will install a valve in the control system that will
increase the capacity of the charcoal vapor capture cannister.
   EPA said owners should wait for a letter from GM before calling
dealers. The letter will be mailed in September, and GM said it
will take that long to make the necessary parts available.

<HEAD>First Speech By Black In Parliament Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time, a black
spoke Tuesday in an official proceeding at South Africa's
Parliament building, state radio reported.
   Blacks make up 75 percent of South Africa's 35 million people
but have no representation in Parliament and no vote in national
affairs.
   The precedent-setting speech came during committee debate in
Cape Town on the proposed budget for Cape Province. Similar debates
took place Monday and Tuesday in capitals of the other three
provinces.
   Cape Town is this country's legislative capital. Pretoria is the
administrative capital and Bloemfontein the judicial capital.
   The session in Cape Town was addressed by Temba Nyati, a black
appointed last year to the provincial executive committee.
   Nyati spoke about the importance of municipal government. He
later told the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. blacks
should view participation in local government as a first step
toward sharing power at higher levels.
   The parliamentary committee meeting in Pretoria to debate the
Transvaal Province budget also was addressed by a black, John
Mavuso, who serves on the Transvaal executive committee.
   ``I believe we have really arrived in South Africa,'' Mavuso
said. ``I thank the almighty God for making this possible.''
   The debates mark the first time that members of the white, Asian
and mixed-race chambers of Parliament have participated in joint
work sessions.
   Members of the far-right Conservative Party walked out of the
debates Monday to protest being ``co-governed'' by other racial
groups. Lawmakers to the left of the National Party government
described the sessions as a farce, in part because no joint voting
will be conducted.
   On Tuesday, members of the majority Labor Party in the
mixed-race chamber walked out of the debate in Cape Town to protest
a government official's defense of segregated beaches.
   A new constitution in 1984 created the Asian and mixed-race
chambers of Parliament but still excluded the black majority from
national affairs.
   The white chamber is able to get its say on all major
legislative issues.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in South Africa in which the 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health
services.

<TEXT>
   Iran lost an estimated 50,000
barrels of oil a day from four offshore platforms destroyed by the
U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh said Tuesday.
   But he said that Iran compensated by boosting production in
other oilfields.
   Aqazadeh spoke at a news conference as he wound up visits to Abu
Dhabi and Dubai, the two leading oil producers in the United Arab
Emirates.
   He said that Iraq, Iran's enemy in the gulf war that began in
September 1980, had failed to halt the flow of Iranian oil.
   ``Our production is within the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries quota and we are exporting,'' he said.
   The respected Middle East Economic Survey, published in Cyprus,
said Monday that Iran is producing an estimated 2.2 million to 2.3
million barrels of oil a day.
   Aqazadeh has been campaigning for production cuts by oil
producers inside and outside OPEC to shore up sagging oil prices
around the cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   Aqazadeh has visited Oman and is scheduled to visit Indonesia
prior to OPEC's biannual ministerial session in Vienna June 8.
   He conceded that Iran's oil industry has faced ``some
problems.'' But he said these had been sorted out and referred to
plans to build pipelines to terminals outside the gulf, where
Iran's tankers have been under constant attack from Iraqi warplanes.
   He also noted talks with the Soviet Union to reactivate an
unused gas pipeline to the Black Sea, saying it would be converted
to carry oil.
   Aqazadeh repeated Iranian charges that the United States helped
Iraq carry out a devastating air raid on Iran's Larak Island oil
terminal in the mouth of the Strait of Hormuz May 18. Five tankers
were set on fire.
   He said Iraq could not have carried out the raid without radar
assistance and U.S. jamming of Iranian radar and radio systems. U.S
officials deny that.
   Among those with whom Aqazadeh held talks were the rulers of
Dubai and neighboring Sharjah, which with Abu Dhabi and four other
emirates form the United Arab Emirates.
   Iranian gunboats attacked Sharjah's Mubarak oilfield during
clashes with the U.S. Navy April 18 after the Americans had shelled
Iran's Sassan and Sirri-D oil platforms.
   U.S. warships destroyed two other Iranian platforms last year in
retaliation for Iranian mining of shipping channels and other
hostile actions.
   Aqazadeh also said he expected France and Iran will develop
``greater economic cooperation'' following an improvement in
relations since pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon released three
French hostages May 4.

<TEXT>
   A chanting crowd of 200 Cuban-Americans gathered
outside the federal courthouse Tuesday demanding freedom for
convicted terrorist Orlando Bosch, but a federal judge declined to
issue an immediate ruling in the case.
   After a 1{-hour hearing, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler
gave no indication on when he would decide whether Bosch can be
released on bond pending Immigration and Naturalization Service
efforts to expel him.
   To bolster their argument that Bosch schould not be released,
government officials presented the judge with more than 700 pages
of classified documents to review.
   Bosch, brought in leg irons and manacles to a courtroom packed
with his supporters, had come to the United States in February
after spending 11 years in Venezuelan prisons on a charge of
blowing up a Cuban airliner in 1976, killing all 73 aboard. He was
eventually cleared of that accusation.
   He had fled the United States in 1974 while serving out
probation for a 1968 bazooka attack on a Polish ship that had
traded with Cuba.
   The INS calls him a dangerous terrorist and has ordered him
expelled.
   Outside the courthouse, Cuban-Americans carrying signs saying
``Deportation is a death sentence'' and ``Bosch is a hero'' chanted
in Spanish, demanding freedom for the 61-year-old former
pediatrician.
   A Miami police SWAT team looked down on the crowd from the
courthouse roof, and about 50 officers stood around the crowd to
prevent incidents.
   ``He's not a terrorist,'' said Bosch's daughter Myriam Bosch.
``The Polish ship incident, he was trained to do by the CIA.
Anybody who calls him a terrorist doesn't know anything about the
man.''
   The demonstration shows that the Cuban and Latin communities are
behind Bosch, said his son William.
   ``We're only here to ask freedom for my father,'' he said.
   The Boschs said their father was recovering from surgery for
prostate cancer and was extremely ill.
   Ms. Bosch accused the United States of expelling Bosch for the
same reasons Venezuela had kept him in prison for 11 years _ to
better its relations with Cuba.
   Despite protestations by his family and supporters, the INS has
accused Bosch of close associations with militant anti-Castro
terrorist groups.
   Bosch was a leader in two violent organizations that advocated
the assassination of government officials, the INS said in its
report ordering his expulsion.
   One of the groups, the Coordination of United Revolutionary
Organizations, ``has been responsible for more than 50 bombings in
Miami, New York, Venezuela, Panama, Mexico and Argentina,'' said
the INS.
   The INS has indicated that if expelled, Bosch would not be
returned to Cuba, but has not said where he would be sent.

<HEAD>Runcie Against Women Bishops `At The Moment'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual
leader of the world's Anglicans, said Tuesday he may approve women
bishops someday, but not yet.
   ``At the moment, I am not in favor of a woman bishop's
consecration,'' the prelate told a news conference. ``I am waiting
for the right time for that to emerge.'' He would not speculate
when that might be.
   Runcie is spiritual head of the state Church of England and
leader of the 70 million Anglicans worldwide, including 3 million
Episcopalians in the United States.
   U.S. Episcopalians, one of 27 self-governing Anglican provinces,
have been discussing consecration of a woman bishop and may proceed
with it before the decade ends.
   The issue is controversial because all Anglicans look to Runcie
for leadership, although there is no central authority in the
worldwide community.
   Anglicans are held together by being in communion with the
archbishop of Canterbury. If an Anglican woman became a bishop he
would have to accept or reject her.
   King Henry VIII established the Church of England when he
ordered the abolition of papal authority in 1534 after Pope Clement
VII refused him a divorce from his first queen, Catherine of Aragon.
   Lack of a central Anglican authority became a problem only in
the 1970s after the U.S. Episcopalians ordained many women as
priests.
   The London-based Movement for the Ordination of Women said
Tuesday more than 1,000 women have become Anglican priests, most in
the United States and the others in Hong Kong, canada, New Zealand,
Brazil, Uganda and Kenya.
   The Church of England is one of the majority of provinces still
refusing the priesthood to women. Some bishops and clergy say they
might eventually accept women as priests but not as bishops.
   Bishops are deemed to derive their authority the 12 disciples of
Jesus, all of whom were men.
   Women as bishops will be a central issue at this year's Lambeth
Conference, a three-week meeting of Anglican bishops that is held
every 10 years and begins July 16 in Canterbury. Some Anglican
provinces opposed to women priests may threaten to quit the
Anglican Communion if a woman bishop is ordained.
   The Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches, which have all-male
priesthoods, have said the ordination of women makes it difficult
for them to see how there can be eventual unity with Anglicans.
   Runcie spoke to reporters at his official Lambeth Palace
residence to introduce a collection of speeches he made in New York
and San Francisco in January on the question of authority in
society and the church. He called the 52-page booklet ``Authority
in Crisis?''
   In it, he says: ``No one will question that it has been the
contentious issue of the ordination of women to the priesthood _
and now episcopate _ which has demonstrated an inadequacy in the
central structures of the Anglican Communion.''

   The remains of two Marines
whose helicopter was downed during last month's fighting with Iran
in the Persian Gulf were returned here Tuesday in a brief, solemn
ceremony.
   The remains of Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, 33, of Thomasville, N.C.,
and Capt. Stephen C. Leslie, 30, of New Bern, N.C., arrived on a
C-5A Galaxy from Rhein-Main Air Base in West Germany.
   While a 24-man honor guard stood at attention, the Marine Band
played ``Muffled Ruffles,'' ``Eternal Father'' and a slow rendition
of the ``Marine Hymn,'' while pallbearers carried the flag-draped
coffins to waiting hearses.
   Leslie's parents, Dr. Robert E. and Ruth T. Leslie, looked on,
as Brig. Gen. Richard L. Phillips stood by and extended his
condolences.
   Navy Chaplain Capt. Walter A. Hiskett prayed that their ``heroic
actions inspire us to uphold the traditions they bought with their
lives.''
   The remains are scheduled to leave Dover Wednesday morning for
burial at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington.
   Hill and Leslie were flying a Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra helicopter
when it went down in the Persian Gulf on April 18, hit by gunfire
or a missile.
   The helicopter vanished on a night reconnaissance mission, a few
hours after U.S. and Iranian naval forces had fought a series of
day-long clashes in the southern Gulf.
   Dover has the largest military mortuary on the East Coast, and
prepares for burial the remains of military personnel killed
overseas.

<HEAD>Linguistics Expert Says Hastings and Lawyer Spoke in Code</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A linguistics expert told a House impeachment
panel Tuesday that a telephone conversation between federal judge
Alcee L. Hastings and a Washington lawyer in October 1981 was
spoken in code, possibly in an attempt to disguise details of a
bribery conspiracy.
   The secretly tape-recorded phone call from Hastings to his
lawyer friend, William A. Borders, is regarded as crucial to
charges that Hastings, a U.S. district court judge in Miami, sought
to conceal his role in the alleged bribery scheme by lying under
oath and fabricating evidence at his trial five years ago.
   Although Hastings was acquitted of conspiring to solicit a
$150,000 bribe from two convicted racketeers, the House Judiciary
subcommittee on criminal justice is reviewing an investigative
report by a special panel of appeals court judges which found
``clear and convincing evidence'' that Hastings committed the crime
and tried to cover it up.
   Resuming its televised impeachment hearings Tuesday, the
subcommittee heard Roger W. Shuy, a linguistics professor at
Georgetown University, testify about his study of an FBI tape of
the Oct. 5, 1981, conversation between Hastings and Borders.
   Hastings says the 29-second conversation concerned some letters
he had drafted in support of efforts by another friend, Hemphill
Pride of Columbia, S.C., regain his lawyer's credentials after he
completed a three-year prison term for misappropriation of housing
funds.
   Shuy said the recording ``indicates that Borders and Hastings
were using a code to convey information that was not obvious to
outsiders.''
   He said his analysis, which employed several linguistic
techniques and sophisticated electronic listening devices, led him
to conclude that ``a not very well-practiced code was being used,''
involving not only their words but ``the structure of the
dialogue.''
   Shuy refused to speculate what Hastings and Borders were really
discussing. But under questioning by House staff lawyers, Shuy
conceded it was possible they were talking about details of payment
of the alleged bribe and whether Hastings should issue a reciprocal
court order returning a major portion of forfeited assets seized
from the racketeers.
   The panel is studying whether to recommend that the full House
impeach Hastings on the charges filed by a panel of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals. If the House votes to impeach and the
Senate convicts him in a subsequent trial, Hastings would be
removed from the federal bench.
   The subcommittee has subpoenaed Borders to appear when it
resumes its televised hearings Wednesday, but he was expected to
refuse to testify.
   Borders was convicted at a separate trial in 1982 of arranging
the bribe allegedly intended for Hastings, but he has consistently
refused to testify about his close friend.
   House investigators are eager to ask Borders whether Hastings
was aware that his friend was arranging a bribe for him. Hastings
insists that he knew nothing of the bribery scheme and accuses
Borders of trading on his name to shake down the two racketeers,
Frank and Tom Romano.
   Roberto Martinez, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Miami,
testified Tuesday that two major undercover investigations were
abandoned in September 1985 after they were divulged by a leak of
information attributed to Hastings.
   Martinez said Hastings learned of the investigations of union
corruption on the Miami waterfront and corrupt zoning practices by
city officials in Hialeah, Fla., when Martinez gave Hastings
routine progress reports on court-approved use of wiretaps in both
cases.
   Hastings allegedly mentioned the investigations to Dade County
Mayor Steve Clark, who later told federal law enforcement officials
that Hastings was the source of the leak, Martinez said.
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, said the Justice Department decided
not to prosecute because it did not believe it could win a
conviction.
   Martinez said under questioning that although he had
``tremendous confidence in Judge Hastings'' before the incident, he
now believed it would be ``dangerous'' for Hastings to have access
to sensitive information about federal criminal investigations.

   The Senate's Democratic and Republican leaders
agreed Tuesday the chamber still has time to approve the
medium-range missile treaty before President Reagan's summit
meeting next week as long as the Senate votes to halt debate by
conservative Republicans.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., filed a petition
Tuesday to halt debate. That measure, known as a cloture vote,
cannot come up for a vote before Thursday.
   ``It's conceivable that we could finish the work on the treaty
by Friday or Saturday,'' Byrd told reporters after a White House
meeting with Reagan to discuss the May 29-June 2 summit between the
president and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., agreed with Byrd that
time remains before the summit to ratify the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty. ``We can make it if we start staying in late
and we file cloture today,'' he told reporters.
   A successful cloture motion, which would limit debate, requires
60 votes. Far more than 60 senators have supported the treaty in a
series of early-round test votes. Approval of a cloture motion
Thursday would begin a 30-hour clock for debate, meaning a vote on
the treaty could occur Friday.
   Byrd said he wants the Senate to act before Reagan meets
Gorbachev. ``I think the president's hand would be strengthened
there and I think it would be in the interests of our own country
to have the president with the instruments of ratification.''
   GOP conservatives opposed to the pact have used Senate rules,
which are designed to protect the minority, to delay a vote on the
pact signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Gorbachev.
   Reagan, setting the stage for the summit, said Tuesday he hoped
to conclude a treaty to cut long-range nuclear arsenals before his
term expires in eight months. But acknowledged that might not be
possible.
   ``It is the requirements of a good treaty and not some arbitrary
deadline that will determine the timetable,'' Reagan said in an
address beamed across Europe on the U.S. Information Agency's
``Worldnet'' satellite service. The speech was taped Monday in the
Oval Office.
   The INF treaty requires the elimination within three years of
all U.S. and Soviet missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400
miles.
   When the Senate finally votes on the pact, ratification is
assured, Dole noted, because only 67 votes are required. ``The
question is how many votes are going to be for it,'' he said. ``Is
it going to be 94, 95, 92? It's not even close.''
   In a Senate speech, Dole appealed to his fellow party members to
support Reagan. ``I hope, as the Republican leader speaking for my
Republican president who's in the last year of his second term,
that we might be able to accommodate him in this instance.''
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the chief opponent, refused to
mute his criticism.
   Helms noted his long support of Reagan, but said, ``I think he's
wrong on this treaty, I think he's been misled, I think he's been
misguided and my conscience will not allow me not to pursue the
obvious defects of this treaty.''
   Helms noted that nine GOP-backed amendments have been defeated
overwhelmingly.
   ``All amendments have been rejected because the State Department
came to the Foreign Relations Committee and said there must be no
amendments to this treaty because the Soviets won't like it. ... I
happen to be one of those senators who don't care whether the
Soviets like it or not.''
   Referring to Gorbachev, Helms said, ``I don't care whether we
offend him or not. Let's get it right the first time before the
Senate attaches its approval to the ratification of the treaty.''
   Later Tuesday, Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., said he
supported the move to halt debate. ``Why should a small majority
deprive the vast majority of this and the people of this country,
its will _ ratification before the summit?''
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., agreed, telling his colleagues,
``We're going to approve this treaty. It's only a question of how
many votes. ... I think it'll get 90 votes.''
   He accused opponents of ``nuclear idolatry'' and said ``the
ideologues will never, never go gently into the night.''

   Cuba's vice president, Carlos Rafael
Rodriguez, said Tuesday that the era of ``Reaganism'' clearly is
over in the United States, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina
reported.
   The dispatch from Havana, monitored in Mexico City, said
Rodriguez told local reporters that President Reagan's
``aggressiveness and his threats of using violence against Cuba,
Nicaragua, Panama, have no future in current conditions.''
   He said such policies are even less relevant ``when a certain
global agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union is
being glimpsed on humanity's most crucial problems,'' the dispatch
said.
   Prensa Latina quoted Rodriguez as also saying that many believe
that relations between communist Cuba and the United States can be
re-established only when there is a conservative administration in
Washington.
   ``Bush is that type of leader, but nothing indicates that he is
disposed to take such a decisive step,'' the Cuban vice president
was quoted as saying of Vice President George Bush, who now is
considered certain to be the Republican Party's presidential
nominee.
   Rodriguez said the front-running Democratic candidate for
president, Michael Dukakis, has announced a Latin American policy
that would be radically different from Reagan's and more similar to
development plans proposed by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and
John F. Kennedy.
   ``The conditions are different, and for our part we are prepared
for dialogue, on the base of mutual respect, the elimination of the
(U.S.) blockade and the liquidation of the irritating thorn that we
have in our presence of the military base of Guantanamo on Cuban
territory,'' the Cuban official was quoted as saying.

   President Reagan combined praise with
criticism for the Kremlin on Tuesday in advance of the superpower
summit, while the White House prodded the Senate to ratify a
U.S.-Soviet arms treaty before the president arrives in Moscow this
weekend.
   Senate leaders, trying to spare Reagan the embarrassment of
meeting Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev without a ratified
treaty, announced plans to cut off debate on the accord, which bans
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which Reagan and
Gorbachev signed Dec. 8, seems assured of approval by an
overwhelming majority, but has been stalled by a handful of
opponents.
   After a speech Wednesday morning on the South Grounds of the
White House, Reagan will fly to Helsinki, Finland, arriving in the
pre-dawn hours Thursday.
   He will remain there until Sunday morning, when he boards Air
Force One to travel to Moscow. It will be the first visit to the
Soviet Union for the 77-year-old Reagan and will mark the first
time in 14 years that an American president has visited Moscow.
   Almost immediately after his arrival, Reagan and Gorbachev will
begin talks, their fourth summit in 30 months.
   In a speech broadcast to Europe on Tuesday, Reagan said U.S.
relations with Moscow must be guided by realism.
   ``We do not expect a quick, radical transformation of the Soviet
system,'' he said. ``We do not expect to turn a corner one day to
find that all our problems have gone away because our adversary has
been transformed. There still remain profound political and moral
differences between the Soviet system and our own.''
   He hailed the Soviets for progress on human rights, specifically
in terms of the release of political and religious prisoners, an
increase in emigration, resolution of cases of divided families and
separated spouses, and an easing of censorship.
   ``Yet, despite this progress, the human rights situation in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is far from good,'' Reagan added.
He cited a string of problems, including restraints on religion,
peaceful demonstrations, freedom of movement and unofficial
publications.
   The president's remarks were broadcast overseas on the U.S.
Information Agency's ``Worldnet'' satellite service. The speech was
taped Monday in the Oval Office.
   The arms treaty, which crowned Reagan's summit with Gorbachev in
Washington last December, was endorsed Monday by the Supreme
Soviet, the nominal parliament.
   Toning down summit expectations, Assistant Secretary of State
Rozanne Ridgway told reporters Tuesday, ``Don't look at this summit
in terms of its potential for drama or breakthroughs but rather its
essence is that of continuity.''
   However, she said the summit outcome ``isn't pre-cooked and
never has been with these two leaders.''
   Gorbachev said in an interview published this week in The
Washington Post and Newsweek magazine that he would propose
U.S.-Soviet cooperation on an unmanned flight to Mars. However,
Ridgway said sucha project would involve technology transfer issues
``that need very careful examination.''
   She said that although the Soviets may propose it officially,
``I would not expect the United States side to be in a position to
respond at this time.''
   In addition to three minor arms agreements, she said there would
be documents to sign on cultural programs, fishing, civilian
nuclear reactor safety, transportation technologies and a packet of
understandings on Coast Guard-maritime issues.
   Amid other summit preparations Tuesday, Reagan gave an interview
to five European journalists. He also conferred with his Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board on arms control strategy and briefed
his Cabinet on the summit agenda.
   Reagan also met at the White House with Democratic and
Republican leaders of Congress, and got assurances the Senate
probably would ratify the INF pact in time for him to exchange
ratification documents with Gorbachev in Moscow.
   ``While we should never place artificial deadlines on matters of
policy and national security, the time has come for prompt
action,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   He said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told Reagan
that ``in all likelihood, the Senate will be able to act on the
treaty by Friday.''
   Howard Baker, the White House chief of staff, will stay behind
in Washington when Reagan leaves to follow the Senate debate on the
treaty, which calls for the elimination over three years of nuclear
missiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3,400 miles.
   ``I asked the president's consent to stay here while the treaty
is still before the Senate,'' Baker said Tuesday in an interview on
the CBS Evening News.
   ``I hope to take ratification documents to the president in
Moscow.''
   The spokesman said Baker will travel to Moscow on Saturday and
be on hand when Reagan lands the next day.
   Reagan, in his speech, was silent on the race for ratification
of the treaty. He said, however, he hoped that before he leaves
office he can conclude an even more ambitious agreement with
Gorbachev to reduce strategic nuclear weapons.
   However, he said, ``it is the requirements of a good treaty and
not some arbitrary deadline that will determine the timetable.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan was looking forward to the journey,
particularly his meetings with Soviet writers, artists, filmmakers,
dissidents, refuseniks and others.
   ``He thinks he has an important message about freedom and
democracy for them and he thinks it's also helpful to encourage
them as they seek more freedoms under the glasnost policies,''
Fitzwater said.

   Thunderstorms swept across the Southeast Tuesday, spreading
rain, heavy winds and hail from the Gulf Coast to the Carolinas.
   A cold front also generated thunderstorms from New England to
the Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
   Rain hit southern Texas, south-central Colorado and northwest
Montana, while sunny or partly sunny skies prevailed over much of
the West, the northern and central Plains and the Great Lakes.
   Colder air on the edge of a low pressure system over western
Kentucky replaced warmer, more humid air over the Southeast and
generated showers and thunderstorms from Alabama to the Carolinas.
Showers and thunderstorms also were numerous from the central Gulf
Coast to Florida.
   St. Tammany Parish in extreme southeast Louisiana reported
2-inch hailstones. Golfball-sized hail pelted Claiborne, Ala.,
while Monroe County in northern Alabama was shelled with 1{-inch
hail.
   Nickel- and dime-sized hail peppered several parts of North
Carolina and strong storm winds destroyed a barn near Shelby. There
also was an unconfirmed report that a tornado touched down in Union
County, on the state's south-central border.
   A woman died of injuries received Monday when lightning knocked
a tree limb onto a truck she was driving in Gaston County, also on
North Carolina's south-central border.
   In the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT, Montgomery, Ala.,
received over three-quarters of an inch of rain, while just under
three-quarters of an inch was recorded at Cape Hatteras, N.C., and
at Rickenbacker Air Force Base, south of Columbus, Ohio.
   Further north, thunderstorms dropped dime-sized hail on
Springfield and Spencer, Mass., and gusts to 55 mph were reported
at Winthrop, Mass.
   Skies were mostly sunny across the northern and central Plains
and the upper Great Lakes with temperatures mostly in the 60s or
70s, except for some 40s and 50s in the northern parts of the Lakes
region.
   Some clouds developed this afternoon over southern Texas with
showers and thunderstorms developing over the lower Rio Grande
Valley. Conditions were warm and humid with readings in the low 90s.
   Partly cloudy skies were the rule from the Pacific Coast to
Nevada and other parts of the Southwest, with temperatures ranging
from the 50s and 60s in the Pacific Northwest to the mid to upper
90s in the deserts.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 46 degrees at Marquette
and Sault Ste. Marie, Minn., to 98 degrees at Needles, Calif., and
Gila Bend, Ariz.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast Wednesday for
northern New England, along the Atlantic Coast, and through much of
the Carolinas into the eastern Gulf Coast and across Florida, with
the heaviest concentration along the South Carolina coast and from
central Florida to southern Georgia. Rain was forecast for the
coasts of Washington and northwest Oregon. The rest of the nation
was expected to be dry with mostly sunny skies.
   Highs were predicted in the 60s along the northern and central
Pacific Coast, and from the Great Lakes and much of the Ohio Valley
to the Atlantic Coast, with highs only in the 50s in central
Pennsylvania, much of New York and Maine. Highs were forecast to be
in the 90s from the valleys of central California to the Rio Grande
Valley in Texas, with temperatures up to 105 degrees in the
Southwest deserts.
   The rest of the nation was expected to have highs in the 70s and
80s.

   Andrew Jenkins on Tuesday became the new
school superintendent for the school system in the nation's capital.
   Jenkins, a 27-year veteran of the District of Columbia school
system, who had been acting superintendent, was appointed to the
post permanently after a three-month search.
   ``I look forward to working with the board of education,''
Jenkins said, ``but most of all, I look forward to working for the
boys and girls and young men and young women of the school
district.''
   Jenkins, 50, had since 1981 been deputy superintendent to
Floretta D. McKenzie who left in February to start an education
consulting firm. The board had passed over Jenkins to hire McKenzie
from outside.
   ``I think Mr. Jenkins has made a very good contribution to
education in the District of Columbia,'' said city councilmember
Hilda Mason, who heads the council's Education and Libraries panel.
``I've known him since I served on the school board, and he'll be
able to continue what Ms. McKenzie started.''
   Jenkins was chosen over former Richmond school chief Richard
Hunter.

   An elderly man says his Volkswagen had
lapped up nearly a million road miles before it was squashed like a
bug under an overturned beer truck.
   The 1966 Volkswagen had traveled about 950,000 miles based on
odometer readings before the accident Monday, owner Forrest Varing
said.
   ``Baby was about to make (1 million miles) but she flattened out
in the stretch,'' Varing, 67, said. He suffered only minor cuts in
the accident and the truck driver was unhurt.
   Both vehicles were traveling on a curved connecting ramp when
the truck, carrying a 22{-ton load of suds, overturned, crushing
the Volkswagen.
   ``It was the craziest accident I've ever seen and the beauty of
it was nobody got hurt,'' said California Highway Patrol Officer
John Anderson.
   Varing admitted not all the miles registered on the car's
odometer were driving miles, saying it was often towed behind other
cars during travels for his auto delivery business.
   Topping the Guinness Book of World Records car-mileage list is a
1957 Mercedes-Benz with 1,184,880 verified miles.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says He Has Offered Peace Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi says he has
presented Sudanese rebels with a proposal to end the country's
five-year civil war, a magazine reported Tuesday.
   In an interview with the weekly al-Ashiqa, el-Mahdi said he
outlined the peace plan in a message to John Garang, leader of the
Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   He gave no details of the plan, saying only that it was conveyed
by Foreign Minister Hussein Suleiman Abu-Saleh.
   The government meanwhile said its forces overran 12 rebel
positions in the Upper Nile province near the border with Ethiopia,
killing 300 rebels.
   Major General Abdul-Jalil al-Musharaf, commander of the fifth
infantry division in Kordofan, said that only three government
soldiers were killed in the fighting. Several rebels were taken
prisoner and a large amount of arms and ammunition were captured,
he said.
   He told the official Sudan news agency SUNA the military
operation was part of a plan to cripple rebel activities in South
Korddofan during the approaching rainy season.
   He did not say when exactly the fighting took place.
   Abu-Saleh, the foreign minister, is currently in Ethiopia's
capital, Addis Ababa, for a meeting of the Ministerial Council of
the Organization of African Unity, or OAU. He met on Monday with
President Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia, whom Sudan repeatedly
has charged with backing the Sudanese rebellion.
   It was not clear whether el-Mahdi's message to Garang was given
to Mengistu for relay or was delivered in some other way. Garang is
known to have a base of operations inside neighboring Ethiopia.
   El-Mahdi told al-Ashiqa that he would be prepared to meet with
Garang if the rebel leader responded favorably to the peace
proposal.
   El-Mahdi, due in Addis Ababa Wednesday for the OAU summit, said
he also will hold talks with Mengistu on bilateral relations.
   Since el-Mahdi took office in 1986, his government has held
several rounds of preliminary peace talks with the rebels in
Britain and Ethiopia. All the sessions failed.
   Garang is a former army colonel educated in the United States.
   His army began fighting five years ago in Sudan's three southern
provinces, where most people are Christian or animist. They demand
autonomy and economic reforms from the government, which is
dominated by the Moslems of the predominantly Arab north.

<HEAD>New PTL Trustee Says Contributions Are Drying Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL will have to go off the air and close
its theme park as early as next month if contributions to the
television ministry keep dwindling, the new trustee told a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court judge Tuesday.
   After the hearing, PTL contributors made tearful pleas to
trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to allow banished PTL founder Jim
Bakker to appear on the cable TV network to solicit donations they
said would save the ministry.
   ``Everybody else has tried and failed _ why not Bakker?'' said
Paul Wood, a spokesman for a group of PTL's Lifetime Partners, the
major contributors to the ministry.
   Bakker resigned in March 1987 as the story of his tryst with
Jessica Hahn and her hush money payments was about to break. He
turned over control to the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who resigned in
October after accusing Bakker of using ministry funds to live
lavishly.
   Wood said contributors he represents had pledged $81 million
that would be turned over to the ministry once Bakker was allowed
on the PTL network ``to ask for forgiveness.''
   Benton told the contributors, several of them weeping as they
pleaded with him in the courtroom, that his objective was to save
PTL.
   ``My primary duty is to get the creditors paid,'' he added.
   PTL, with current debts of about $130 million and assets of $160
million, filed for reorganization and protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court in June 1987. Benton, who was appointed Friday to
succeed former Christian Broadcasting Network executive David Clark
as trustee, was in court to gain approval of a plan to liquidate
assets to the extent necessary to pay debts.
   After telling the judge about the ministry's declining income he
said, ``The next step is to shut down, and that I'm prepared to
do.''
   But Benton said after the hearing he wouldn't rule out the
proposal allowing Bakker's limited return once he saw it in
writing, ``if it's the best and logical next step for the
ministry.''
   PTL attorney Bradford Leggett said if the contributors had as
much financial backing as they claim, the logical thing to do would
be to put their money together and present a proposal to buy PTL
and pay its debts.
   Wood acknowledged later that they couldn't raise the money
without getting Bakker on the network.
   In the hearing before Judge Rufus Reynolds, Benton said, ``We're
considerably short of money now, and we're going to have to have
some money soon to operate. Contributions have about dried up.''
   In the past three weeks, contributions have dwindled from
$60,000 a day to $40,000 a day to $22,000 a day last week, Benton
said. It costs $27,000 a day just to pay the network affiliates, he
said later.
   ``We have the problem of keeping the doors open,'' Benton
testified, adding that they also may not be able to keep airing the
``PTL Club'' TV show, the primary method of gathering contributions
that pay for operating expenses.
   Marjorie Gray, a Lifetime Partner who said she has donated
$36,000 to PTL, told Benton that the reason people stopped giving
is that they aren't happy with the leadership.
   She also said contributors are disheartened by PTL's
negotiations with non-religious buyers _ including National
Basketball Association expansion franchise owner George Shinn, who
wants to build a sports complex on the grounds.
   Reynolds said he approved the concept of a revised
reorganization plan filed last week that called for the trustee to
liquidate PTL's assets as necessary. The proposal outlined plans to
sell the 2,300-acre Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill and allow
a separate, non-profit corporation lease the property required to
operate its church and network television programs.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
and members of the major political parties on Tuesday rejected a
proposal by leftist rebels to hold a new round of peace talks next
week.
   Rafael Moran Castaneda, who belongs to the National Conciliation
Party, said that ``it is not the opportune moment'' to hold
discussions with the guerrillas' Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front and its political ally, the Democratic
Revolutionary Front.
   He said the political parties need to resolve a dispute over
control of the National Assembly that has prevented installation of
the 60-member congress elected March 20.
   ``This situation must first be overcome in order to be able to
give a show of unity,'' Moran Castaneda said.
   Col. Carlos Figueroa, a member of the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance or Arena, said, ``We have decided that first
the assembly has to be formed, and that is where we are going to
work out the peace proposal.''
   The rebels earlier this month offered to resume talks to try to
end the 8{-year war with the U.S.-supported government. An
estimated 65,000 people, the majority of them civilians, have died
in the civil war.
   The guerrilla front is a coalition of five rebel armies. It is
closely allied with the Democratic Revolutionary Front, a loose
federation of leftist parties, groups and student and peasant
unions.
   The rebels called for Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of San Salvador, to mediate the talks.
   Government and rebel representatives last met Oct. 20 in San
Salvador. Two rounds of talks held in 1984 ended in a stalemate.
   Duarte and representatives of the armed forces and major
political parties began a series of meetings last week aimed at
working out a peace proposal to offer the rebels.
   Moran Castaneda said those meetings will continue.
   The crisis in the legislature centers on who controls the
majority of deputies.
   Thirty deputies of Arena took their seats May 1 and claim to
have constituted the assembly.
   Duarte's Christian Democrats contend that Arena lacks the
majority necessary to install the legislature. The Christian
Democrats were resoundingly defeated in the legislative election,
losing their parliamentary majority.
   The Christian Democrats and the Conciliation party, who claim 30
deputies between them, have formed an informal alliance to block
Arena's control of the legislature.
   One of the Christian Democrats' 23 deputies is claimed by Arena,
which charges the seat was stolen through electoral fraud.

   Retired Vice Adm. Cesar Augusto
Guzzetti, who was foreign minister under Argentina's last military
regime, has died after a long illness, his family said Tuesday. He
was 62.
   Guzzetti, who died Monday, became foreign minister after a coup
on March 24, 1976 replaced the government of Isabel Peron with a
military junta that ruled through Argentina's ``dirty war'' years
until 1983.
   In May 1977, Guzzetti was seriously wounded during an attack by
leftist guerrillas who were seeking to overthrow the right-wing
military government. The guerrillas tried to kidnap Guzzetti while
he was visiting a doctor. They struck him on the head, badly
hurting him.
   Guzzetti resigned from office soon after the incident and went
to the United States for treatment, but remained debilitated the
rest of his life.
   He was buried in Buenos Aires with military honors.

   Three small plane crashes left one man dead and 10 injured
Tuesday and six others were injured when severe weather buffeted a
Braniff Airlines jet on its approach to Orlando, Fla.
   The Braniff jet landed safely and none of the injuries from the
four incidents appeared to be life-threatening.
   Meanwhile, a Taca International Airlines Boeing 737 lost power
in both engines while making an approach in heavy thunderstorms and
glided to a safe landing near an abandoned airstrip 24 miles short
of New Orleans International Airport. None of the 36 passengers and
nine crew members was hurt.
   In Pontiac, Mich., the pilot of a home-built airplane died after
his aircraft crashed at Oakland-Pontiac Airport, officials said.
The other crashes occurred during a commuter plane's takeoff in
Lawton, Okla., and after a U.S. Customs Service plane lost power
outside San Angelo, Texas.
   Police identified the victim as Harold R. Chappell Jr., 48, of
Ortonville, whose plane crashed at 3:07 p.m. EDT.
   Chappell died after two hours of surgery at Pontiac Osteopathic
Hospital, said Dr. David Malicke, an emergency room physician.
   Chappell was circling the airport when a section of material
covering one wing peeled away from the wooden frame, causing a loss
of lift and sending the plane into a spin, police said.
   In Oklahoma, an Atlantic Southeast Airlines commuter plane
crashed on takeoff from Lawton Municipal Airport, injuring the six
passengers and two crew members aboard, authorities said.
   ``I saw smoke pop up and had no idea where it was from,'' said
Sissy Anderson, a receptionist at Jet Away, an aircraft servicing
and maintenance company. ``They say it was taking off, bounced down
and hit the ground, bounced and hit again before the fire broke.''
   There were unconfirmed reports the 18-passenger Bandarante
plane, which authorities said was bound for Dallas, lost an engine
on takeoff.
   Two people were in serious condition at Comanche County Memorial
Hospital and a third person was listed in good condition, said
spokeswoman Kelly Brack.
   Brad Mitchell, a spokesman at Southwestern Medical Center, said
three people were in stable condition with cuts and bruises and two
others were being examined.
   Braniff's Flight 723 carrying 55 passengers from Indianapolis
was hit by heavy rain and winds at 13,000 feet and about 35 miles
west of Orlando International Airport, an airline official said.
   ``The seatbelt signs were on, but it happened suddenly,'' said
Braniff Vice President Jim Thomson.
   The BAC-111, two-engine aircraft landed safely without any
emergency procedures shortly before 4 p.m. EDT and did not appear
to be damaged, he said.
   Four passengers and two flight attendants were in stable
condition with cuts and bruises that did not appear serious, said
Joe Brown, spokesman for Orlando Regional Medical Center.
   Two flight attendants were treated for minor cuts and abrasions
and released from Humana Lucerne Hospital, said spokesman Larry
Harrell.
   The National Weather Service reported a band of thunderstorms
hit central Florida during the afternoon.
   Boaters rescued two men after a U.S. Customs Service plane lost
power in both engines and crashed into a lake outside San Angelo,
Texas, officials said.
   A pilot and a student pilot were practicing takeoffs and
landings from Mathis Field when their Cessna lost power, said
Charles Conroy, a Customs spokesman in Houston.
   The men were being treated at Angelo Community Hospital, but
their injuries were not considered to be life-threatening, nursing
supervisor Mike Wood said. Conroy said the men, whose names were
not released, suffered facial cuts.

<HEAD>Soldiers Kills Melanesian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French soldier on patrol shot and
killed a Melanesian Tuesday on the east coast of this French
Pacific territory, officials said.
   Because of the shooting, a meeting between leaders of the
separatist Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front and a special
government commission from Paris was postponed.
   Officials said the shooting happened about 2:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m.
Monday) near the village of Touho, about 210 miles northeast of
Noumea.
   A statement from the army said the soldiers saw a light, then
discovered two Melanesians, one carrying a weapon. When the other
one made a move toward his pocket, ``a soldier, feeling threatened,
opened fire and mortally wounded one of the two men,'' the army
said.
   New Caledonia, 1,000 miles east of Australia, has been the scene
of sporadic violence since November 1984. The latest upsurge began
in April when Melanesian separatists attacked a police station on
the island of Ouvea, killed four policemen and abducted two dozen
others.
   On May 5, French security forces stormed the cave where the
hostages were being held, killing 19 Melanesians and freeing the
captives. Two soldiers died.
   Last week, Premier Michel Rocard sent a special six-member
mission to New Caledonia to re-establish a dialogue with residents.
   ``No dialogue, no negotiation can take place as long as a state
of war imposed by the armed forces continues,'' said a statement
from the Kanak front's politburo after the meeting was postponed.
   The army said it was investigating the shooting death.
   Native Melanesians, or Kanaks, represent about 43 percent of New
Caledonia's 145,000 residents, and most of them favor independence.
The rest of the population is made up of European settlers, Asians
and Polynesians, most of whom prefer to remain French.
   Meanwhile, in Paris, there was continued controversy over the
May 5 assault on the cave, which the Socialists claim was carried
out under political pressure from the conservative government then
in power to enhance the presidential election prospects of Premier
Jacques Chirac.
   Chirac lost to President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist.
   Over the weekend, the newspaper Le Monde published excerpts from
a confidential report written by Maj. Philippe Legorjus, head of a
French anti-terrorist squad that made the assault. Le Monde said
Legorjus was critical of government officials for rejecting
negotiations in favor of military action.
   Bernard Pons, the former minister for overseas territories who
was in charge of the operation, said Tuesday the account was
``twisted and deformed,'' and asked that the complete report be
published.

   The ``Romeo and Juliet'' which opened Tuesday at
off-Broadway's Public Theater may not be the most riveting of
revivals, but its lack of excitement can't be blamed on the actors
who play Shakespeare's star-crossed lovers.
   Peter MacNicol and Cynthia Nixon bring a passion to their roles,
a conviction and sense of purpose that is missing from the rest of
this diffuse production, mismanaged by director Les Waters.
   The pint-sized MacNicol, who would seem to be an unlikely
leading man, brandishes a boyish enthusiasm in keeping with Romeo's
impulsiveness. He's quick-tempered, argumentative and ardent in his
pursuit of Juliet. The play's inevitable tragedy seems logical
given the actions of this most emotional of Romeos.
   Miss Nixon is a radiant Juliet. She matches MacNicol in
intensity. What's more, her voice is better equipped to handle the
poetry, and she gives the language its due.
   When the two lovers are on stage together, the play exerts
interest if not a complete fascination. Unfortunately, there's the
rest of Verona and all those feuding Montagues and Captulets to
watch and worry about.
   What Waters has assembled is a polyglot cast and he imposed no
discernible sense of style. The accents range from Brooklyn to
Dublin and points in between. The acting at times seems more
suitable for ``West Side Story'' or, in one case of disastrous
overplaying, ``La Cage aux folles.''
   The actors are at sea. Those who sink include an affected
Courtney B. Vance who flounces his way through the role of
Mercutio; Milo O'Shea who turns Friar Lawrence into a cardboard
Barry Fitzgerald; Anne Meara who substitutes grimaces for emotion,
and W.B. Brydon's Capulet who bullies and bellows his way through
the play, spraying the other actors and everyone sitting in the
first row.
   The actors who succeed, particularly Peter Francis James as
Benvolio and Bradley Whitford as Paris, do so because their
performances are low-key and serve the story, not themselves.
   Heidi Landesman has designed an odd setting, a white, high-tech
balcony that wouldn't look out of place in a Soho loft. It cuts
across a large crumbling red column that suggests a decaying and
corrupt Renaissance society. The two ideas don't quite mesh.
   The exuberant sword fights were devised by B.H. Barry, and they
are models of stage fencing, particularly Romeo's unnerving battle
with Tybalt.
   ``Romeo and Juliet'' is the third production in the Public
Theater's Shakespeare marathon. The theater will present all 36 of
Shakespeare's plays during a six-year period.
   In quality, Waters' production falls somewhere between the
Public's exotic and entertaining ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' and
its dismal, all-star ``Julius Caesar.'' This ``Romeo and Juliet''
can be savored for its lovers only.

<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels killed eight Indian
soldiers in northern Sri Lanka and suffered 20 to 25 casualties
themselves, Indian diplomats said Tuesday.
   The diplomats cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   They said six Indian soldiers, including an officer, were killed
and all the Tamil casualties occurred when the Indians raided a
rebel hideout on Monday near Mullaitivu town, 120 miles northeast
of Colombo.
   They did not know how many of the 20-25 Tamils were killed and
how many wounded.
   A bomb explosion on Tuesday killed two Indian soldiers and
wounded two at Palali village, 12 miles northeast of Jaffna town,
the diplomats said.
   The deaths raised to at least 441 the number of Indian troops
killed in Sri Lanka since October, when the troops began an
offensive against Tamil rebels.
   More than 50,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka under an accord
signed in July 1987 by India and Sri Lanka to end the Tamil
separatist guerrilla war for a homeland in the north and east of
the Indian Ocean island nation.
   The peace pact has been rejected by the most powerful of the
Tamil groups, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   The agreement grants some autonomy to the Tamil minority in
exchange for a surrender of arms by the rebels.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up for 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. The Sinhalese, who are Buddhists,
account for about 75 percent.
   The Tamil say the Sinhalese, who control the government and the
military, discriminate against them.

   Jorge Obrador Capellini began work Tuesday as
Mexico City's acting police chief following the dismissal of 10 top
police commanders due to allegations of a torture death.
   The Federal District attorney general, Renato Sales Gasque, said
at Obrador Capellini's swearing in ceremony late Monday, ``We will
not tolerate acts of corruption nor any act that could affect the
credibility that the community must have in the judicial police of
this city.''
   Earlier Monday the firing of Jesus Miyazawa, director of the
city's judicial police; five deputy directors and four commanders
was announced in connection with an investigation into the death of
a police official in the adjoining state of Mexico.
   The government news agency Notimex quoted Sales Gasque as saying
the dismissals occurred because of acts ``against the dignity of a
person.'' It said the attorney general would give details at a news
conference this week.
   Authorities said Pablo Estanislao Aguilar Alcala, a judicial
police commander in the state of Mexico, was tortured to death last
week, possibly in a revenge killing by members of the Mexico City
judicial police.
   A statement from the attorney general's office said, ``What
happened compels (Sales Gasque) to take this decision, with the aim
moreover of thoroughly restructuring the department of the judicial
police of (Mexico City).''
   The Federal District makes up the core of the Mexico City
metropolitan area of more than 18 million people. It is surrounded
on three sides by the state of Mexico. Many of the area's teeming
slums and rapidly growing suburbs are in that jurisdiction.
   The liberal daily La Jornada said in a front-page editorial
Tuesday that ``the abyss of police criminality causes vertigo'' and
that a full investigation would find that the case prompting the
dismissal was not the only incident of wrongdoing.
   President Miguel de la Madrid, who completes his six-year term
this year, has made ``moral renewal'' in government a cornerstone
of his administration.

<TEXT>
   Fire broke out Tuesday at an oil tank
farm and threatened to ignite millions of gallons of gasoline
before it was brought under control. At least 20,000 Mexicans fled
their homes and one estimate said 200,000 were evacuated.
   A spiral of fire and smoke soared more than 150 feet above the
oil-products storage area of the government oil monopoly Pemex in
the northern residential area of Chihuahua, a state capital in
northern Mexico with 550,000 people.
   But the only casualties reported were a few firefighters with
``light burns.'' Authorities reported that the blaze began at 10:10
a.m. (12:12 p.m. EDT) and was brought under control about eight
hours later.
   At about 8 p.m., residents were told they could return home,
said Francisco Cortez Coronado, a Pemex spokesman.
   He added, ``The causes (for the explosion and fire) are not real
clear. They are still investigating. What we do know is that two
men were soldering to repair a line at the base of the tank and
that the top part exploded.''
   Alfonso Sanchez Gallo, the Chihuahua state government's chief
spokesman, said in a telephone interview Tuesday evening,
``Everything is perfectly controlled and there is no risk that the
fire might spread to other tanks.''
   Flames continued to shoot up and thick black smoke poured from
the 39-foot- high steel tank more than nine hours after the
explosion. The top of the tank collapsed inward from the fierce
heat.
   There were scorch marks from the fire on a tank 30 yards away.
   The government news agency Notimex said the burning tank, with a
capacity of 1,260,000 gallons, contained an extremely light
petroleum while 14 other tanks, with a capacity of 1,040,000
gallons each, held gasoline. Four were ``very close'' to the
burning tank, it said.
   ``There was an explosion but it was very muffled, and then the
fire started,'' said plant foreman Arturo Rubio.
   The initial report from Pemex headquarters in Mexico City said
the blast came at 11:20 a.m. (1:20 p.m. EDT), but Cortez Coronado
later said it was 10:10 a.m.
   The site lies in a densely populated area, about eight miles
north of the city center.
   Estimates varied widely as to how many residents were affected.
   Reporters at the newspaper Novedades de Chihuahua said about
20,000 people left their homes.
   Notimex quoted local fire department commander Mario Perez as
saying soldiers, police and volunteers evacuated more than 100,000
people from a two-mile radius around the plant.
   Later, Notimex gave its own estimate of 200,000 people evacuated.
   Luis Alonso Hernandez, 26, a worker at the plant, said, ``You
could see the flames and black smoke from miles away. And there
were all kinds of accidents in the road. The whole city was
running.''
   Spokesman Sanchez Gallo said officials were concerned that
shooting flames would touch off a nearby gasoline tank, adding ``It
was a question of cooling off the other tank.''
   He reported that the 300 firefighters were draining gasoline
from the 14 other tanks and, ``There is no risk that the fire might
spread to neighboring tanks, since they are being chilled with
strong sprays of cold water.''
   Red Cross radio dispatcher Olga Rojo said efforts to control the
blaze were initially hampered by a scarcity of water. Much of
northern Mexico is suffering from drought this season.
   Chihuahua lies 233 miles south of the Texas border at El Paso.
It is the capital of sprawling Chihuahua state, the largest of
Mexico's 31 states.
   Notimex said plans had called for the storage tanks to be
relocated some months ago, but new facilities have not been
completed. It said area residents had been protesting Pemex's
presence there.
   On Nov. 19, 1984, more than 500 people were killed at an
explosion of storage tanks owned by Pemex in San Juan Ixhuatepec, a
working class neighborhood on the northern outskirts of Mexico City.

   More than 11,000 people evacuated after a
fire destroyed a metal plating building containing vats of deadly
cyanide were allowed back homes Tuesday.
   No toxic cloud formed and no injuries were reported as a result
of the fire that broke out early Monday at Builder's Hardware
Finishers Inc., a metal plating company that stored 26,000 gallons
of chemicals, including cyanide.
   Authorities evacuated a 14-square-block area around the facility
in northeast Los Angeles until a private disposal company removed
the chemicals under the watch of federal Environmental Protection
Agency officials.
   Emergency shelters were set up at various locations, including a
Red Cross refuge under the bleachers at Dodger Stadium. The last 29
people there munched on doughnuts at dawn and were bused home.
   Schools in the area reopened Tuesday and the neighborhood was
``pretty well back to normal,'' said police Sgt. Charles Willig.

<HEAD>Ortega Insists Peace Talks Be Held In Managua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega late Tuesday
renewed his demand that peace talks scheduled to begin Wednesday
with the Contra rebels take place in Managua.
   The U.S.-backed rebels said they intended to meet with
negotiators of the leftist Sandinista government in the small
village of Sapoa on the Costa Rican border.
   But Ortega said that holding the discussions in Sapoa ``would be
to put the conversations at the brink of breaking off.'' The two
sides signed a preliminary peace plan in the village on March 23.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the archbishop of Managua who
has been an observer in the talks, said, ``I believe that the
meeting is doubtful'' because the two sides are deadlocked on the
site.
   He said Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general of the Organization
of American States, who has mediated the discussions, called off
his trip to Managua because of the disagreement.
   ``A regrettable impasse has arisen in the conversations,''
Obando y Bravo said.
   Ortega said Baena Soares ``is ready to come to Nicaragua as soon
as it is confirmed that the meeting will take place in Managua.''
   The Contras have resisted holding the three days of talks in
Managua.
   They have complained that during two previous sessions, the
government kept them cooped up in a hotel near the airport on the
outskirts of Managua and refused to let them move about freely in
the capital and meet with domestic opposition groups.
   But Ortega said Tuesday that the Contras would be allowed to
meet with officials of opposition political parties, the Roman
Catholic Church and the opposition newspaper La Prensa. Moreover,
he said, their relatives could visit them at the hotel.
   To meet in Sapoa, the president said, would mark ``a setback in
political terms.''
   ``It would be to accept that all that has been achieved since
the first contacts (late last year) can be lost,'' he said.
   The two sides have been trying since the initial peace agreement
was arranged to work out details for a permanent cease-fire. They
agreed on a 60-day truce to give them time to negotiate a lasting
cease-fire.
   Ortega announced Monday that he would extend unilaterally the
temporary truce, due to run out on May 30, an additional 30 days.
   The peace talks are designed to bring an end to the more than
six years of war between the Sandinistas and the Contras. Ortega
has said the fighting has killed 26,500 people and caused $3
billion in damage to the economy.
   In Washington Tuesday, an aide to House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, said the Contras planned to offer to lay down their arms
on Sept. 1 as part of a comprehensive peace accord to be presented
to the Nicaraguan government Wednesday.

   In February 1986, a young couple kidnapped
Lucille Knight and took her to a town hundreds of miles from her
home, federal authorities say.
   The young couple allegedly kept Mrs. Knight passive by feeding
her drugs while they stole her retirement checks and stripped her
assets. They ended up bilking her of more than $100,000, according
to an indictment.
   ``They destroyed everything I had,'' Mrs. Knight, 83, said
Tuesday. ``All I brought back was a car.''
   Mrs. Knight was finally rescued after four months when her
brother, who was also a captive, slipped a letter to a mail carrier.
   Her niece contacted the Catoosa County Sheriff's Department, and
Larry Black, then chief of detectives, said Tuesday he went to the
home and took Mrs. Knight back to the county jail where she was
reunited with her relatives.
   Black, who has since left full-time law enforcement, said he
notified the FBI of the incident.
   ``I didn't report it,'' said Mrs. Knight, although her neighbors
knew what had happened. Mrs. Knight said she wasn't frightened, but
she didn't trust Louisiana law enforcement authorities.
   Terry Lee Barrett, 29, and Alice Virginia Barrett, 31, were not
arrested until Saturday in New Orleans, and U.S. Attorney Robert
Barr said Tuesday the couple is being held on $100,000 bond.
   The Barretts were indicted here May 10 on kidnapping, fraud and
conspiracy charges for allegedly abducting Mrs. Knight from her
trailer park home in Hammond, La., about 40 miles northwest of New
Orleans.
   The indictment, unsealed after the arrests, alleges the Barretts
took Mrs. Knight to a house in Ringgold, Ga., a suburb of
Chattanooga, Tenn., more than 500 miles from Hammond.
   The Barretts allegedly administered Valium, Quaaludes, Percodan
and laxatives while they stole her retirement and Social Security
checks and stripped Mrs. Knight's bank accounts and investments.
   ``They kept me doped up most all the time I was there,'' said
Mrs. Knight in a telephone interview from Hammond. ``I couldn't
stand up; I couldn't walk; I couldn't do anything.''
   The indictment said the couple stole $101,875.72. If convicted,
they could be sentenced to life in prison and fined $2 million.
Barr said they will be arraigned within the next few days.
   Mrs. Knight said Tuesday that her brother, who has since died,
was also held.
   She said she met the Barretts in Hammond through her brother,
and she was rescued when she wrote a note to her niece and her
brother slipped it to a mail carrier.
   ``I didn't know they had taken everything I had'' until Black
took her from the Barretts' clutches, said Mrs. Knight. She
returned to Hammond and has been living there ever since, and said
she has suffered no lingering effects from the drugs.
   She lives on Social Security and retirement checks from
California, where she was a hospital worker.
   Mrs. Knight said she and her husband moved from Oxnard, Calif.,
to Louisiana in 1977, but he died two years later and ``I got stuck
here. I don't need to be here at all. I need to be on the West
Coast.
   ``I just live around here wondering from day to day what's going
to happen to me. I try to stay in my trailer and go when I have to
go, (but) I have nowhere to go, nowhere I want to go.''

   The five major navies of the world now have
about 16,000 nuclear weapons assigned to them, including roughly
6,500 ``non-strategic'' warheads that are not covered by any type
of arms control treaty, according to a new study.
   ``The nuclear arms race at sea is longstanding, and
accelerating,'' the study concludes. ``As of the end of 1987, 1,101
ships and submarines and over 3,250 aircraft (could) fire,
transport or service one or more of these nuclear weapons.
   ``And all of the nuclear powers have ongoing nuclear research
and development programs and are producing new naval nuclear
weapons, as well as the ships, aircraft and missiles that carry or
launch nuclear warheads.''
   The study, which focuses on the navies of the United States,
Soviet Union, England, France and China, is entitled ``Nuclear
Warships and Naval Nuclear Weapons: A Complete Inventory'' and was
published today by the Institute for Policy Studies and the
environmental group Greenpeace.

   The extent of chemotherapy needed to cure
testicular cancer can safely be reduced by 25 percent, sparing men
from some of the misery of the effective but difficult treatment, a
study has found.
   Experts say the discovery represents another advance in the
treatment of one of the few highly curable adult cancers.
   Cancer of the testicles is rare, accounting for about 1 percent
of all male malignancies. However, it is the most common cancer
among men between the ages of 15 and 35.
   In the study, Dr. Lawrence H. Einhorn of Indiana University
found that the standard course of chemotherapy can be cut from four
months to three and still cure about 95 percent of patients.
   ``We can now eliminate that fourth course of therapy, reducing
costs, side effects and patient inconvenience,'' he said Monday at
the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

   Paul served up his shrimp creole, Brad grilled
some steaks, and Maida brought her favorite brownies. Fifteen more
people crowded into the kitchen, baking hors d'oeuvres, heating
soup, tossing salads, whipping up more desserts.
   Whoa, folks! Too many cooks!
   But wait a minute. These are not ordinary cooks. They are 18 of
America's finest chefs and, in their rarified world of toques and
wire whisks and $300 pots, they know better than to spoil the broth.
   The chefs and their helpers from Boston to San Francisco and
from New Orleans to the Michigan lakeshore thronged the vast
kitchen of the Capital Hilton Hotel on Monday night to prepare a
``gourmet gala'' of their specialties for 750 guests.
   Proceeds from the $250-a-plate benefit went to the March of
Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, which is celebrating its 50th
anniversary this year.

   President Reagan combined praise with
criticism for the Kremlin on Tuesday in advance of the superpower
summit, while the White House prodded the Senate to ratify a
U.S.-Soviet arms treaty before the president arrives in Moscow this
weekend.
   Senate leaders, trying to spare Reagan the embarrassment of
meeting Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev without a ratified
treaty, announced plans to cut off debate on the accord, which bans
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which Reagan and
Gorbachev signed Dec. 8, seems assured of approval by an
overwhelming majority, but has been stalled by a handful of
opponents.

   President Reagan's decision to stop in Finland
for three days before the Moscow summit sent his hosts scurrying
for ways to entertain him in grand style. They even promised him an
audience with Santa Claus.
   St. Nick lives in Rovaniemi, a snowy town snuggled against the
Arctic Circle in Finnish Lapland, according to Finland's tourist
board and the local postmen who received 354,136 letters addressed
to Santa in 1987.
   When Finnish Prime Minister Harri Holkeri visited the White
House recently, he proposed a meeting between Reagan and Santa
during the president's three-night stopover in Helsinki.

   A ranking official said Tuesday the Communist
Party may limit leaders to two five-year terms, ending the
perpetual tenure that cements personal power, but he did not
indicate it would apply to Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``This is a big step in the development of intraparty
democracy,'' said Karl Vayno, party chief for the republic of
Estonia.
   Gorbachev has said he favors restrictions on tenure. Terms for
party leaders now are unlimited and longevity is a tool officials
at the local, retional and nation levels use to build power and
privilege.

   Sailors searching a swamp near the
airport in the seaside city of Cartagena on Tuesday captured a
hijacker who commandeered a jet across the Americas and demanded
$100,000 and an audience with Mother Teresa.
   The navy said Gonzalo Carreno Nieto was found hiding in mangrove
roots about 300 yards from a Cartagena airport runway, still
clutching the toy grenade he had used to hijack an Avianca airlines
Boeing 727 on Monday morning while on a domestic flight from the
drug capital of Medellin to Bogota.
   The hijack began shortly after 9 a.m. when Carreno diverted the
plane back to Medellin, where he freed all 128 passengers and three
flight attendants. He then ordered the cockpit crew into the sky on
a trip that took the aircraft to Panama, where it was refueled,
then to the island of Aruba off Venezuela and back to Colombia when
the pilot persuaded him they couldn't make it to Cuba.

his favor as he seeks to unseat Republican Sen. Pete Wilson this
year _ ``The Jinx.''
   For more than 30 years, no one has been re-elected to the Senate

defeated and descended into political oblivion. By contrast,
Democrat Alan Cranston is flourishing in his fourth term holding
down the state's other seat.
   ``Everybody talks about `The Jinx,''' said Craig Schmidt, a

Wilson, not surprisingly, agrees: ``I think it's nonsense, a myth.
We're going to prove it's not true.'

   What's cooking at the National Restaurant
Association convention? The debate du jour is whether to tip or not
to tip.
   Some restaurateurs are calling for a switch to a flat service
charge, as is common in Europe. But many find the idea unappetizing.
   A federal tax law that went into effect Jan. 1 requires
restaurants to pay taxes on waiters' tips. And if waiters fudge on
the amount of tips they get, the Internal Revenue Service can hold
restaurants liable for taxes on the unreported gratuities.

   Tass doesn't call him a ``lunatic'' any more, nor
does Pravda compare Ronald Reagan to the Nazis _ a particularly
cutting label in a country that cannot forget it lost 20 million
people to the Nazis in World War II.
   In fact, the Russians have come to look upon Reagan as
trustworthy, even grandfatherly.
   Although still hardly immune to criticism, the American
president is being shown to the Soviet people as a less
confrontational figure as he prepares to visit Moscow for his
fourth summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Reagan, because of his strong anti-communist views before he
became president in 1981, had long been the target of strident
criticism in the Soviet media. But his image has matured and grown
more complex and human during the period of Gorbachev's
``glasnost,'' or greater openness.
   Characterizations of foreign leaders by the state-run press are
particularly important in the Soviet Union because citizens have
little else on which to base their impressions. Few have contact
with foreigners or access to foreign publications. Until recently
broadcasts of foreign radio stations were jammed.
   Reagan's anti-communism, as filtered through the official media,
gave Russians a ``first image'' as ``this hostile, even brutal man,
much in the American cowboy mold _ shoot first and ask questions
later,'' Soviet radio and TV commentator Vladimir Pozner said in an
interview.
   And the Soviet media made much of the president's own harshest
comments, such as his March 8, 1983, description of the Soviet
Union as an ``evil empire.''
   After Reagan offered that description in a speech to Christian
Evangelists, the Soviet news agency Tass said Reagan's
administration thought only in terms of ``confrontation and
bellicose, lunatic anti-communism.''
   Seven months later, following the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada,
Tass commentator Konstantin Kuryev said Reagan's explanation for
the undertaking was made with ``the simple-mindedness
characteristic of him.''
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, compared Reagan to a Nazi,
which has an especially derogatory in Russia.
   In August 1984, after Reagan's inadvertantly recorded _ and
humorously intended _ remark that the United States would begin
bombing the Soviet Union in five minutes, the Soviet government
fumed in a statement issued through the official press that
Reagan's words were ``unprecendentedly hostile toward the USSR and
dangerous to the course of peace.''
   But the official image of Reagan began to warm with the coming
of the 1985 Geneva summit, the first face-to-face meeting of U.S.
and Soviet leaders in more than a decade.
   And Reagan's own description of his attitude toward dealing with
the Soviets _ ``Trust, but verify'' _ was shown to millions of
Soviet and American television viewers alike during Gorbachev's
visit to Washington last December. The remark could be used as well
to sum up the cautious but constructive atmosphere the Soviet media
have built around superpower relations in the last years of
Reagan's presidency.
   During the Geneva summit, Soviet television began to broadcast
appearances by Reagan. His picture appeared for the first time on
the front page of Pravda.
   Reagan started coming across to Soviets ``as a more homemade,
grandfatherly gentleman, perhaps not the greatest mind in the
world, but not as threatening as he was once perceived,'' Pozner
said.
   Moscow resident Anna Likhacheva, 64, told The Associated Press
at the tiime of the Geneva summit that, ``It seems to me from the
expression on his face that he does not favor bad relations. But I
think a small circle of bad people influence him.''
   Pozner said Gorbachev's emphasis on greater openness has allowed
Soviet media to give more than just a one-dimensional treatment to
Reagan. ``We're doing a better job than we did before. Basically I
think the media is being fairer,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, the commentator added, Reagan would win few
popularity contests among Soviet citizens.
   But after the last summit in December, Soviet television viewers
heard Gorbachev tell a Washington news conference: ``I think we now
have more understanding between the president and myself ... It's
more business-like, it's more of a constructive approach. And I'll
even venture to say that I think we trust each other more.''
   The softer treatment in general doesn't mean Reagan is immune to
criticism on the issues that divide the superpowers. Soviet media
still strikes back when he attacks Soviet foreign and human rights
policies.
   And after Reagan's critical foreign policy speech in
Springfield, Mass. in April, the official media gave wide display
to Gorbachev's retort that ``we are not going to re-educate the
United States and do not recognize that it has any right to
re-educate us.''

<HEAD>TV Movie Depicts Fight to Build Vietnam Veterans Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't ego or politics that led Jan Scruggs
to build a memorial to the Vietnam veterans in Washington.
   It was a chance meeting with another veteran at a fast-food
restaurant not long after they had come home. Both had known
another soldier who was killed in Vietnam. Scruggs was haunted by
the fact that neither could remember the soldier's name.
   The scene is part of the movie ``To Heal a Nation'' which NBC
will air this Sunday, appropriately enough on Memorial Day weekend.
It is a different kind of Vietnam movie, about Scruggs' battle to
win a memorial to those who fought an unpopular war.
   Scruggs is played by Eric Roberts, a 1985 Oscar nominee for the
movie ``Runaway Train.'' The movie is based on the book Scruggs
wrote with Joel Swerdlow.
   Since its dedication on Veterans Day 1982, ``the wall,'' as it
is known, has become one of the most popular monuments in
Washington, attracting up to 20,000 visitors a day.
   The unconventional design of the memorial was highly
controversial when it was unveiled _ a low black granite V cut
below ground level that draws visitors into it, then reflects their
images in the shiny surface etched with the names of those who died.
   In the movie, Scruggs receives a letter from a youngster whose
father died in the conflict. The boy encloses $5 his father gave
him to buy a hamburger the day he left. The $5, the letter says, is
to put his name on the memorial.
   ``The names,'' says Scruggs. ``It's got to have all the names.''
   A couple of years later, fellow Vietnam veteran and attorney Bob
Doubek (Scott Paulin) walks into a Pentagon office and tells a
records clerk he needs some information on casualties from the
Vietnam War. Fine, the clerk says. Which ones? ``All of them,''
Doubek says.
   The 58,156 names inscribed on the wall set the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial apart from other monuments, and the names made it
non-political. It is as much anti-war statement as a tribute.
   Scruggs was able to see that need for a symbol that would draw
the nation together. As he says in the movie, ``This is not a
monument. It's a memorial.''
   The movie, directed by Michael Pressman and written by Lionel
Chetwynd, depicts the process that forced Scruggs to break with
some of his fellow veterans and allow a non-military panel to
select an appropriate design. The result was the stark wall
envisioned by 21-year-old student Maya Ying Lin, selected from
1,421 proposals.
   Influential backers of the memorial, including H. Ross Perot,
would not acquiesce until the Memorial Fund agreed to add a
traditional statue of three battle-weary GIs. It is a powerful work
on its own and stands on a rise in front of the memorial.
   ``To Heal a Nation'' is Scruggs' story. A former Army ``grunt,''
he enlisted former officers with fancy law degrees to cut through
the red tape and political resistance that confronted his vision.
But it was Scruggs' determination that got the memorial built _ in
record time, and there on the Mall by the Lincoln Memorial, not off
in some out-of-the-way spot by the side of a highway that the
government tried to steer him to.
   Since Scruggs is the center of the drama, Roberts' performance
is the centerpiece of the movie, and he infuses Scruggs with an
enthusiasm that transcends a sometimes plodding tale.
   Glynnis O'Connor plays Scruggs' wife, Becky, who at first thinks
he should just forget the war and get on with his life, but comes
to realize that he can never get on with his future until this
project reconciles him with his past. Marshall Colt plays John
Wheeler, the lawyer who heads up the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund.
   Sen. Charles ``Mac'' Mathias, R-Md., is played by Laurence
Luckinbill as a thoughtful, effective lawmaker who understands not
just the veterans' need for the memorial, but the nation's as well.

<TEXT>
   Jay Tarses, who has lost a string of critically
praised comedies to the network programmer's axe, says he'll
probably quit TV if his last remaining show, ``The Days and Nights
of Molly Dodd,'' is canned by NBC.
   ``Molly'' moves tonight to a new time period, on Wednesdays, in
a last-ditch effort to avoid cancellation.
   Tarses had learned only recently that ABC had canceled his other
show, ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story.'' Earlier, NBC announced a fall
schedule with no mention of ``Molly Dodd,'' leaving faint hope it
will return after this six-week run is over.
   ABC's decision didn't particularly surprise Tarses, who wasn't
happy with the way ``Slap'' was going. But, he said, ```Molly'
shocks me. I can't deal with it. Whenever I think about it, it just
puzzles me so much, I just don't get it. We keep passing whatever
tests there are, and it doesn't seem to matter to Mr. T.''
   Mr. T is Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment. He
maintains that ``Molly Dodd,'' is ``an interesting show'' but not
necessarily a ``commercial'' show.
   Tarses says that since NBC has become the No. 1 network, ratings
are more important than anything else.
   ``They have `No. 1' parties over there,'' he joked. ``They put
on their devil outfits and dance around a bonfire and throw people
with college educations into a pit or something.''
   ``Molly'' made its debut in the spring of 1987 and got high
ratings. But it was off the air for a year before NBC could find a
new time period for it. It went back in March in the hit-laden
Thursday-night lineup, but Tartikoff yanked it after a few weeks
because it didn't rank in the top 10, only the top 13. ``Night
Court,'' the show it replaced temporarily, had ranked in the top 10.
   In a news conference last week after announcing the fall
schedule, Tartikoff held out some slight hope for the show.
   ``Wednesday night at 9 o'clock, if it were to deliver the same
kind of shares that it was getting on Thursday night, dropping some
10 and 12 points off of `Cheers,' that would be a hit for us,''
said Tartikoff.
   ``If it gets a 25 share off of 37 on Thursday night, that is
what I consider viewer rejection of the show ... and giving up too
many rating points on a night when we could dominate by simply
putting `Night Court' back there.''
   ``Molly'' will lead into ``Cheers'' tonight, but then will be
paired with another half-hour comedy, ``Sara,'' a long-canceled
series that starred Geena Davis and Bronson Pinchot as lawyers.
Both have gone on to other projects.
   Tarses thinks it unlikely ``Molly'' will get the 16.0 rating it
had been getting on Thursday nights after it moves to Wednesday,
where the previous show in the time period, the hour-long ``Highway
to Heaven,'' was getting much lower ratings.
   The rating is a percentage of 88.6 million U.S. homes with
televisions, and it largely determines how much the network can
charge for a commercial.
   ``He (Tartikoff) seems to be so concerned with statistics and so
concerned with being No. 1 and pulverizing the opposition, he may
be disregarding some barometers that are very clear,'' said Tarses.
``That there are shows of quality that do have an audience, maybe
not a 35-share audience, but a bunch of people who are being
deprived of some television shows because of numbers that I don't
believe are really true.''
   Tartikoff last week held out slim hope for ``Molly'': ``If there
is that loyal core that will follow this show almost anywhere, if
they show up anywhere close to the numbers it had on Thursday
night, this could be, God forbid for Jay Tarses, he might actually
have a commercial show on his hands. I don't know what he'd do with
it.''
   Tarses has had a run of heartbreaks, such as ``Open All Night''
and ``Buffalo Bill,'' which heco-created with Tom Patchett. Now
``Slap'' is gone, and ``Molly'' may be, too.
   ``I don't want to go through this any more,'' Tarses said. ``I
did good work. `Molly' and `Slap' were good shows. We've spent a
lot of time, a lot of care, and the result is that in the end you
have rejection, and I've been there before with shows that were
good, too. I don't know how many times I have to go through it.
There are other things I could do in this business.''

   The West European allies are looking to
next week's superpower summit in Moscow with little hope of an arms
control breakthrough _ and with little apparent fear of a breakdown.
   The Europeans want the meeting to spur further improvement in
U.S.-Soviet relations, but they seemingly would be satisified if it
simply avoided any slippage in the momentum toward broader arms
control.
   ``For the Europeans in this case, specific agreements are less
important than atmospherics,'' said Ivo Dalder, a nuclear arms
specialist at the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies.
   The U.S. allies say they are only mildly disappointed that no
deal on deep cuts in long-range nuclear arms will be struck during
the Sunday-Thursday summit between President Reagan and Soviet
Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.
   They're pleased that both sides have pledged to continue
bargaining after the meeting.
   ``It's not the date that's important but the political will to
continue on the path'' started at the 1986 U.S.-Soviet summit in
Iceland, where outlines of a deal on strategic, or long-range,
missiles were worked out, said Jacques Poos, the foreign minister
of Luxembourg.
   Of more concern to the European allies is the timing of Senate
ratification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF,
treaty eliminating the superpowers' intermediate-range missiles.
The accord was signed at last December's superpower summit in
Washington.
   The U.S. missiles to be eliminated under the INF treaty are
based in Western Europe.
   The Europeans see Reagan's fourth meeting with Gorbachev as a
chance to inject new momentum into the process of improving
East-West relations, particularly as it applies to the allies'
links with their neighbors in communist Eastern Europe.
   A chief European concern is how Gorbachev's efforts to open up
parts of Soviet society and restructure the economy will influence
developments in Eastern Europe, according to government officials,
private defense specialists, NATO diplomats and military planners
interviewed recently.
   This concern has been heightened by the recent wave of labor
unrest in Poland triggered by the communist government's latest
economic reforms.
   ``We don't want to base the whole East-West relationship on arms
control,'' said Peter Corterier, the West German secretary-general
of the North Atlantic Assembly, a NATO support group in Brussels.
   Some European leaders, including British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher have said they hope Reagan uses the Moscow meeting to
express Western support for the social and economic changes
Gorbachev is trying to make.
   The Europeans say they are not worried by the recent slowdown in
U.S.-Soviet negotiations on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
which would cut the number of intercontinental nuclear missiles by
half.
   ``You can easily swallow the fact that the START treaty is not
there,'' said Ton Frinking, a member of the Dutch Parliament and
president of the North Atlantic Assembly. ``That's a pity, but it's
a technical rather than a political problem _ we hope.''
   Although none of the superpowers' long-range nuclear weapons is
based in Western Europe they do pose a direct threat to the
Continent.
   West German Gen. Hans-Henning Sandrart, NATO's senior commander
in central Europe, said recently that even if the superpowers scrap
all their medium-range nuclear arms as planned, the Soviets will
remain capable of striking European territory with such long-range
forces as submarine-launched cruise missiles and mobile, land-based
SS-24 and SS-25 missiles.
   ``There is still a strategic threat to the depths of Western
Europe,'' he said.
   A U.S.-Soviet agreement to cut long-range nuclear weapons by 50
percent would not eliminate this threat to NATO territory, but it
would give the Soviets much less flexibility in targeting Europe,
Sandrart said.
   Having lost hope for a START deal at the Moscow summit, some
Europeans appear at least mildly concerned about a possible setback
in the negotiations, which have been hung up on a variety of
technical issues as well as Soviet objections to Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative to develop a space-based defense against
ballistic missiles.
   ``It's very important that the two superpowers, if they are not
actually in agreement, at least agree not to work one against the
other,'' Poos said.
   The Europeans apparently are not fearful that Reagan will pull
off an unwelcome surprise in his arms control discussions with
Gorbachev.
   France and some other allies are still grumbling about Reagan's
October 1986 meeting with Gorbachev in which he discussed a global
elimination of ballistic missiles _ an idea that had not been
studied by NATO and which the Europeans later called dangerous to
Western security.
   ``He must have learned some lessons from his previous summits,''
said Frinking, the Dutch parliamentarian.
   Others said their concerns about Reagan's performance had been
diminished by evidence that the president appears to understand
more about Soviet desires and intentions than when he first met
Gorbachev in 1985.
   ``He has a more sophisticated view of what's going on in the

   The two most commonly used words in business
advertising probably are quality and service. In practice they
might be among the most neglected.
   This dichotomy still shows in surveys of American corporate
practices, even though the consequences are well understood by
management and labor, having caused them serious problems in the
past.
   Further evidence comes in an analysis of 105 responses to a
survey of Fortune 500 companies by Organizational Dynamics Inc., a
management consulting and training company based in Burlington,
Mass.
   The survey found executives are virtually unanimous in their
belief that responsibility for quality must be shared by everyone
in the company. Almost all agreed that ``everyone in the company
affects customer satisfaction.''
   The questioning continued, leading to this finding:
   In the typical company surveyed, just 25 percent of workers were
involved in quality improvement activities. Only 17 percent of the
respondents said their company involves more than half its
employees.
   The results underscore what many quality improvement specialists
have been saying for years, that one of the major quality defects
of American industry is the failure to follow through on corporate
goals.
   The problem isn't one of recognition. Almost every executive
will explain that quality and service are foremost among corporate
goals. Awareness probably has never been higher. The consequences
of poor quality are known.
   In fact, the current emphasis on quality arises directly from
the painful experience American industry had with poor quality
during the 1960s, when U.S. companies began losing entire markets
to the Japanese, who embraced quality.
   Oddly, much of the quality control practiced by the Japanese
emerged from the U.S. experience, and from Americans who had raised
it to the level of a science, including W. Edwards Deming and
Armand V. Feigenbaum.
   Oddly, some major American corporations intentionally let
quality to deteriorate, contending it was more cost-effective to
allow flawed products to leave the factory, to be fixed later by
service departments.
   It didn't work, largely because after-sale service was likewise
flawed. That is, the quality of service was as bad as the quality
of the product, and customers quickly became aware of it. Why not?
They sensed they were being exploited.
   Much of the subsequent recovery of U.S. industry, now showing up
as a resurgence of manufacturing, productivity gains, improved
trade statistics and healthier profits, is a consequence of efforts
to improve quality and service.
   But survey after survey shows that the notion of quality and
service is more deeply imbedded than the practice. Everyone cheers
for improvements, but not nearly as many go to work after the
cheering stops.
   In the Organizational Dynamics survey, respondents agreed that
quality and service control are matters that involve employees at
all levels, but only one-third said they shared customer
satisfaction data with all employees.
   As one of the foremost authorities on quality control, Philip B.
Crosby, has stated often _ he even wrote a book about it _
``quality is free.''
   It may not cost even a penny to begin with, he says, but if it
costs anything at all the cost comes back many times in higher
sales.
   Underlying his assumption is faith in human beings to do
superior work if given the direction and the motivation, and if
given a return on their efforts to contribute.

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a cloudy, midweek afternoon, car
after car slows to a crawl as the occupants crane their necks to
catch a glimpse of this resort town's most famous landmark _ the
vacation retreat of George Bush.
   No matter that the vice president wasn't home or that the
oceanfront dwelling was virtually obscured by fog.
   The drive-bys and gawkers on Ocean Avenue are bound to multiply
this summer as tourists ignore the no-parking signs and pull to the
side of the narrow two-lane road to snap photographs of the home of
the prospective Republican nominee for president.
   Less than two miles away, ``help wanted'' signs festoon the
stores in and around Dock Square as Kennebunkport awakens from its
off-season slumber to begin what may be remembered as its last
summer of relative obscurity.
   By next year at this time, the southern Maine town might occupy
a niche in history as the favored retreat of a sitting president,
joining the ranks of such far-flung places as Plains, Ga., San
Clemente, Calif., and Hyannis, Mass., that were transformed into
news datelines recognized worldwide.
   Already, townspeople are pondering what a Bush victory in
November would mean to this town of 4,500, whose population
balloons to more than 25,000 in the summer.
   ``That's what we're asking ourselves mostly _ what if? And
sometimes the answers that come out are pretty scary,'' said Police
Chief John A. Prescott, whose concerns focus on the flow of traffic
past the vice president's compound at Walker's Point, named for
Bush's maternal grandfather.
   More than 18,000 cars a day spill into Dock Square in the middle
of the summer, according to the state's latest traffic count. ``So
if you figure half those cars went down Ocean Avenue, that's 9,000
cars. And if even 10 percent of those cars stop and park where they
shouldn't, that really fouls things up,'' the chief said.
   To ease potential traffic tie-ups, Prescott recently proposed
that Ocean Avenue be made one-way, but town selectmen scuttled the
suggestion after a public hearing last month.
   The chief also expresses concern about the likelihood of larger
and more frequent protest demonstrations outside the Bush home _
there have been only a handful during his tenure as vice president
_ and the prospect of television vans blocking traffic when he's in
town.
   Bush's election would surely increase the size of the press
corps that follows him to Kennebunkport, making it harder than ever
to get a hotel room at the height of the season.
   A subject of perennial speculation is whether local lobster
fishermen would still be allowed to tend their traps within
shouting distance of Bush's property while he is in town.
   Some have suggested that security would actually diminish if the
Secret Service declared the waters off-limits; lobstermen who
frequent the cove know each other and are traditionally wary of
strangers who wander into territory they regard as their own.
   Residents, town officials and merchants appear proud and
protective of Bush, characterizing him as a good friend and
neighbor whose family's roots here date back to the turn of the
century.
   By all accounts, he keeps a low profile and tries to cause no
disruption by his presence. Townspeople, in turn, respect his
privacy and avoid attempts at commercial exploitation.
   Bush generally spends three weeks each summer in Kennebunkport,
playing golf and tennis and fishing for mackerel or bluefish from
his speedboat docked in the Kennebunk River. He patronizes local
stores and restaurants, attends nearby churches and occasionally
participates in community activities; last year he delivered the
speech at the high school commencement, and in years past he has
appeared in Dock Square for the town's Memorial Day parade.
   Townspeople question whether a Bush victory in November could
generate bigger midsummer crowds than the ones that already swarm
through the downtown area, past the clothing boutiques, art
galleries, upscale restaurants and souvenir shops.
   ``In summertime we're very near gridlock anyway, and how much
more effect it can have is questionable,'' said Roland F. Drew,
chairman of the board of selectmen and a longtime friend of the
vice president.
   ``The place is a zoo in the summertime anyway,'' agreed Howard
Noyes, proprietor of a sandwich shop and gift store known as The
Old Salt's Pantry.
   Kennebunkport, home of such stately old hotels as the Colony and
the Shawmut Inn, has attracted well-heeled tourists from Boston and
New York since the late 1800s while maintaining a dual identity as
a fishing port.
   In the past 15 years, however, the biggest growth has been
tourism, with commercial development fanning out from Dock Square
while real estate values have skyrocketed virtually everywhere.
   Tourists won't find George Bush T-shirts, key chains or other
novelty items for sale in his home town. A cursory stroll through
the business district turned up just one article with his name on
it _ a picture postcard of the Walker's Point home.
   But there are no other Bush-related items amid the racks of
Kennebunkport sweatshirts and shelves of lobster and seagull
mementos that line Nathan Shmalo's store.
   ``People don't want to do anything tacky to hurt him or his
candidacy. We don't want to turn him into a gimmick or a
sideshow,'' Shmalo said.
   Although townspeople take pride in Bush's achievements,
selectman Drew doubts Kennebunkport would ever erect a road sign or
billboard to trumpet his presence.
   ``Lord no! I think he'd be furious,'' Drew said. ``I would hope
we'd never do anything like that. We're not that kind of town.''

<HEAD>Over Three Decades, Developer Leaves Mark on America's Skyline</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By STEWART TAGGART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Where straight lines dominated, he built angles.
Where there was box-like conformity, he brought character.
   In a more than three-decade career, real estate developer Gerald
D. Hines has created some of the most dynamic members of America's
skyline: boldly stylish buildings that are urban landmarks.
   In Houston, his developments include the darkly angular Pennzoil
Place, the neo-Gothic RepublicBank Center and the art-deco Transco
Tower _ all of which helped define the character of their corporate
tenants as well as the city.
   ``People don't want blandness,'' said Hines, who gauges success
partly by how well a building is accepted by the public.
   ``It goes on the front of the telephone book, or it becomes a
(city) classic, since all the taxi drivers know the good
buildings,'' said Hines. ``If you are appealing only to a thin
veneer of the art community, I'm not so sure that is very
acceptable.''
   Since leaving the air conditioning business in 1957 and
undertaking his first renovation of a Houston home to a small
office building, Hines _ through his sole proprietorship Gerald D.
Hines Interests _ has built an estimated 365 buildings in 34 cities
with a combined value of about $4.5 billion.
   Using noted architects like Philip Johnson and I.M. Pei, Hines
works to create developments fitting a geographic individualism he
calls the ``culture'' of a city.
   ``I don't think we have a style _ our style is no style,'' Hines
said. ``Our buildings are so different from year to year, city to
city.''
   And unlike some other developers, Hines has taken a maverick's
approach to financing, often issuing large equity positions in his
projects to investors rather than assuming large amounts of debt.
   He also seeks to lock up leasing commitments for projects before
they are built, rather than building more speculatively with few or
no firm commitments.
   Known for his attention to detail, Hines may evaluate prices
paid for steel, or help select the kind of doorknobs and hinges,
tasks often delegated by others.
   ``That's pretty far down,'' said Houston architect Nolan Willis,
who has participated in some of Hines' projects. ``Others would not
go down into that detail.''
   For Hines, detail is paramount to success.
   ``The culmination of a project is a summation of the detail,''
Hines said. ``If you don't look at the detail, then the rest of it
won't be put together well.''
   The Transco Tower project, for example, called for a large
amount of pink granite to be used as part of the building's lobby.
Although the natural choice was Texas pink granite, which could be
acquired close to Houston, Hines found he could buy similar stone
from Spain, have it fabricated in Italy and shipped to Houston for
about 25 percent less.
   Hines is also known for building expensive scale models of
proposed buildings, using them in well-orchestrated presentations
to potential clients, rather than relying upon artists' drawings
and complicated blueprints.
   ``People are used to seeing things in three dimensions,'' Hines
said. ``We have to provide some means of showing and communicating,
and that's very difficult.''
   Some of the models have cost up to $50,000. A scale model of the
64-story Transco Tower in Houston's Galleria area (the tallest U.S.
skyscraper outside a downtown area) found a second life as a
decoration for the waiting area of Hines' Houston offices, located
in the building.
   According to Hines, architecturally striking structures can be
built for as little as 3 percent to 5 percent more than
conventional skyscrapers, allowing rents to remain competitive.
   ``The conception, the financial conception, those are very
creative parts of our business,'' Hines said. ``How you bring
together tenants and architecture to minimize risk, those are very
exciting.''
   Hines says his buildings also hold their value better in soft
markets than less imaginative styles, and can confer a public
relations windfall for their main occupants.
   ``They (the company) get a building that says to the community,
`We're responsible, we want to contribute,''' said Hines.
``Meanwhile, workers get a better work place.''
   Looking east out of a picture window in Hines' office on the
50th floor, one sees downtown Houston rising from the east Texas
flatlands, an engaging melange of form and color largely dominated
by his buildings.
   ``We were fortunate to be in Houston when it was growing; it
isn't growing now,'' said Hines, who has shifted his focus to
projects in Los Angeles, Washington, Atlanta and Boston.
   Hines currently has three projects under way in other cities:
Figueroa at Wilshire, a 50-story office building in Los Angeles;
Norwest Center, a 57-story office building in Minneapolis where the
primary tenant will be Norwest Corp., a financial services firm;
and Five Hundred Boylston in Boston, a 26-story office building.
   For a man whose legacy is in urban design, the trim, 62-year-old
Hines says he derives much of his inspiration far from the madding
crowd.
   ``Some of my best ideas have come in climbing or snow
mountaineering or ski mountaineering, or just in the back
country,'' he said, dismissing with a smile the next question.
   ``I never plan to retire,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   When crack cooks on Irine Tate's street,
the air smells of easy money, simmering violence and the bitter
promise of a long, hot summer.
   Spring rain disperses the acrid odor of drugs boiling, so the
dealers on the corner wait until the sky opens wide before they
turn up the heat. Tate knows that little trick. She knows that
nasty smell.
   ``It burns your eyes, it burns inside your nose and burns your
tongue,'' she said of the caustic stench created by cooking cocaine
and baking soda into the powerful derivative called crack. ``It
goes down your throat and stays there a long time, just burning the
hell out of you.''
   Eighteen months ago, she smelled only the sweet fragrance of
roses around her bungalow. That was before California gang members
lusting after astronomical profits rolled in, cooking their stuff
and clogging her street with non-stop drug traffic.
   The gangs brought crack for sale, fear for free, north to
Anchorage and east to Denver and beyond, invading medium-sized
cities unaccustomed to hard-core Los Angeles-style drug-dealing and
violence.
   Across the West, quiet streets like Tate's have become sales
territories for Los Angeles' two pre-eminent black gangs, the Crips
and the Bloods, ever searching for bigger, better drug markets.
Business is booming and Southern California police are getting
tough, so expansion makes good economic and survival sense.
   The crack that sells for $600 in Southern California might bring
as much as $3,000 along the northern reaches of the Interstate 5
corridor, ample incentive for gang members to hit the highway.
   Word on the street is that Portland is easy pickings, that Reno
is ready and that Seattle is the land of milk and honey. For Crips
and Bloods with money, crack and a certain entrepreneurial spirit,
untouched communities dangle before them like ripe fruit waiting to
be plucked and squeezed dry.
   ``They call it `putting the move' on a city,'' said Portland
Police Sgt. Neil Crannel, who was working patrol in the housing
projects when he first noticed the LA connection in autumn '86. A
year ago, Crannel became the force's gang resources officer and
began keeping track of gang-related crimes. To date, they number
more than 280, including at least 20 gunshot wounds.
   Seattle has recorded at least seven gang-related murders, five
in 1987 and two so far this year. In one recent six-month period,
Sacramento arrested 77 known gang members from Los Angeles; from
1984 to 1986, felony drug-related gang cases soared 2,000 percent.
   In March, police in Reno, Nev., arrested four youths with ties
to Southern California Crips for raping a 13-year-old girl and
stealing $1 from her. One of the accused was the same age as the
victim. Police said the gang members laughed when the charges were
read in court.
   A Los Angeles police consultant came in to tell Reno police what
they were up against. Intelligence gathering is tough, and cities
around the West constantly share information. Los Angeles
authorities provide critical gang education, but it goes only so
far.
   ``When you get out of LA,'' Crannel said, ``all the same rules
don't apply.''
   Crips and Bloods who might have killed each other in turf
battles in Southern California have been known to cooperate in
Portland, Seattle and Anchorage, at least until they've taken over
the local drug trade. Crips and Bloods have shared crack houses in
Portland and street corners in Seattle, police say.
   ``The bottom line is selling the stuff,'' Seattle police Officer
Dan Fordyce said. ``If it means working with one another, they'll
do that. If it means shooting at one another, they'll do that.''
   When it comes time to battle, they pull out heavy-duty weapons,
including Uzis, Soviet-made AK-47s, sawed-off shotguns, pieces that
resemble small Gatling guns and weapons with laser sights.
   Sacramento police have switched to 9mm semi-automatics, another
popular gang choice. ``Our police-issued .38s just were not
standing up to some of the firepower we were running into,'' Sgt.
Bob Burns said.

   The gang members typically wear the latest fashions, carry
beepers on their belts and keep cellular telephones in their shiny
BMWs, Cadillacs and Blazers, the very picture of young urban
professionals.
   Their sophistication can be frightening. Irine Tate befriended
one Crip who showed her a spreadsheet on his five houses, one of
which appeared to rake in $50,000 a day.
   ``How much they got from each house, how much went to where from
his expenses _ he had it all broken right down,'' she said. ``He
was only 20 years old. And he told me, `It's a business.'''
   Once the business takes hold, shutting it down becomes close to
impossible. Police and concerned citizens are all too aware of how
the Los Angeles gang wars have escalated; many have been to see for
themselves. They return to their cities and neighborhoods with a
clear message: act now and act tough.
   ``The gangs can only be as strong and big as the community
allows them to be,'' said Sgt. Steve Hollingsworth, who monitors
gang activity for the Portland school police. ``You need to attack
very quickly in the infant stages. Don't let it fester and develop
roots, or it will cost you much more to deal with later.''
   A team of gang experts from California and Washington state
recently traveled to Alaska to teach law officers there how to
squash its growing gang problem. Anchorage police have identified a
dozen California gang members in their city: some blue-clad Crips
and a Blood dressed in red were conspicuous at the Anchorage
airport.
   ``It's always been real easy money up here,'' Anchorage Police
Investigator Ron Weatherman said of the Alaska drug market. ``They
come in, undercut everybody, and just take over.''
   In Seattle, aggressive local law enforcement in league with
federal authorities prompted California gang members to limit their
activities to three-day junkets, selling their drugs and returning
south rather than setting up more permanent crack houses. Of the
city's seven gang killings, five defendants either have pleaded or
been charged, and federal charges can mean no bail and stiff
sentences.
   Seattle's strategy: ``We stay in their face,'' said police Lt.
Gerald Adams of the intelligence section.
   ``We're trying to show them that Seattle is not a hospitable
place to come and deal drugs,'' said Capt. John Pirak, who heads
two gang-oriented units. ``If they come to Seattle and are
apprehended, they're going to go to jail.''
   Sacramento, which first recognized its LA gang connection three
years ago, has adopted a similar stance, using ``redlight
abatement'' laws to force landlords to shut down crack houses or
risk having their property padlocked by police for a year.
   Last year, the California capital spent $1.6 million on
narcotics enforcement, including more than $400,000 in overtime.
The effort has paid off: arrests were up 13.2 percent.
   ``When these people first started coming up here, we interviewed
a Los Angeles gang member,'' Burns said. ``He said the word on the
street in LA was that Sacramento was a good market, a little river
village, and they could come up here and just about do what they
wanted.
   ``A few months ago, we arrested a guy from Los Angeles. ... He
said the word on the street in LA is don't get popped in
Sacramento, because they'll slam-dunk you.''
   Portland, suffering from too little jail space, cannot say the
same. Unlike Sacramento, Denver, Phoenix, Seattle and Las Vegas,
Oregon's largest city has no gang squad and no room to lock up gang
members. Most are cited and go on their way.
   ``We've arrested various ones, and they're out the next day or
the same evening,'' Crannel said. ``The whole system seems to be
screwed up right now.''
   On the city's hard-hit, racially mixed inner northeast side,
residents estimate there are at least 300 crack houses. Police are
stretched painfully thin.
   ``It takes at least five different people calling fr any house
to move up on the priority list,'' said Sharon McCormack, who
chairs a 55-member youth gangs task force. ``In some blocks, you
don't have five people who will do that. In some blocks, you don't
have five phones.''
   Portland residents worry about what's in store this summer. When
authorities crank up the heat in Southern California, people 1,000
miles away and beyond feel it.
   ``Everybody's talking about that,'' McCormack said. ``If Los
Angeles is successful, what does that mean as far as spillover for
Portland? Seattle has a stronger police presence, and we're caught
in the middle.
   ``In this community, a lot of people are saying it's going to be
one hot summer.''

<TEXT>
   At 2 in the morning one day three
years ago, Barbara McFalls marched up to the door of a crack house
and demanded her daughter.
   If McFalls thought she'd left gangs and drugs behind when she
moved from East Los Angeles 14 years before, the horrible truth
came home that night. The daughter, now a successful career woman,
never returned to that scene, but the mother did _ picketing crack
houses, lecturing gang members and trying to save the children of
people who didn't care enough to do it themselves.
   ``We've got the LA connection, and it's bad,'' said McFalls, who
lives in the Meadowview neighborhood on Sacramento's south side.
   ``For Sale'' signs line her street, but McFalls has no intention
of running. Instead, she breaks up fights, corrals gang members to
help register voters and urges witnesses to gang violence to
testify. She persuaded two gang members wanted for crimes to
surrender, driving one to juvenile hall herself, and baked sweet
potato pies at the request of another who was being shipped to the
California Youth Authority.
   ``I get out there face to face with them. That's the only way
you can deal with them. And they respect you for it, too,'' said
McFalls, who walks amid the Bloods' red and the Crips' blue with
her own colors, the red and yellow of the Meadowview Improvement
Committee.
   ``You just can't be scared. You have to leave your fear tucked
away somewhere. If you let them know you don't like what's going on
in your neighborhood, they'll move.''
   Some 550 miles north on Interstate 5, Irine Tate never stops
letting them know how she feels. One day last winter, she painted
``NO DRUG PARKING'' in white block letters down the middle of her
Portland, Ore., street, on all four corners, along her retaining
wall and on her neighbor's garage door.
   ``They said, `We live around here, we pay rent.' I said, `You
don't pay no damn rent around here! So get the hell off my block!'''
   The gang members didn't like the dead-honest, drug-hating Tate,
but they had to respect her. She'd sit on her porch and watch their
comings and goings, listen to their deals and learn all she could.
Then she'd call the police, something her neighbors were afraid to
do.
   Tate and McFalls realize the risks they take in opposing the
lucrative drug trade. McFalls has a ``panic box'' in her home: push
the button and police surround her block within two minutes.
   Tate owns a bullet-proof vest. One day a gang member told her it
wouldn't do any good. ``We've got armor-piercing bullets,'' he
said. ``If we want you bad enough, we'll get you.''
   So far, the gangs haven't wanted to hurt either woman, both of
whom temper fear with faith. ``If God wants you to die, then you
die,'' Tate said. ``If God wants me to die with them shooting me,
then I'm going to die with them shooting me.''
   One Crip tried to buy her silence for $10,000, but she wasn't
selling.
   ``I could have paid my bills off and been sitting pretty if I'd
taken that money,'' she said over the drone of a TV soap opera.
``And whose life would I have ruined?
   ``I'd lose my own self-respect. I'd lose my dignity, my pride in
myself. And what would the kids think of me?''
   The kids see all, hear all. They know who's cooking, who's
selling and how much they're asking. Kids as young as 6 have become
lookouts and shills who steer crack customers to one gang's house
and away from a rival's.
   The answer, say McFalls and Ed Elmore, another member of the
Meadowview Improvement Committee, is to give kids guidance and
alternatives. Give them jobs in the summer and places to go besides
the streets. Put back into the community the money and hope that
crack dealers take out.
   A year ago, McFalls' street was crowded with gang members
dealing crack as openly as if they were selling T-shirts or
hamburgers. Now they've retreated indoors, paying rent to single
mothers and old people willing to turn their homes into crack
houses.
   Four California gang members moved in with one of Tate's
neighbors, and the young mother now smokes crack and wonders how to
get rid of her roommates. McFalls gets phone calls in the wee hours
from a woman who became an addict, gave birth to a one-pound baby
and now hears disembodied voices as she aimlessly rides buses
around the West.
   ``Don't you realize what you're doing to your own people?'' an
infuriated Tate once asked a gang member. ``You're ruining their
minds so they don't know how to think. You're killing them.''
   The Crip sat thinking for a long time. ``I guess you're right,''
he told her later. ``But I may as well be making the money as
somebody else.''

<HEAD>Nuclear Testing, Fisheries, Space Among Issues on Summit Agenda</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With no chance of an agreement on strategic arms,
American officials are focusing on other issues they hope will make
President Reagan's trip to Moscow more than just a travelogue.
   When the Moscow summit _ the fourth between Reagan and Soviet
Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev _ was set late
last year, both sides were optimistic they could sign a treaty
reducing long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   But the negotiations are far from complete, snagged on
verification and the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, among other
things.
   Among the other issues to be discussed during the Moscow summit:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NUCLEAR TESTING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reagan and Gorbachev are expected to sign two protocols in
Moscow dealing with underground nuclear explosions. Both are
designed to improve monitoring procedures.
   A U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in 1974 limits underground blasts,
the only nuclear explosions still legal, to 150 kilotons. At the
summit, the two leaders are likely to set the ground rules for
joint experiments in Nevada and in Semipalatinsk in July and August
to measure the force of detonations.
   The Americans prefer a system known as Cortex, which involves
inserting a cable in a shaft about 30 feet from the test and taking
measurements from it, while the Soviets like the seismic system
used for earthquakes.
   Both systems will be used at the U.S. and Soviet tests.
   A 1976 treaty set the same 150-kiloton ceiling for so-called
peaceful blasts. These are nuclear explosions to change the courses
of rivers, or for other non-military purposes. The United States
wants to be able to monitor blasts above the 50-kiloton level.
   Neither side now engages in such testing.
   Still, Reagan has said if verification measures to guard against
cheating are improved he would submit the unratified treaties to
the Senate for approval.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Top U.S. officials say the summit will give both sides an
opportunity to ``review where we are'' regarding conventional
weapons in Europe, but a bilateral accord is unlikely because of
on-going negotiations in Vienna between the countries of the Warsaw
Pact and NATO alliance. There have been hints that Gorbachev might
unilaterally withdraw 50,000 to 100,000 troops from Eastern Europe
to gain a public relations advantage in the negotiations.
   Moscow has conceded for the first time that it has an advantage
over the West in some military categories. The Pentagon estimates
the Soviets have 230 divisions in Eastern Europe compared to 121
for NATO.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHEMICAL WEAPONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Like conventional arms, the issue of chemical weapons is the
subject of multilateral treaty negotiations under way in Geneva.
Hence, the United States is reluctant to sign anything, although
the issue will be raised.
   The Soviets have been pressing the United States to endorse a
sweeping ban on lethal chemical weapons, but U.S. officials say
that push is politically motivated. What the United States wants is
a ``truly global chemical weapons agreement'' that can be verified,
Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway said.
   The Soviets have agreed to join the verification process, but
they haven't filed the necessary plans to safeguard against
cheating. U.S. officials estimate the Soviets have 300,000 tons of
chemical weapons, about six times the U.S. amount.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REGIONAL CONFLICTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The future of Afghanistan will be raised even though the Soviets
have agreed to withdraw from the country under a U.N. agreement
signed this spring. Specifically at issue is the fate of 5 million
refugees living in Pakistan and Iran.
   The top regional issue, however, is Angola where U.S. and Soviet
officials have been trying to arrange a withdrawal of 40,000 Cuban
troops from the country. Withdrawal would have to be accompanied by
implementation of U.S. resolution 435, calling for an end to the
South African occupation of Namibia.
   Otherwise, the United States wants the Soviets to stop selling
weapons to Iran in the Gulf War and to pressure Vietnam to remove
its troops from Cambodia.
   On the Mideast, the Soviets want a full-blown international
peace conference to reach a settlement, while the United States
favors a mostly ceremonial conference that would lead to bilateral
talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CULTURE, EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The two sides hope to arrive at a three-year agreement on
educational and cultural exchanges, extending the accord signed at
Geneva in November 1985. The exchanges, monitored by the U.S.
Information Agency, have mushroomed as Americans and Soviets seek
to learn more about each other through visits and study. But the
exchanges are still lopsided with many more Americans visiting the
Soviet Union than vice versa. Under the agreements, high school and
college students have traveled abroad, and entertainers from both
countries have toured.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HUMAN RIGHTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reagan can be expected to broach the human rights issue,
particularly the plight of thousands of Soviet Jews who have been
prohibited from emigrating. Meantime, both sides are moving toward
an agreement that would allow American psychiatrists to visit
Soviet mental hospitals to determine if dissidents are being
imprisoned in the hospitals. The Soviets would carry out reciprocal
visits to U.S. mental hospitals.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SCIENCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators have drawn up _ but may not sign _ a draft agreement
that calls for annual U.S.-Soviet meetings to promote freer
scientific data exchanges. It includes regulations to protect
scientific ideas, and gives the United States possible access to
Soviet research fields such as nuclear fusion, mathematical theory
and metallurgy.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SPACE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The United States has agreed to help a Soviet unmanned probe of
the planet Mars in 1994, but the two sides are far from signing an
agreement for a joint mission. The Reagan team, however, is
prepared to propose the exchange of studies of future space
projects.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FISHERIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Americans are excited about the possibility of a fisheries
agreement at the summit. At its heart would be the U.S. right to
fish in the Soviet economic zone, 200 miles from shore. Of
particular interest to the United States is the Bering Sea. Soviet
vessels already have access to the U.S. 200-mile zone. The
comprehensive agreement would also cover conservation and
environmental protections.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COAST GUARD</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard and the Soviet maritime are exploring
cooperation on search and rescue operations and exchanging
transporation technologies.

<TEXT>
   Recent reports of growing inventories and
weaker-than-expected demand continue to depress oil futures prices.
   In Monday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts
for July delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.
crude oil, closed at $17.35 per 42-gallon barrel, down 35 cents
from Friday.
   Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded
gasoline settled at 51.44 cents a gallon, down 0.92 cent, while
wholesale heating oil closed at 46.91 cents a gallon, down 0.80
cent.
   Jayne Ball, an analyst at the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
securities firm, said prices fell because ``OPEC's production is
still up there, while there's some speculation that demand is not
as good as a lot of people thought,'' she said.
   She cited a Wall Street Journal article in Monday's editions
that quoted a European consulting firm as putting OPEC's production
at 200,000 barrels a day above projected demand for its crude in
the second half of this year.
   The report came on top of other recent indications that domestic
inventories have risen, contrary to previous expectations, putting
a damper on prices.
   Accordingly, Monday's futures trading was dull, as traders
continued to await the ministerial meeting of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, due to begin on June
8.
   OPEC officials are expected to try again to find a way to limit
their production in order to support prices.

<HEAD>Fed: Stress Eases On Farm Banks; Bankers Have Ample Funds For
Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers stepped up loan repayments in
early 1988 while loan demand remained weak, leaving Midwest farm
banks flush with cash, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reports.
   The new report released Monday is the latest confirmation of
reduced financial stress among banks that survived the severe farm
recession of the mid-1980s.
   A survey of 525 bankers in the Chicago Fed's five-state district
said 46 percent of those questioned reported farm loan repayment
rates in the first quarter exceeded the pace of a year earlier, and
only 2 percent reported slower repayments.
   In addition, the percentage of district banks with undesirably
high ratios of loans to deposits has dropped to 4 percent as of the
first quarter of this year. That's down from 58 percent in the
first quarter of 1979 _ a period of soaring land values and
double-digit inflation when bankers were almost stumbling over one
another to make farm loans.
   ``With faster paydowns on existing farm loans and sluggish new
loan demand, agricultural bankers continue to have ample funds for
lending and relatively low loan-to-deposit ratios,'' said Chicago
Fed economist Gary Benjamin. ``About 42 percent of the bankers
reported that the availability of funds for farm loans in the first
quarter exceeded the year-earlier level while less than 5 percent
reported a decline.''
   An index of loan demand in the Chicago Fed's district, based on
the bankers' responses to the survey, remained weak in the first
quarter, but still was the highest in nearly three years, Benjamin
reported.
   ``The weakness has reflected several factors, including large
government farm program payments, curtailed crop plantings and,
until recently, declines in farm production expenses and cuts in
capital expenditures,'' Benjamin said. ``Although still weak, there
is some evidence that loan demand is starting to strengthen.''
   In the first quarter, for example, 28 percent of the bankers
noted that loan demand was up and 26 percent reported a decline.
Looking at the current quarter, however, 29 percent said they
expected farm lending to be up from a year earlier, while just 19
percent said they expected a decline.
   Benjamin cited several emerging trends for the expected growth
in farm lending.
   ``Crop acreage, after declining in recent years, is likely to
hold steady in 1988,'' he said. ``Government payments to farmers
are trending down. And farm sector cash production expenses, after
declining 15 percent over the last three years, may edge up in 1988
due to higher input prices.''
   Benjamin also reported that ``the stress in farm loan portfolios
at banks has abated considerably.''
   Bad farm loans that commercial banks nationwide charged off
against earnings last year plunged about 55 percent to $530
million, compared with about $1.2 billion in 1986, $1.3 billion in
1985 and $900 million in 1984, when such information first became
available as the farm crisis was deepening.
   Within the Chicago Fed's district _ which includes Iowa,
Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan _ banks' net charge-offs
for farm loans fell last year to about $110 million from $350
million in 1986, nearly $400 million in 1985 and about $200 million
in 1984, Benjamin said in his report on credit conditions.
   Benjamin said estimates of outstanding farm debt nationwide were
between $141 billion and $143 billion at the end of last year, down
from $155 billion in 1986. That's more than 25 percent below the
peak of almost $193 billion in 1983.
   Benjamin also says preliminary estimates based on reports by
lenders indicate that banks moved ahead of the troubled Farm Credit
System last year to become the leading lender serving farmers.
Nationwide, banks held nearly $40.7 billion of outstanding farm
debt at the end of last year, compared with the approximately $39.4
billion held by institutions within the Farm Credit System.

<HEAD>U.S. Computer Company Announces Joint Venture With Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With only 50,000 personal computers in
the Soviet Union, a deal for that country to buy thousands of
U.S.-designed systems could signal a coming boom for other
companies in California's Silicon Valley.
   ``The potential business could be enormous, not only with this
particular agreement, but for other companies that have computer
products needed by the Soviets,'' provided trade doors between the
two countries stay open, said Cliff Lindsey of Dataquest Inc., a
market research firm in San Jose, Calif.
   Advanced Transducer Devices of Sunnyvale announced Monday it had
reached an agreement with the Soviet Union to assemble and sell
thousands of U.S.-designed personal computers in the U.S.S.R.
   ``The Soviets are coming to the West now to find a whole range
of products for the civilian side of their economy,'' said Michael
O'Rourke, Advanced Transducer's vice president of international
sales.
   With a population of more than 300 million, the Soviet Union
only has about 50,000 personal computers, Advanced Transducer
estimates. The United States, with a population of around 250
million, has 30 million PCs.
   The joint venture between Advanced Transducer and V@O
Electronorgtechnica, a Soviet electronics trading company, is
believed to be the first involving computers, Advanced Transducer
said.
   Advanced Transducer, which makes components for personal
computers, said the joint venture expects to sell at least 4,000
PCs to the Soviets in the first year. The computers would be for
use in Soviet schools, factories and offices, and not the military,
O'Rourke said.
   Soviet officials say their school system alone needs 100,000
personal computers a year, Advanced Transducer said.
   Under the five-year agreement, which must be approved by both
the U.S. and Soviet governments, Advanced Transducer and V@O
Electronorgtechnica, or Elorg, will form a joint venture called
Elorgsoft International. Elorgsoft International will operate as a
government-sanctioned corporation in the Soviet Union.
   Advanced Transducer, a subsidiary of Televideo Systems Inc.,
will begin the joint venture by assembling IBM-compatible PCs in
Sunnyvale. Later on, they will be assembled and sold in the Soviet
Union.
   The company expects to have the first 20 personal computers in
the Soviet Union by late June and hopes the joint venture can begin
assembling the units in that country by the end of the year.
   Elorg and Advanced Transducer reached the agreement about a week
ago after several months of talks, O'Rourke said. A ribbon-cutting
ceremony is planned in Moscow next month to officially announce the
agreement and the opening of a service, training and distribution
center for the joint venture there.
   Talks began last October when American Trading Corp., a New
York-based Soviet import-export company affiliated with Elorg,
approached Advanced Transducer with a proposal for a joint venture,
O'Rourke said.

<HEAD>AB Electrolux Raises Bid for Murray Ohio After Judge Clears Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL RAWLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AB Electrolux of Sweden, freed by a
federal judge to pursue a takeover of Murray Ohio Manufacturing
Co., moved immediately to raise its bid from $182 million to $197
million.
   AB Electrolux, a giant appliance maker, said Monday it was
boosting its offer for Murray Ohio by $4, to $52 a share. Murray
Ohio manufactures lawn mowers and bicycles at a plant in
Lawrenceburg, Tenn.
   Murray Ohio stock closed at $51.125 a share Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange, more than double its price last Dec. 31.
   In a letter to Murray Ohio's directors, who turned down the
earlier $182 million offer, AB Electrolux President Anders Scharp
wrote from Stockholm, ``We are not `hostile outsiders.' We are as
familiar as our major brand names, Frigidaire, Tappan and Eureka in
American homes, and Poulan and Weed-Eater in American back yards.''
   AB Electrolux, which has no connection with U.S. vacuum cleaner
manufacturer Electrolux Inc. of Marietta, Ga., operates a Tappan
kitchen range plant at Springfield, Tenn., north of Nashville.
   Scharp said AB Electrolux had no intention to move Murray Ohio's
production from Lawrenceburg, ``nor would it make any economic
sense for Murray's production to be consolidated or transferred to
our other facilities.'' The letter was made public in New York.
   Nonetheless, Murray Ohio officials mustered their 3,000
employees at a night meeting in Lawrenceburg to discuss the court
ruling.
   After the meeting, John L. Duncan, president and chief executive
officer of Murray Ohio, said he did not know details of AB
Electrolux's increased bid.
   ``We understand that they're going to make an offer and we'll
deal with that when it comes,'' Duncan said.
   Murray Ohio's lawyers said they would appeal the decision by
U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Wiseman. Notice was filed to appeal
Wiseman's dissolution of a temporary injunction against AB
Electrolux to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court in Cincinnati.
   The Murray Ohio employees and others among the 11,000 residents
of Lawrenceburg have formed a ``Just Say Nej'' committee to oppose
the takeover. ``Nej'' is Swedish for ``No.''
   Wiseman ruled after last week's hearing on Murray Ohio's request
to block AB Electrolux from proceeding with its bid.
   ``I know of no law permitting the court to enjoin the transfer
of stock. We have in this country respect for private property,''
he said.
   Wiseman said he also found ``absolutely no evidence'' that
confidential information on Murray Ohio was made available to AB
Electrolux by the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, which
once advised Murray Ohio how to defend itself against a takeover.
   ``All the information appeared in an (magazine) article that was
readily available to any professional investigator,'' Wiseman said
in his ruling from the bench.
   In New York, Wiseman's ruling prompted Sullivan & Cromwell's
John L. Warden to issue a statement saying, ``We are gratified that
the court's decision ... on the evidence confirmed the position we
have taken since this matter began.''
   In a statement Monday, AB Electrolux said its tender offer would
be financed from its working capital and would be subject to
shareholder approval ``only if AB Electrolux is not satisfied that
the Ohio Control Share Act is inapplicable to the offer.''
   The Ohio Control Share Act is an anti-takeover law, and the AB
Electrolux statement said it would seek a ruling from federal
courts in Ohio that the act is inapplicable.
   Murray Ohio began in Ohio in 1919 manufacturing running boards
for automobiles. When running boards disappeared, the company
switched to wheeled toys, moving its headquarters to Brentwood,
Tenn., and opening its Lawrenceburg plant in 1955.

<HEAD>Maxxam Group to Acquire KaiserTech for $725 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   KaiserTech Ltd., the fifth-largest
aluminum producer in the world, will be acquired by Maxxam Group
Inc. for around $725 million.
   KaiserTech announced Monday that it had agreed to be acquired by
the Los Angeles-based real estate and lumber company in a merger
that would pay shareholders $19.375 in cash for each share of
KaiserTech common stock.
   The agreement, under which KaiserTech would become a subsidiary
of Maxxam, was approved by KaiserTech's board of directors at a
special meeting Sunday.
   KaiserTech stock closed 25 cents lower Monday at $17.875 a
share. Maxxam stock closed unchanged at $13.875.
   Industry analysts predicted that KaiserTech, which has lost
money in recent years, should do well in 1988. The Oakland-based
company, which is the parent of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp.,
is the third-largest aluminum producer in the nation.
   ``KaiserTech made money in the first quarter, and we're looking
for the first time in the last five or six years the company's
going to make money from its operations,'' said Sean St. Clair, an
analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   St. Clair also noted that aluminum prices have risen and that
U.S. producers are selling more both in the United States and
abroad.
   The two companies declined to comment on the future of
KaiserTech's current management and staff. But analyst Thomas Van
Leeuwen of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York said the
company's corporate structure probably would remain intact.
   KaiserTech received one other bid from a private investment
group that proposed a leveraged buyout, but that company was not
identified. In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances the
purchase of the target company with sales of the target's assets or
from its cash flow.
   KaiserTech shareholders will vote on the proposed merger at a
special meeting to be called soon, the company said.
   KaiserTech's lawyers believe that Delaware law, under which
KaiserTech is incorporated, requires an affirmative vote of at
least two-thirds of the shares of common stock not owned by Maxxam
for approval, company spokesman Robert W. Irelan said.
   Earlier this year, Maxxam acquired 32 percent voting control of
KaiserTech's stock from KaiserTech Chairman Alan Clore for about
$224 million, Maxxam spokesman Jim Iaco said.
   Last month, KaiserTech sued Clore and Maxxam over a dispute over
rights to nominate directors. But the two companies have agreed to
ask that the litigation be put on hold, Irelan said.
   Maxxam, which develops real estate, also owns Pacific Lumber
Co., the world's largest producer of redwood lumber. It has
received widespread criticism for speeding up the cutting of
old-growth redwoods in Northern California.
   KaiserTech operates plants in nine states and seven foreign
countries. It reported losses in five of the past six years, mainly
because the recession of the early 1980s depressed aluminum prices,
St. Clair said.
   But the industry began to recover in 1986 when prices, which had
dropped to 48 cents a pound, rose to $1.06 a pound, he said.
   KaiserTech reported a net loss of $362 million last year,
widened from a loss of $39.8 million in 1986. Revenues were about
$2 billion in both years.
   Much of the 1987 loss stemmed from the company's restructuring
last year, Irelan said.
   But in the first quarter of 1988, KaiserTech reported net profit
of $36.3 million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of $528.3
million. For the same period in 1987, KaiserTech posted a net loss
of $31.1 million on revenue of $494.2 million.

<TEXT>
   Japan reported Tuesday its net overseas assets
soared to a record of about $240 billion in 1987, making it the
world's largest creditor nation for the third year in a row.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the figure was up 33.5
percent from 1986, when Japan's external assets totaled a
then-record $180.4 billion.
   He presented an annual report to the Cabinet Tuesday that said
Japan's governmental and private assets abroad at the end of 1987
totaled $1.07 trillion, up 47.3 percent from a year earlier, while
liabilities surged 51.9 percent to $830.8 billion. That left Japan
with net external assets of about $240 billion.
   Japan surpassed Britain and other industrialized nations in
terms of net external assets in 1985, with a total of $129.8
billion.
   A Finance Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday the sharp increase came from active
investment in U.S. and other foreign securities by Japanese
financial institutions and corporate and private investors.
   The external assets also include private and government loans,
trade credits and the diversion of part of Japan's huge trade
surplus, which totaled $76 billion last year, to foreign securities
acquisitions.

   Hong Kong's trade deficit was double in April

<HEAD>Record 1987 Washington Apple Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With more than two months left in their
marketing season, Washington growers reporte record sales of the
nation's largest apple crop.
   Through May 20, Washington growers shipped 56.5 million boxes of
apples, compared with the old record of 55 million boxes for all of
last year, according to the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association.
Each box weighs 42 pounds.
   The shipping figures are good news for an industry trying to
market a record bumper group, but the good news is tempered by
stagnant prices.
   ``We're ahead of where we need to be at this time of year,''
said association manager Bill Dewitt in a telephone interview
Monday.
   There is no sign that sales are slackening.
   In the past five weeks, sales are nearly 40 percent above the
same period in 1987, according to the Washington Apple Commission,
which spent more than $1.6 million in television and radio ads over
the past two months.
   This apple crop, which represents roughly half the nation's
supermarket supply, is easily the largest in state history,
although the estimate has been cut to 67.4 million boxes from an
original projection of 72 million boxes because of the loss of poor
quality fruit during storage, Dewitt said.
   Overseas sales are way up this year, with 11.1 million boxes
shipped to foreign countries through May 20, compared with 5.2
million boxes at that time in 1987, Dewitt said. Most shipments are
to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia,
traditionally good customers.
   Exports are helped by the low prices this year, Dewitt said.
   Prices range from $7 a box for Washington Fancy grade apples to
$10 to $14 a box for Washington Extra Fancy, $2 to $3 lower than
last year, Dewitt said. It can cost about $9.50 to grow, pack and
ship a box of apples, so many of the state's 5,000 growers are
still losing money or breaking even.
   Apples are the state's largest cash crop, worth $489 million to
growers in 1986.

<HEAD>McCormick & Co. Inc. Ends Bid To Acquire West Coast Competitor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCormick & Co. Inc. announced it would end its
proposed $56 million takeover of a West Coast competitor after the
Federal Trade Commission unanimously voted to challenge the bid in
court.
   Monday's announcement effectively ends the Hunt Valley spice
maker's four-month pursuit of regulatory approval for its proposed
acquisition of the Spice Islands line of spices, herbs and vinegars
from Specialty Brands Inc., of San Francisco.
   The announcement came just hours after the FTC said it had
authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction blocking the
sale because of its potential to ``substantially reduce competition
in the production and sales of spices.''
   ``As a result of the FTC's obvious opposition, McCormick &
Specialty Brands have decided not to pursue the merger,'' Mac
Barrett, McCormick spokesman, told The (Baltimore) Sun. ``We're
disappointed.''
   Executives at Specialty Brands did not return phone calls Monday.
   The FTC, which typically reviews how proposed mergers will
affect market share, barriers to entry and competition in a given
industry, has sought to block only seven proposed mergers in the
past year, said spokeswoman Susan Ticknor.
   The takeover would have given McCormick, already the world's
largest spice producer, the brand name of one of its best-known
rivals in the $850 million condiments business.
   McCormick's proposed purchase price of $56 million for the West
Coast concern was a considerable premium over Spice Islands' 1987
sales of $30 million.
   When the proposed deal was announced in late January, some
industry analysts speculated that it might raise antitrust
questions because of McCormick's huge share of the market,
estimated to be more than twice that of Durkee, its largest
domestic competitor.
   The acquisition of Spice Islands, which holds an estimated 30
percent of the fast-growing $100 million gourmet side of the
business, would have given McCormick an 80 percent share of that
segment, industry analysts say.
   ``The FTC is hanging tough on this one because they believe it
would create too much concentration in a hotly contested business.
Everybody's fighting for market share,'' said David S. Leibowitz,
an analyst who follows McCormick for American Securities in New
York.
   Others, however, expressed surprise at the FTC's ardor in
blocking McCormick's acquisition of a company whose 1987 sales
totaled only $30 million.
   ``It's surprising that the commission would attempt to block a
transaction that is relatively small compared with all the
multi-billion dollar deals we've seen lately,'' said Barry Ziegler,
an analyst at Tucker, Anthony & Co. in New York. ``It seems like a
lot of effort over a relatively small matter.''
   Late last month, a federal judge granted the FTC's request to
stop the proposed deal on the grounds that McCormick hadn't
provided enough information for the agency to determine how the
transaction would affect competition in the spice and seasonings
business.
   Prior to that decision, McCormick sued the agency, maintaining
that the company had supplied more than 120,000 pages of documents
and provided the depositions of key executives.
   Earlier this month, McCormick acquiesced to the FTC's demand for
more information and dropped its suit. But Monday, two days before
its deadline to render a decision, on the merger, the FTC said it
would challenge McCormick in court if it persisted with the
transaction.
   Given the length of time that has passed since the proposal
first was announced and the possible legal battle with federal
regulators, McCormick decided to abandon its bid. ``After the
months involved in getting us to this point and the FTC's decision
to oppose the transaction, we decided the best course of action is
to drop the merger,'' Barrett said.

Injures 16</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Industrial fires in Los Angeles and the Houston area forced the
evacuation of thousands of people, including 200 who sought shelter
at Dodger Stadium. And an explosion at a Virginia computer parts
plant injured 16.
   Los Angeles authorities evacuated up to 11,000 people Monday
because they feared a lethal gas might form from cyanide and other
chemicals stored at a plating company destroyed by fire, officials
said. No injuries and no chemical cloud were reported.
   A laboratory fire in South Houston ignited toxic chemicals and
cylinders of compressed gas, injuring 26 people, forcing the
evacuation of 600 and causing nearly $1 million in damage,
officials said. Most injuries were minor.
   Los Angeles firefighters were carefully removing an estimated
26,000 gallons of chemicals today, fearing a building collapse
could form a deadly chemical mixture.
   ``If that happens,'' said fire inspector Ed Reed, ``it can
actually form a gas as lethal as what they use in the gas chamber
at San Quentin.''
   The fire destroyed Builders Hardware Finishers Inc. in a heavily
industrial section northeast of downtown early Monday.
   The cleanup began slowly as fire officials debated who would pay
for the expensive chemical removal operation, Reed said.
   The removal cost was estimated at more than $25,000, he said.
   A 14-square-block area was evacuated after hazardous materials
crews determined the chemicals were unstable, said Fire Department
spokesman Jim Williamson.
   By evening, at least 11,000 people had been moved, said police
Sgt. Mario Mojarro. However, Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo
put the number closer to 3,800.
   Police reopened most of the evacuation area early today but kept
the block surrounding the gutted factory closed, said police
Officer Bruce Nelson. It was not immediately clear how many
returned during the early morning hours.
   The Red Cross set up an evacuation center with overnight
accommodations under the centerfield bleachers at nearby Dodger
Stadium. About 200 people showed up.
   ``I'm not going to be able to sleep, because I haven't seen my
husband, and my husband doesn't know where I am,'' said Maria Cruz,
who was at the stadium with her small son.
   The fire caused an estimated $340,000 in damage to the building,
Williamson said. The cause was under investigation.
   In South Houston, fire officials monitored the charred Caleb
Brett USA Inc. chemical-testing facility today for signs of any
lingering risk to the area from Monday afternoon's fire.
   ``It was a very big problem because we don't know what we're
dealing with,'' said Fire Chief Jim Sybert. ``We don't know what's
contaminated.''
   Twenty-five of the 50 firefighters who fought the blaze were
treated for eye and skin irritation at hospitals, and released,
officials said. A laboratory worker who inhaled fumes was admitted
to Memorial Southeast Hospital for observation, said regional
laboratory manager Russell Leach.
   The chemicals included gasoline, crude oil, caustic soda,
naphtha, acrylonitrile and benzene, Sybert said. There also were
cylinders of nitrogen, argon and helium.
   Gloria Rodriguez was in her home about two blocks from the lab
when the fire began.
   ``I heard a big boom and fire started shooting up, then the
phone lines caught fire and started sparking,'' she said.
   Leach estimated damage at nearly $1 million.
   In Sterling, Va., four people remained hospitalized today from
Monday morning's blast at the Automata Inc. computer parts factory,
which sprayed caustic chemicals throughout the plant, officials
said.
   Two were in critical conditon and two were in serious condition,
Loudon County Fire and Rescue Department Director Bill Goldfeder
said Monday night. The 12 others injured were treated at hospitals
and released, he said.
   The blast spewed a chemical containing sulfuric acid and
hydrochloric acid into the plant.
   ``We had people get doused and drenched with the chemical when
it exploded,'' said Fire Chief Jim Kiser. He said people continued
to breathe chemical fumes as they were being treated.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the latest auction to the highest level since
the October stock market crash.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $6.4 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.34 percent, up
from 6.28 percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.71 percent, up
from 6.50 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since Oct. 19, when three-month bills
sold for 6.84 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.21 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 6.53 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,839.70 and 7.04 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,658.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 7.40 percent last week
from 7.33 percent the previous week.

   Bank of New York Co. said it has no intention of
boosting its $1.1 billion hostile offer for Irving Bank Corp. to
outdo a sweetened bid from Italy's second-largest bank.
   Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA on Monday raised its offer for a
controlling interest in Irving to $80 a share, or about $760
million. Analysts called the increase over the bank's previous bid
of $75 a share significant.
   The state-run Italian bank said the latest bid, which seeks 51
percent of Irving's 18.5 million common shares outstanding, was
conditional on Irving keeping intact the anti-takeover ``poison
pill'' it adopted to fend off Bank of New York.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said his company had no
plans to raise its tender offer of $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of
its own stock for each of Irving's shares.
   Bank of New York had proposed to slightly increase the stock
portion of the $1.1 billion bid if, among other things, Irving
agreed to hold friendly talks and dismantle its poison pill
defense. But Irving's board of directors unanimously rejected that
proposal last week.
   Brady blasted the Banca Commerciale condition for raising its
offer as tilting the playing field. ``This time we know they
reserve the right to walk away whenever they like,'' he said.
   Banca Commerciale said the revised offer would retain a one-time
dividend of $10 a share, which Irving had promised shareholders as
part of a complex restructuring program that includes asset sales
and cost-cutting measures.
   ``As the recent modifications of the size of the offer by our
institution demonstrates, BCI confirms that it is heavily committed
to Irving,'' Banca Commerciale Chairman Enrico Braggiotti said in a
statement from the company's Milan headquarters.
   Analysts said the sweetened offer might be enough to sway
shareholders.
   ``It's another $5 of cash, which individual shareholders tend to
value highly,'' said Virginia Adair, an analyst with Merrill Lynch
& Co.
   A greater test will come when Bank of New York tallies how many
shares were tendered to its offer. Analysts said there could be a
solid legal count a few hours before the tender offer closes at
midnight EDT today.
   ``It's very possible we could have a real decision by then,''
Adair noted.
   Bank of New York must have the support of 67 percent of Irving's
outstanding shares in order to merge with the bank. Irving said
today it has been advised that Bank of New York asked the
government to grant it an additional 45 days to consummate the deal.
   At last count, Bank of New York said it held about 50 percent of
Irving's shares.
   Irving has recommended that shareholders accept Banca
Commerciale's offer. The Italian bank's latest offer comes on the
heels of an announcement by Bank of New York on Friday that it will
challenge Irving's recently adopted poison pill amendment.
   Under the amendment, the defensive provision would become
activated should someone acquire at least 20 percent of Irving
shares on the open market. The poison pill previously would have
gone into effect in the event of a takeover not supported by
management.
   Irving's poison pill had been revised to prevent Bank of New
York from carrying out its threat to buy up Irving shares in the
open market and operate the company as a subsidiary.
   Separately, Irving said in a statement Monday that preliminary
reports that the current Irving board had been re-elected were
correct. The company is expected to release the final vote count at
its reconvened annual meeting today.
   Bank of New York, however, said Monday it would file suit in New
York State Supreme Court today to declare the results invalid. The
company claimed that four Irving shareholders with more than
950,000 shares of Irving stock confirmed that their votes were
improperly counted.
   Bank of New York waged an aggressive proxy battle to take over
Irving's 16-member board.
   In composite trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange,
Irving closed 75 cents higher at $61.87{ a share, while Bank of New
York rose 50 cents to close at $30.62{ a share.

   Stocks rose slightly in early trading today as a
surge of dividend-related trading caused business to heat up from
the previous session, the slowest since last Thanksgiving.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 4.64 points to
1,946.12 in the first 1{ hours of trading.
   Gainers narrowly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 578 issues up, 541 down and
529 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.44 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   In economic news, the Commerce Department said orders to U.S.
factories for ``big ticket'' durable goods rose 0.8 percent in
April, boosted by a jump in orders for military communications
equipment.
   The third consecutive monthly increase, which fell in line with
expectations, followed gains of 0.9 percent in March and 0.1
percent in February. It confirmed most analysts' views that the
economy is growing robustly.
   Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co. leaped 7~ to 59[ after a delay
caused by an overload of buy orders. A federal judge ruled Monday
that Sweden's AB Electrolux could proceed with its bid for Murray,
and Electrolux raised its bid for the company to $52 a share, or
$197 million.
   Utilities dominated the list of most actively traded stocks as
traders sought to capture their dividends. Northeast Utilities was
up [ at 19} and Kansas Power and Light was up \at 24\.
   Among blue-chip stocks, Boeing was up 1 at 52}, Citicorp was up
\ at 22, Texaco was unchanged at 46[ and Eastman Kodak was up \ at
40~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.18 to 142.39. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 0.26 at 290.42.
   On Monday, the volume on the floor of the Big Board came to
102.64 million shares for the full session, the smallest total
since 86.36 million were traded in a post-Thanksgiving session last
Nov. 27.

   The newest White House report on the stock
market collapse does nothing to soothe Wall Street's problems and
is merely an effort to prevent legislative action this year, the
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee said today.
   The chairman, Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., told the four
high-level federal officials who wrote the report that their study
was ``pitiful'' during a hearing on its recommendations.
   ``This working group has been the regulatory equivalent of the
North Carolina Tar Heels basketball strategy called the
four-corners offense,'' Proxmire said. ``Pass the ball around to
run out the clock. Never shoot, just stall and run out the clock.''
   Proxmire has been critical of the study since its release May
16. On Monday, he said on the Senate floor that in the seven months
since Oct. 19 _ the day the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped a
record 508 points _ American corporations have raised only $1.5
billion. During the same period between 1986 and 1987, those
businesses raised $10.7 billion, he said.
   Proxmire said the unpredictable, fluctuating performance of the
stock market since October has scared many investors away and made
it diffcult for companies to raise needed investment money. The
recommendations in the report, which was overseen by the Treasury
Department, did not address that problem, Proxmire said.
   The study was written by Treasury Undersecretary George D.
Gould, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairwoman Wendy Gramm,
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David S. Ruder and
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   The report's recommendations have drawn fire on Capitol Hill
from lawmakers who have complained that it failed to recommend
decisive action to deal with the ills of the nation's financial
markets.
   It contained no proposals to restrict types of program trading,
the computer-driven transactions some critics have blamed for the
market's continued volatility. It ignored critics who say the
margins _ or up-front payments _ for stock index futures
transactions on the Chicago commodities markets are too low and
thus encourage speculation that causes wild bounces in prices on
the market in New York.
   In addition, it paid no notice to a recommendation by an earlier
White House task force that one federal agency _ likely the Fed _
be put in charge of all issues that affect the nation's stock,
futures and options markets. That jurisdiction is now split among
the Fed, CFTC and SEC.
   The Gould group's most striking recommendation was for an
hour-long trading halt across all financial markets if the Dow ever
drops by 250 points in a single day. A second, two-hour closing
would occur if the widely-watched index plummets by 400 points.
   The Dow has dropped as many as 250 points only once _ last Oct.
19. The working group's members say setting the trigger at such a
high point would keep it out of the market's normal workings and
ensure that it comes into play only in emergencies.
   The report also recommended changes in the clearing, credit and
settlement mechanisms that the markets use to complete the
exchanges of money and paperwork that accompany each day's
transactions.

   Fuji Bank Ltd. has agreed to acquire 24.9 percent
of Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., a Chicago-based
primary dealer in U.S. government securities, officials said Monday.
   Fuji will pay Kleinwort Benson's parent, London-based Kleinwort
Benson Lonsdale PLC, $14.5 million for the stake in addition to $25
million for all of the Chicago unit's subordinated debt, the
parties announced Monday.
   The deal, which is subject to Federal Reserve approval, would
give Fuji, the world's third-largest bank, a major foothold in the
U.S. securities market.
   Primary securities dealers trade directly with the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. Such status is valuable because many
institutional investors will place orders only with firms that are
primary dealers.

   Grain and soybean futures opened higher today on
the Chicago Board of Trade as dry-weather concerns returned to the
markets.
   Weekend rains caused the grain markets to sell off Monday. But
with dry conditions returning to the Midwest, prices were expected
to resume their climb, analysts said.
   ``Again, it's all weather-related,'' said Richard Loewy, senior
grain and oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York. ``The meteorologists are basically saying it's going to
be warm and dry the next several days with very little chance of
getting any moisture.''
   In a six-to-10-day forecast issued late Monday, the National
Weather Service called for conditions in the Corn Belt to be warmer
and drier than normal through the first half of next week.
   Also Monday, the Agriculture Department reported soybean
planting was 62 percent complete as of Sunday. Corn planting was 95
percent finished.
   The USDA also reported a slight decline in the condition of
winter wheat crops.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 2} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.45 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 2\ cents higher with July at $2.17\ a bushel; oats were } cent
to 1\ cents higher with July at $1.72 a bushel; soybeans were {
cent lower to 7{ cents higher with July at $7.63 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .43 cent lower with June at 72.22
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent lower to .05 cent higher
with May at 80.95 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .47 cent
lower with June at 53.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.20 cent to .28 cent lower with July at 53.75 cents a pound.
   Cattle and hog futures settled lower on Monday. Frozen pork
bellies were higher.

   When Claire Scholz started making children's
bathtub puppets 10 years ago, she thought in terms of thousands.
Before long, she may be talking millions.
   Although her company remains tiny _ consisting of Ms. Scholz and
two other staffers _ her trademark Tub Buddies are getting
nationwide exposure in newspaper promotions. And her success is
providing production work for two factories in rural South Dakota
and valuable employment opportunities for handicapped workers in
the state.
   ``One nice thing about our stuff is that it can go into rural
areas where unemployment is bad,'' said the puppet maker.
   Ms. Scholz aleady has received the 1988 Governor's Cup for her
contributions to special education in South Dakota.
   ``They can do a lot more things than we allow them to do,'' Ms.
Scholz said of handicapped workers. ``There's a lot they can do
better than people off the street.''
   She stumbled into the business through contacts she made at a
New York product show. ``It is very much an industry of who you
know,'' she said.
   Her Drizzle the Dragon, for instance, is offered as a premium
for buying a brand of toilet bowl cleaner. Consumers who send in
proof-of-purchase seals from the product are eligible to buy
Drizzle at a reduced price.
   Ms. Scholz is also working on deals to feature puppets with
chewing gum, tea, life insurance and spark plugs.
   ``The danger of the premium industry is that it's a one-time
deal,'' she said.
   She said cartoonist Charles Schulz is working on a Snoopy design
to fulfill one company's request. Another firm wants Kermit the
Frog, one of the famous Muppet characters created by Jim Henson.
   On a recent trip to New York, Ms. Scholz toured Henson's
workshop. ``It was South Dakota girl goes to heaven,'' she said.
   Her puppets are good for product premiums because the price is
right, $3.99 to $5.99 retail, and the quality is high, she said.
   ``More and more the awareness is coming back to `Made in the
USA' products,'' she said.
   Ms. Scholz, 38, started manufacturing bathtub puppets in
Deadwood, S.D., in 1978 after spending several years traveling the
country doing street theater with a group called ``Dragons Are Too
Seldom Puppets,'' named after an Ogden Nash poem.
   In 1980, her company, now called ``Dragons Are Too Seldom
Inc.'', sold 20,000 puppets through individual gift and toy stores.
Two years later, she got into mass marketing, and by 1984, she was
selling 300,000 puppets a year, produced by 120 home seamstresses
in the northern Black Hills.
   Half a million Tub Buddies sold last year, and she hopes to
double that figure in 1988. In addition, she produces Rub-A-Dub
Glubs _ soft, fuzzy bath mitts shaped like a pirate ship or Noah's
Ark.
   Two new products, still being developed, are expected this
summer. ``We're kind of getting out of the bathtub,'' she hinted.
   As the company grows, pressures change for Ms. Scholz. When no
bank would lend her money to get started 10 years ago, she
persuaded private investors to take a chance. Later, she obtained a
Small Business Administration loan. Now she owns 93 percent of the
company.
   With success has come other problems. Ms. Scholz recently won a
copyright lawsuit in Boston against a company that made what she
calls ``bad copies'' of Tub Buddies.
   Gone are the home workers, replaced at first by a manufacturing
plant in Missouri, and later by the South Dakota factories
employing handicapped individuals.
   Prairie Trends, a for-profit factory, was set up by the Huron
Area Adjustment Training Center to produce about 200,000 puppets
this year. The 26 people producing the puppets include eight
handicapped workers who handle packaging and shipping.
   ``If we had more entrepreneurs like Claire we would have a lot
more work for our people,'' said Tom Meekins, executive director of
the training center, a private agency.
   In Sturgis, the Black Hills Special Services Cooperative has
been producing Ms. Scholz's creations for three years and will turn
out 450,000 pieces in 1988. The co-op is a public agency that
educates special students from 12 school districts. About 50
percent of the co-op factory's workers are handicapped.
   ``One more factory would be nice,'' Ms. Scholz said, if the
business continues to grow.

<HEAD>Singapore's Booming Economy Squeezed By Labor Shortage</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caught between patriotism and protectionism,
officials are reluctantly allowing sales clerks from other
countries to work behind the counters in Singapore department
stores.
   On the one hand, officials don't want their booming economy to
suffer from a lack of labor. But they are equally determined not to
let the country depend indefinitely on low-skilled foreign workers.
   No quick solution is in sight.
   In announcing the budget recently, Finance Minister Richard Hu
noted that a ``controlled revolving pool of foreign workers on
short-term work permits'' would be allowed to continue beyond 1992.
   ``The demand for foreign workers has been increasing rapidly.
More than half of the 48,000 jobs created in the manufacturing
sector last year were filled by foreign workers. In the last three
months, manufacturing companies have been recruiting about 2,500
foreign workers each month,'' Hu said.
   Bolstered by strong overseas demand and foreign investment, the
economy has bounced back from a recession three years ago. But a
limited labor pool in this city-state of 2.6 million people is now
regarded as a threat to continued growth.
   Help-wanted ads cram the newspapers. Signs offering walk-in
interviews are posted outside dozens of factories. With workers
able to pick and choose, job-hopping is common, especially in the
electronics industry.
   Economic expansion generated a net increase of 66,000 new jobs
last year, according to Ministry of Trade and Industry figures. The
economy grew by 8.8 percent, compared to 1.8 percent in 1986.
Unemployment was 2.8 percent at the end of 1987, against 4.6
percent at the beginning of last year.
   The boom is exemplified by Seagate Technology, the largest
single private employer. The U.S. disk-drive manufacturer started
operations here six years ago with 50 workers and now employs
13,000.
   The United States decided in January that Singapore, known along
with Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea as the fast-growing ``four
dragons'' of Asia, is no longer a developing country in need of
special trade preferences. Duty-free access to the U.S. market for
the exports of all four is to be ended.
   Established department stores complained earlier this year of a
shortage of about 2,000 sales clerks. Newly-opened stores were able
to lure away such personnel from older retailers by offering high
starting salaries. Older merchants could not match the money
because of a wage freeze imposed during the recession. They
appealed for government help.
   Labor Minister Lee Yock Suan told parliament recently that
labor-starved storekeepers could now hire foreigners providing they
had the equivalent of a high school education.
   One chain of eight stores advertised in neighboring Malaysia for
counter staff, so far with indifferent results. The Malaysian
economy is also thriving, absorbing much of the labor Singapore
stores and factories seek, and at least one retailer suggests that
the educational qualification is too stringent.
   Until the stores got help, alien ``work permit holders'' could
be hired only in construction, manufacturing, hotels and as
domestic servants. These jobs are often spurned by increasingly
affluent Singaporeans, who enjoy the highest standard of living in
Asia after the Japanese.
   The government once argued that guest workers in these fields
were manageable because terms of service were clear cut. They were
usually housed in dormitories by their employers and automatically
sent home when contracts ended. It was assumed that retail clerks
would be scattered throughout the island and might try to remain
after their contracts expired.
   The total work force is 1.2 million. About 40 percent of the
estimated 140,000 foreign laborers are employed as domestic help,
three-quarters of the from the Philippines.
   White-collar foreigners, including executives, bankers,
engineers and teachers, are classified separately. Those with
special skills are being avidly sought.
   Lee said the policy on foreign workers was ``already very
liberal'' and would not be eased further. As a small country,
Singapore cannot afford to let the unskilled flow in, Lee said.
   He estimated that for every 1 percent of growth, the economy
needs 10,000 foreign workers. For 10 percent growth, it means
100,000 foreign workers, which could not be allowed, Lee said.
   No more than 50 percent of a company's staff can be from outside
the country. To restrain demand further, the government collects a
special tax from employers of foreign workers.
   Lee suggested that private companies do not try hard enough to
attract available locals, including housewives, those willing to
work part-time and older people.
   There are 745,799 Singaporeans listed as economically inactive,
many of whom left the work force at the traditional retirement age
of 55.
   ``With sufficient inducements and job opportunities, many
housewives could be attracted back to the labor markets. The easy
way out is for employers to lobby for access to more foreign
workers,'' Lee said.
   Of particular concern to trade union leaders is a pool of older
workers who lost relatively well-paid jobs in the recession and who
are unsuited to the openings now available or unwilling to accept
them.
   Meantime, the government acknowledges the labor crunch by
allowing workers to be recruited from China although Singapore has
no diplomatic ties with Beijing and remains rigorously
anti-communist.

<HEAD>Old Ways Carrying Utica Beer Maker Into Its Second Century</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UTICA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Call F.X. Matt II old-fashioned and you're
likely to get a nod of agreement and a thank you.
   That's because old-world methods and a strong association with
tradition are what have helped the third-generation beer maker's
business outlast thousands of other breweries and what Matt expects
will carry his company through its second century.
   ``There are some secrets to success and respect for tradition is
one of them,'' said Matt, whose grandfather, Francis Xavier Matt,
started the company in 1888 as the West End Brewing Company.
``There were some things the founder preached to his son and he to
me.
   ``My grandfather had a brewing philosophy of making beer the
right way, even if it wasn't the most economical way. He felt a
brewer had to keep faith with the public by making a high quality
product. Today, we still believe that,'' said Matt, who, like his
grandfather and father before him, tours the brewery daily.
   The strength of tradition at the F.X. Matt Brewing Company can
be seen in the original turn-of-the-century office design that
reminds employees and visitors alike of the company's 100-year-old
legacy. But that doesn't mean time has stood still at the brewery.
   ``My grandfather was fond of saying, `A business is like a man,
you have to feed him to keep him alive.' We do things the old way,
but we do it with the most advanced equipment,'' said Matt, making
note that the company has spent more than $20 million since
building one of the country's first million-dollar brewhouses in
1948.
   Matt's brewing technique, called krausening, was carried over
from Germany by F.X. Matt, who emigrated to America in 1878 and
went to work with the Bierbauer Brewery the following year.
Krausening is a process in which newly fermented beer is added into
a tank of already aging beer to produce a natural carbonation.
Because the process adds weeks onto the time required for aging
beer, many companies use chemical additives to accomplish the same
thing.
   Before the first Matt turned 30 he had taken over Bierbauer and
reorganized it into the West End brewery. It was the smallest of
Utica's 12 breweries and one of over 4,000 nationwide. Today,
Matt's is the 12th largest of about 30 breweries in the United
States, but only a fraction of the size of industry leader
Anheuser-Busch Inc.
   The company continued to grow during the next three decades but
was nearly ruined in 1919 when the government passed the
prohibition amendment. The brewery survived _ however, tenuously _
by establishing a line of soft drinks, fruit beverages, syrups,
extracts, distilled water and malt-tonic under the label Utica Club.
   When prohibition was repealed in 1933, the West End Brewing Co.
was the first beer maker in the nation to obtain a permit to renew
beer sales _ one and a half hours after President Franklin D.
Roosevelt signed the repeal measure into law.
   In 1951, 91-year-old F.X. Matt turned over the company
presidency to the oldest of his two sons, Walter, who ran the
company until his son ascended to the top executive position in
1980. During Walter's reign, while smaller breweries fell victim to
industry giants, the company's production rose to over 500,000
barrels a year.
   Because the company is privately-owned and for competitive
reasons, current production levels are not released, but Matt's
makes eight different kinds of beers, including two light beers, a
cream ale and a malt liquor.
   But more important than quantity to Matt is the taste of his
product.
   ``The public in this country tends to think of beer as an
open-the-hatch-throw-it-down beverage. I want them to think about
the taste, because if they do, I'll get some of them as
customers,'' said Matt, who laments that most American beer makers
have steered away from producing beers of distinctive character.
   His determination to give beer drinkers a beverage with
``guts,'' as he calls it, led to the company's involvement with
specialty beers, including one that competes head-on with popular
European imports.
   ``I was visiting a friend in Germany and he had taken me for a
ride on the autobahn in his Mercedes-Benz. It was a marvelous
ride,'' recalled Matt. ``I said to myself if I were an American
carmaker I would want to build something this good, a car that was
as good as the best. I realized then that I should do that with my
beer.''
   The result was Saranac 1888 All-Malt Lager, a rich,
highly-hopped Bavarian-style beer that carries a flavor comparable
to any import. Unlike most American beers, Saranac contains no rice
or corn grain, only barley, malt and water.
   The beer has proven popular, so much so that on several
occasions demand has outrun supply. But Matt, like his grandfather
did years ago, tells distributors they must wait while the beer
ages properly.
   ``Our future lies in the hand of the consumer. If they feel our
products are worthwhile, we'll be around for another 100 years,''
he said.

   Stock prices staged a broad-based rally in London
on Tuesday amid renewed takeover speculation.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 21.6
points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 1782.9, slightly below its
highest level of the day.
   Trading volume was a moderate 459.6 million shares, compared
with Monday's 360.6 million shares.
   Wall Street failed to provide the direction for London equities
as in previous sessions and the London market appeared to be
trading on its own momemtum, dealers said.
   ``It's very encouraging to see London take the lead and perhaps
we're seeing the beginning of the decoupling from the U.S.
market,'' said Nicholas Knight, an equities analyst with James
Capel & Co. Ltd.

   Hal Riney & Partners, a San Francisco advertising
agency known for its Bartles and James wine cooler commercials, was
named Tuesday to handle General Motors Corp.'s Saturn Corp.
account, reportedly worth $100 million a year.
   Riney was among three final contenders selected over the past
eight months by Saturn and GM officials, dealers and the United
Auto Workers. The other two finalists were N.W. Ayer of New York
and Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos of Boston.
   Saturn spokesman Dave Barthmuss declined to confirm the widely
reported $100 million estimate of the annual value of the contract
or to put any dollar figure on annual billings.
   ``Hal Riney & Partners is known for its outstanding ability to
deliver endearing emotional executions with high technical quality.
We will work closely together to ... reach Saturn's target
customers with maximum impact,'' said Donald Hudler, Saturn vice
president for sales, service and marketing.
   Saturn is both an independent GM subsidiary and the sixth
car-making division of the world's largest automaker. It was
created to develop new production, worker and dealer systems and to
produce an inexpensive U.S.-made small car that can compete with
Japanese models.
   Saturn, which has headquarters in Troy and is completing a
manufacturing complex in Spring Hill, Tenn., is to introduce its
first car in the fall of 1990 as a 1991 model.
   Barthmuss said the agency will begin work immediately.
   Saturn's advertising agency was required to agree to a
commissions arrangement that makes part of its receipts dependent
on Saturn's sales and earnings, Saturn spokeswoman Nannette Wiatr
said.
   Riney's clients include Alamo Rent-A-Car, Security Pacific Bank,
Perrier, Campbell Soup Co. and Gallo wine.
   Perhaps its best-known ads are the down-home Bartles and James
wine cooler spots featuring Frank Bartles and his partner Ed James,
who end each piece with: ``Thank you for your support.''

   Chips and Technologies Inc., a key source of
chips for personal computer clones, said Tuesday it has reached an
understanding with IBM that it does not need a license from the
computer giant for its current business.
   International Business Machines Corp. indicated it will focus on
requiring licenses of companies that actually make the personal
computer clones, said Gordon Campbell, the chairman and chief
executive of Chips and Technologies.
   The San Jose, Calif.-based company said IBM has assured it that
if a license is required in the future, one will be available on
IBM's normal terms and conditions.
   Chips and Technologies recently announced a set of chips
designed for computers compatible with IBM's new Personal System-2
line of personal computers.

<HEAD>Cablevision To Buy Wometco Cable, Exec Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cablevision Industries, one of the largest cable
television companies in the country, said it will buy Miami-based
Wometco Cable TV in a tax-free exchange of common stock in a deal
valued at $725 million, Wometco's president said Tuesday.
   Wometco is a privately owned cable television company with
subscribers in North and South Carolina, West Virginia, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and Georgia.
   Its controlling stockholders are affiliated with the Robert M.
Bass Group, Inc., of Fort Worth, Texas.
   Cablevision will acquire 311,000 subscribers, according to
Wometco President Milton Lewis.
   Cablevision, based in Liberty, N.Y., will also assume Wometco's
debt and its preferred stock, currently estimated at more than $700
million, Lewis said.
   Alan Gerry, chairman and chief executive officer of Cablevision
Industries, said the transaction will take place on Dec. 1, 1988,
providing Cablevision with a total of more than 900,000 subscribers.
   Before the exchange of stock is completed, Wometco will give to
its present stockholders a Wometco subsidiary which operates cable
television systems for about 140,000 subscribers in the Atlanta,
Ga. suburbs.
   Wometco was acquired by the Bass Group and the Taft Broadcasting
Company from Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. in December 1986 for
about $620 million. The Bass Group bought the 50 percent of the
cable operation that Taft had owned in October 1987.

   Stocks rose today as a surge of dividend-related
trading caused business to heat up from the previous session, which
was the slowest since last Thanksgiving.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 12.60 points to
1,954.08 with two hours of trading to go.
   Gainers outnumbered losers about 3 to 2 in the overall tally of

April, boosted by a jump in orders for military communications
equipment.
   The third consecutive monthly increase, which fell in line with
expectations, followed gains of 0.9 percent in March and 0.1
percent in February. It confirmed most analysts' views that the
economy is growing robustly.
   Business remained slow aside from dividend-related trading.
   ``Most of the institutions seem to be totally paralyzed,'' said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for First Albany Corp. in
Albany, N.Y.
   Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co. leaped 7} to 59. A federal judge

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some soybean futures closed up the
30-cents-a-bushel daily limit Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade
and grain futures also advanced sharply on renewed concern about
dry weather.
   Monday's sharp price declines were only a temporary setback and
the weekend rains that caused them only a brief respite from the
unusually warm, dry conditions that will continue to dominate
springtime weather in the Midwest, according to Tuesday's forecasts.
   ``The meteorologists lowered their forecasts of rain between now
and next Monday and everybody jumped back on the bandwagon,'' said
Jerry Gidel, an analyst in Chicago with G.H. Miller & Co.
   The National Weather Service, in a six-to-10-day outlook issued
late Monday, called for warmer and drier than nomal conditions in
the Corn Belt through the first half of next week.
   Also Monday, the Agriculture Department reported soybean
planting was 62 percent complete as of Sunday. Corn planting was 95
percent finished.
   The soybean market is especially sensitive to weather factors
amid dwindling stockpiles and fears of tight supplies.
   At the close, wheat was 4} cents to 18 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.47{ a bushel; corn was 4 cents
to 5\ cents higher with July at $2.19{ a bushel; oats were 4 cents
to 4\ cents higher with July at $1.75 a bushel; soybeans were 11{
cents to 30 cents higher with July at $7.82 a bushel.

<HEAD>Court Finds Mediagenic Infringed On Philips Patent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has upheld a finding of
patent infringement involving video games sold by Mediagenic Inc.,
the former Activision Inc.
   North American Philips Corp., the patent licensee, announced
Tuesday the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington
had found the patent valid and infringed by all 11 of Mediagenic's
video game cartridges involved in the litigation.
   Mediagenic will petition the appellate court for a rehearing and
if denied will consider an appeal to the Supreme Court, Bruce
Davis, chief executive of the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company,
said in an interview.
   The patent, which dates to the 1960s, was licensed exclusively
to North American Philips by Sanders Associates, North American
Philips said.
   Other video game companies that have signed patent licenses with
North American Philips include Mattel Inc. and Atari Corp., said
Joseph Briody, the company's corporate patent counsel. He said the
company is suing Nintendo of America Inc. and expects that suit to
go to trial in October.
   Briody said North American Philips has generally sought paid-up
licenses rather than payment of damages from the video game makers.
He said the appellate court's decision was May 9.
   North American Philips, a subsidiary of the Dutch electronics
giant NV Philips, sells products under labels such as Magnavox,
Norelco, Philips and Sylvania.

   Stocks rebounded modestly today as the volume of
trading picked up because of a surge of dividend-related trading.
   Business remained slow aside from trading by investors seeking
to capture the dividends of utilities in quick turnovers.
   Institutional investors that ordinarily account for a large
share of the trading were standing aside because of continued
concerns about high interest rates.
   ``Most of the institutions seem to be totally paralyzed,'' said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for First Albany Corp. in

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Prices Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most major currencies
Tuesday in thin, uneventful trading.
   Gold prices finished slightly lower in most markets. Republic
National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold of $459.20 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, compared with Monday's late bid of
$460.30.
   A lack of market-affecting news kept the dollar trading in a
narrow range. The only significant move came when the dollar broke
through the 124-level against the Japanese yen.
   But unsubstantiated rumors that the Federal Reserve stepped in
to support the currency helped push the dollar back up again, said
Stephen Flanagan, an assistant vice president at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co.
   Traders also noted an international meeting of chief foreign
exchange dealers and managers in Hawaii this week may also be
having a dampening effect on activity.
   ``It possibly is leaving some junior dealers manning the boards,
and they may or may not have instructions to get too involved,''
said Ron Sapiro, head trader at Continental Illinois National Bank
& Trust Co. in Chicago.
   The dollar closed lower earlier in Europe, where dealers said
business was very quiet.
   ``Nobody knows what to do,'' said one dealer at an American bank
in London. ``The big money is just sitting in cash deposits. People

But in New York it cost $1.86725 to buy one pound, less expensive
than Monday's $1.86875.
   Britain's top Treasury official, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson, reiterated Tuesday Britain should ensure it
maintained a stable pound while keeping the brakes on inflation.

   Stock prices rebounded Tuesday, but the volume
of trading remained light as wary investors refused to commit their
money.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.05 to 1,962.53,
or slightly more than 1 percent. Other market measures showed
smaller gains.
   Pessimism about interest rates continued to weigh on the market,
sapping investors' willingness to jump in.
   ``The most important thing a market needs is volume. With a lack
of volume you're not going to see any sustained rallies,'' said
Philip Puccio, manager of institutional trading for Dillon, Read &
Co.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
905 issues up, 549 down and 498 unchanged.
   The volume of trading on the floor of the NYSE came to 139.93
million shares. That was up from 102.64 million shares in the
previous session, the lightest since the day after Thanksgiving
last year.
   However, two utilities with attractive dividends accounted for
more than 28 million of the shares traded _ 23.8 million for
Northeast Utilities and 4.6 million for Kansas Power & Light.
Investors, mainly Japanese, buy the stocks to capture their
quarterly dividends, then quickly sell them back.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 163.13 million shares.
   The stock market's rebound seemed unconnected to any major news.
   The Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose 0.8
percent in April, which was roughly in line with expectations.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita and Federal Reserve
Governor Wayne Angell were quoted separately as saying they felt
the dollar was at stable levels against major foreign currencies.
   ``If there's anything noticeable it's how quiet it is, how
motionless the markets are,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer for First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   Other than utilities, Boeing was the most actively traded stock
on the Big Board, rising 2[ to 53~. There has been speculation that
the company is close to getting an order for about 60 planes of the
757 class from United Airlines.
   Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co. leaped 8 to 59\. A federal judge
ruled Monday that Sweden's AB Electrolux could proceed with its bid
for Murray, and Electrolux raised its bid for the company to $52 a
share, or $197 million.
   On the American Stock Exchange, BDM International rose 3} to
34]. Ford Aerospace Corp. said today it was buying the defense
contractor for $34.75 a share, or about $425 million.
   Among NYSE blue chips, Citicorp rose } to 22{, Texaco fell \ to
45~, American Telephone & Telegraph was up [ to 26{, General
Electric climbed { to 40[ and International Business Machines rose
{ to 109\.
   The market value of all U.S. stocks rose $21.2 billion, or 0.85
percent from Monday, according to the Wilshire Associates 5,000
Equity Index, which measures NYSE, American and over-the-counter
issues.
   The NYSE index rose 1.32 to 143.53.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 2.75 points to
293.49, and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 2.68 to 253.51.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.16
to 290.52. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed with a gain of 1.90 to 365.16.

<HEAD>Soybeans Resume Rally, Post Near-Limit Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The soybean futures market shook off the dampening effects of
last weekend's rains and resumed its dry-weather rally Tuesday,
with prices on some contracts advancing nearly the
30-cents-a-bushel daily limit.
   Grain futures also gained on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   On other markets, copper futures prices fell sharply while
precious metals were mixed; cocoa futures soared; livestock and
meat were mostly lower; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   Monday's steep drop in soybean futures prices was only a
temporary setback and the weekend rains that caused it were only a
brief respite from the unusally warm, dry conditions that will
continue to dominate springtime weather in the Midwest, according
to Tuesday's forecasts.
   ``The meteorologists lowered their forecasts of rain between now
and next Monday and everybody jumped back on the bandwagon,'' said
Jerry Gidel, an analyst in Chicago with G.H. Miller & Co.
   The soybean market is especially sensitive to weather factors
amid dwindling stockpiles and fears of tight supplies if this
year's crop does poorly.
   In addition weather-related speculative buying, the soybean
complex got a boost from India's purchase of 20,000 metric tons of
U.S. soybean oil and hedge-type buying of soybean meal futures by
commercial grain processors, Gidel said.
   The grains basically followed the soybeans, but corn also
benefitted from a government report of increased export demand and
wheat was buoyed by an Agriculture Department report of dry-weather
damage to the winter wheat crop.
   Wheat settled 4} cents to 18 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.47{ a bushel; corn was 4\ cents to 5\ cents
higher with July at $2.19\ a bushel; oats were 3} cents to 4{ cents
higher with July at $1.75 a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents to 29{
cents higher with July at $7.83{ a bushel.
   Copper futures prices sank on the Commodity Exchange in New York
in response to steady increases in London Metal Exchange stocks of
the metal, analysts said.
   Tight supplies have been the main feature of the copper market
for more than a year, and the recent gain of more 12,000 tons on
the London exchange indicates supplies of deliverable copper are
growing, said John O'Connell, metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New
York.
   ``The LME is now at 58,000 tons. That's a big jump,'' he said.
   Copper settled 2.2 cents to 4.1 cents lower with May at 98 cents
a pound.
   Gold futures settled slightly lower while silver advanced a bit
on the Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 10 cents to $1.70 lower with June at $461.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.5 cents to 1.6 cents higher with May at $6.754
a troy ounce.
   Cocoa futures soared to 3{-month highs on New York's Coffee,
Sugar & Cocoa Exchange.
   Analysts cited strong technical factors and rumors that the
Brazilian cocoa crop would be poorer than expected.
   Cocoa settled $35 to $40 higher with July at $1,710 per ton.
   Most cattle futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
on bearish technical factors and expectations of falling cash
prices due to slack demand for beef, analysts said.
   ``Retailers have been very lackluster in terms of buying volume
to fill their needs for the post-Memorial Day period, and it seems
like packers are also trying to buy cattle for a little less,''
said Charles Richardson, an analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock &
Co.
   Hog futures were mixed while frozen pork bellies retreated in
reaction to a weaker tone in the cash market, Richardson said.
   Live cattle settled .40 cent lower to .05 cent higher with June
at 72.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .80 cent lower to .10
cent higher with May at 81 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent lower
to .20 cent higher with June at 53.40 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .25 cent to .40 cent lower with July at 53.70 cents a
pound.
   Oil futures prices closed mixed in light trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange ahead of the afternoon release of the American
Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory figures.
   The report showed a buildup of both gasoline and crude oil
stocks and a drop in supplies of distillates, which include heating
oil.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 5
cents higher with July at $17.40 a barrel; heating oil was .20 cent
to .40 cent higher with June at 47.31 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .20 cent to .41 cent higher with June at 51.85 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures posted substantial gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 3.65 points higher at 254.25.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is reviewing claims by
Reuters Information Service Inc. that American Telephone &
Telegraph Co.'s plans for a joint venture with Telerate Inc. would
violate an antitrust court order.
   Reuters says the venture to offer a foreign exchange
transactional service would violate the consent decree that broke
up the Bell system, which prohibits AT&T from entering the
electronic-publishing business until August 1989 at the earliest.
   ``There is no question that the transactional service
contemplated by the joint venture constitutes `electronic
publishing'' within the meaning of the consent decree, said a
letter Reuters sent to the Justice Department's antitrust division.
A copy of the letter was obtained by The Associated Press.
   Reuters' parent company, Reuters Holdings PLC, operates an
electronic foreign-exchange service similar to the ventured planned
by AT&T and Telerate. Reuters' service allows traders to confer
electronically using computers, said Reuters spokesman Robert Cooke.
   Cooke said he could not comment on the letter.
   A Justice Department spokesman confirmed the letter dated May 10
was received, but antitrust attorney Nancy Garrison declined to
comment. The antitrust division enforces the consent decree.
   AT&T spokeswoman Mary Ward said the company is ``in complete
compliance'' with the consent decree.
   John Jessop, executive vice president of Telerate, said the two
companies plan to develop a service that allows foreign exchange
traders to trade electronically with each other, ``and that's not
getting into the information business.''
   ``We're getting on with our business and we think Reuters should
do the same,'' Jessop said. ``We're a little surprised that a
company with a dominant market position in transactional services
should seek government help in fending off competition.''
   Telerate, 56 percent owned by Dow Jones & Co., operates a global
financial information network.
   AT&T is the nation's largest long-distance company.

<HEAD>Texaco and Takeover Strategist Maneuver For More Negotiating Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. and its largest shareholder gave
themselves the option of three extra days to negotiate Tuesday as
part of an effort to reach a truce in their feud over the troubled
oil giant's future.
   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of
Texaco's stock, has threatened a shareholder fight to elect his
associates to the board at the company's annual meeting next month.
   Icahn has stated previously that Texaco, the nation's No. 3 oil
company is worth more to shareholders broken up and sold. The
management has pledged to sell at least $5 billion worth of assets
as part of a profound restructuring plan. The two sides have been
intensely negotiating for the past few weeks.
   Texaco said late Tuesday that to help further discussions, it
and Icahn had agreed to a mechanism under which the annual meeting
could be postponed from June 7 to June 17. Both sides had
previously agreed to postpone the meeting to June 14 if necessary
so the new arrangement gave them three additional days.
   A receptionist at Icahn's New York office said he was out of the
office and unreachable for comment.
   Sources familiar with the Texaco-Icahn negotiations, who spoke
on the condition they not be identified, said the option to further
delay the annual meeting did not necessarily mean there was any
significant movement in the position of either side. There had been
speculation an agreement was near.
   ``It signifies that each side would like to stop the clock from
ticking and have three free days without the encumbrance of time,''
said one source.
   Texaco shares, which have been falling since the truce talks
began, declined $1.50 Tuesday to $46.12{ in heavy volume in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   The Icahn negotiations are the latest chapter in Texaco's effort
to function normally following a protracted legal battle with
Pennzoil Co., which left Texaco mired in bankruptcy court for
nearly a year.

   Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday it is splitting its
Electrical and Electronics Division into two separate divisions,
one for automotive electronics and one for electrical and
fuel-handling systems.
   ``The application of electronics in Ford cars and trucks is
expected to grow significantly in importance in the next few
years,'' said O.B. Marx III, Ford's Diversified Products Operations
director for automotive components.
   ``At the same time we have major programs under way in
electrical and fuel-handling operations. So we chose to separate
the electro-mechanical functions from electronics products,'' Marx
said.
   Frank E. Macher, general manager of the Electrical and
Electronics Division, becomes general manager of the new
Electronics Division. Robert J. Womac, director of corporate
strategy for the old division, becomes general manager of the
Electrical and Fuel Handling Division, Ford said.
   The 14,800-worker Electronics Division handles all electronics
technology and products including powertrain controls, audio
systems, instruments and electronically controlled equipment such
as anti-lock brakes.
   The 6,084-worker Electrical and Fuel Handling Division is
responsible for equipment such as alternators, starters, fuel
pumps, small motors and ignition products.
   The Electronics division has plants in Pennsylvania, Mexico,
Ontario, Great Britain and Brazil. The Electrical and Fuel Handling
Division has Michigan plants in Rawsonville and Ypsilanti and a
plant in Bedford, Ind.

   The Santa Fe Railroad had one of its best
four-month periods in recent history from January through April,
earning more than double what it made in the same period of 1987,
company officials said Tuesday.
   That made the railroad the star performer of Santa Fe Southern
Pacific Corp., a Chicago-based holding company, officials said at
the corporation's annual shareholders' meeting here.
   Improvements in the railroad's income resulted from a 22 percent
increase in carloads and increased efficiency, officials said.
   Overall, Santa Fe Southern had net income of $395.8 million, or
$2.52 per share, compared with $71 million, or 45 cents per share,
for the same period last year.
   The latest period's results included a $335.9 million gain from
the sale of assets. It also included a $35 million charge from the
company's restructuring program.
   Earnings from continuing operations were flat at $59.9 million,
or 38 cents per share, compared with $60.6 million, or 38 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   The company did not announce revenue figures.
   Also Tuesday, the company's board of directors elected Robert D.
Krebs to replace the retiring John S. Reed as chairman. Krebs also
will continue serving as president and chief executive officer.
   Officials told shareholders the sale of assets during the first
four months helped erase some of the debt Santa Fe incurred from a
one-time special dividend of $30 per share paid to shareholders
earlier this year.
   At Tuesday's sometimes contentious meeting, several shareholders
were critical of the special dividend, saying they would take a
large tax loss this year because of the way it was structured.
   Shareholders also voted to recommend overturning a ``poison
pill'' anti-takeover defense instituted by the corporation's
management. However, Krebs said both he and Reed, who remains on
the board of directors, would vote against following shareholders'
advice.
   The poison pill would be triggered if any shareholder's stake
exceeds 20 percent. If that happened, other Santa Fe shareholders
would be permitted to buy new stock at half price.
   Two major shareholders, Olympia & York and Henley Group Inc.,
have criticized the pill in the past. Both companies have attempted
to take over Santa Fe Southern during the past year.
   Krebs pointed out that those companies represented a majority of
the shareholders who voted against the pill Tuesday.
   Richard Foley, a Santa Fe employee and shareholder from Tucson,
Ariz., who supported the proposal to overturn the pill, said, ``The
measure passed today requires that Santa Fe management make a
decision to listen to the shareholders, or refuse to allow their
shareholders a voice in ownership.''
   Foley also criticized the board of directors' decision to sell
the Southern Pacific Transportation Co. to the Denver-based Rio
Grande Industries Inc.
   Meanwhile, at a news conference after the meeting, John Swartz,
president of the railroad, said the company's restructuring is
ahead of schedule.
   Under the restructuring announced in June 1987, Santa Fe
Railroad reduced its divisions from 11 to six, with one of the new
and enlarged divisions headquartered in Kansas City, Kan., and the
other in Newton, Kan.

   Production of a four-door compact sedan
originally planned to begin next year at the new Diamond Star
Motors plant in Normal will begin instead this summer in Japan, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The Bloomington Pantagraph said Mitsubishi Motors Corp. will
start building the sedans in Japan and marketing them in the United
States, a year before the Diamond Star facility is scheduled to
make them.
   Diamond Star begins production this September of a two-door,
front-wheel-drive sports coupe at its new $650 million plant. The
company is a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi.
   G. Glenn Gardner, chairman of Diamond Star, said his plant may
produce only the sports coupe if demand is high enough. If Diamond
Star begins building sedans, as planned, Mitsubishi will continue
to produce them in Japan as well.
   ``The plant here has its hands full launching the sports car,''
Gardner said Monday. ``We wanted to concentrate on that.''
   The sports car will be sold at prices starting at less than
$10,000.
   Chrysler will market the vehicle as the Plymouth Laser.
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, which has 205 dealerships in the
United States, also will distribute the car but has not announced
its name.
   Eventually, the 2 million-square-foot assembly plant will
produce 240,000 cars annually and employ 2,900 workers.
   The sedan will replace the Mitsubishi Mirage and the Chrysler
Colt models. Mitsubishi will market the sedan as the Mirage while
the Chrysler version will be marketed by its Jeep-Eagle division as
the Summit.
   Gardner said it will be priced in the $8,000 to $9,000 range.

<HEAD>Ford Aerospace Buying BDM International for $425 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Aerospace Corp. said Tuesday it is buying
BDM International Inc., a defense services company, for about $425
million.
   In buying BDM, Ford Aerospace will get access to expertise used
by government defense, security and intelligence agencies, said
Eliot Benson, vice president and research director at Ferris and
Co. Inc. in Washington, D.C.
   BDM, based in McLean, Va., has participated in projects
including mobile basing for intercontinental missiles and the
application of space-oriented strategic defense technology _
President Reagan's Star Wars program.
   BDM, in turn, will benefit from Ford Aerospace's deep cash
pockets in competing for government contracts, which account for
more than 90 percent of BDM's revenue, Benson said.
   ``It's getting harder for companies to make money in the defense
business. There is severe competition for a pie that's not
growing,'' he said. After years of increased defense spending,
``we're seeing constraints ... making it more difficult for these
defense companies to grow and leading to more acquisitions.''
   Ford Aerospace, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.,
will pay $34.75 apiece for all Class A and Class B common shares of
BDM.
   BDM was founded in 1959 by Drs. Joseph V. Braddock, Bernard J.
Dunn and Daniel F. McDonald.
   The three founders have granted Ford Aerospace an irrevocable
option to purchase their Class B shares, representing 80.7 percent
of the voting power of all BDM stock.
   The agreement ``virtually assures that Ford will be able to
complete the acquisition,'' said James Hughes, BDM's general
counsel.
   Ford Aerospace will begin a tender offer for all BDM common
shares by May 31, the company said.
   ``This transaction is part of Ford Aerospace's strategy to
solidify its base and expand its business in the command, control,
communications and intelligence field,'' Ford Aerospace President
Donald B. Rassier said.
   ``It is hard to imagine a better fit of talents, technologies
and businesses, ... than Ford Aerospace and BDM,'' he said.
   BDM has 3,700 employees at 14 technology centers and 36 other
offices in the United States and foreign countries. It earned $5.3
million, or 44 cents a share, on revenue of $73 million in the
first quarter of 1988.
   In 1987, BDM earned $19.7 million, or $1.66 a share, on revenue
of $314 million. Benson said BDM has reported 18 consecutive years
of increased earnings.
   ``We have been assured a good measure of autonomy and clearly,
the combination is an exciting one in terms of future growth and
development,'' said Earle C. Williams, BDM president and chief
executive officer.
   In 1987, BDM was awarded government contracts worth about $400
million, while Ford Aerospace garnered government contracts worth
$1.3 billion, Ford spokesman Eugene Koch said.
   Ford does not release separate earnings data for its
subsidiaries.
   BDM provides professional and technical services in national
defense and security, communications, systems integration, energy,
logistics, space, information systems, manufacturing technology and
other areas.
   Ford Aerospace is involved in command, control, communications
and intelligence systems, tactical weapons systems, space systems
including communications and sensing satellites, and engineering
services.
   It has headquarters in California and Washington, D.C., and
major operations in California, Colorado, Maryland, Texas and
Virginia.

the second time in three years Tuesday, and the House swiftly
countered by voting to enact the measure over his objections.
   ``I am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our
economic growth,'' Reagan said in focusing his veto message on a
provision that would require companies to give their employees
notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   Within hours, the House voted, 308-113, to override the veto.
The margin was well above the two-thirds majority required, but it
was thought unlikely that the Senate would go along when it
considers the override after next week's Memorial Day recess.
   Sixty House Republicans defected from the administration and
voted to override. Only one Democrat, Robert Mrazek of New York, a
strong advocate of free trade, voted to sustain the president.
   Lawmakers said Reagan's action represented the launching of a
major campaign issue.
   ``I happen to think it's a better issue for the Democrats than
for the Republicans,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
asked, ``Why hand it to us on a silver platter.''
   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis wasted no
time seizing it. He called the veto ``unconscionable.''
   Dukakis said Reagan and Vice President George Bush ``don't
understand that for working families who struggle to pay the
mortgage, save for their children's education and care for their
elders, there is nothing more painful than losing a job.''
   ``Any administration that is willing to give General (Manuel)
Noriega 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to
give the American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out
on the street,'' Dukakis said. He referred to a tentative deal to
drop drug charges against the Panamanian strongman if he agrees to
relinquish power and leave Panama by August.
   The House approved the measure, 312-107, on April 21.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., acknowledged that
the Senate would not override the president when it considers the
veto early next month, but he scoffed at Reagan's request for
speedy consideration of a stripped-down version of the bill.
   A presidential veto can only be overidden if both chambers vote
to do it by two-thirds margins.
   In particular, Reagan objected to the plant-closing requirement,
as well as provisions restricting the export of Alaskan oil. White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president would sign a
new bill that deleted both sections.
   But Byrd warned that it will be ``extremely difficult'' for a
new bill to wend its way through the chamber's complex procedures
before its Oct. 8 adjournment. ``Anybody who thinks that can be
done in the Senate is simply naive,'' he said.
   Wright, speaking with reporters before Reagan acted, said that
if Democrats can't override Reagan's veto, they would push ``the
strongest, most effective trade bill that you can, but that will
take time.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas predicted, however,
that not only will the veto be sustained in the Senate, but a
cleaner version will become law.
   ``There's enough time. If the House sends us a trade bill and
says `Take it or leave it,' I think we'll take it,'' he said.
   Reagan pledged to work for a new bill, saying, ``I am committed
to enactment of a responsible trade bill this year.''
   In his conciliatory message to Congress, he said he acted ``with
sincere regret'' and lauded the members for doing a ``remarkable
job'' during the three years the bill has been under consideration.
   ``Unfortunately, as the process came to a close, provisions were
included that simply make this bill, on balance, bad for America,''
Reagan said.
   Apparently bowing to the popularity of the plant-closing
provision and attempting to blunt use of the issue in the coming
elections, the president said he backed voluntary notification of
layoffs and closings.
   ``It allows the workers, the employer, the community, time to
adjust to the dislocation. It is the humane thing to do,'' he said.
   Reagan argued that companies need flexibility in announcing
layoffs or closings in order to survive times of economic stress
and that he opposed the mandatory provision in the bill. He said
exemptions in the legislation were ``too ambiguous to be workable.''
   The president contended the bill would injure an economy that
has created 16 million new jobs and has the lowest employment rate
in 14 years.
   He also argued that the bill would push the nation in the
direction of protectionism. ``Closing our borders is not the
solution to opening foreign markets.'' he said.
   Byrd accused the administration of using the plant-closing
provision as ``a smokescreen'' for its opposition to any trade
legislation, contending it had six years of Senate leadership to
put one through, and it never did.
   A 63-36 Senate vote approving the compromise legislation last
month was short of the two-thirds margin needed to override a veto,
suggesting the veto is likely to be sustained in that chamber.
   In 1986, Congress upheld Reagan's veto of another major trade
bill, one that would have slapped stiff quotas on textile imports.
   On Monday, Reagan cited recent trade statistics showing a $4
billion improvement in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit between
February and March as reflecting ``a genuine boom in exports.''
   Administration officials have cited recent improvements in the
trade deficit, particularly on the export side of the ledger, as a
reason for not enacting restrictive trade measures.
   The trade bill is a compromise between separate versions that
passed both chambers last year _ a strongly worded House measure
that called for mandatory retaliation against foreign countries and
a milder Senate version.
   In addition to the provisions on plant closings and Alaska oil,
the administration opposes provisions to increase some farm
subsidies, expand a program for aiding dislocated workers and
requiring an unfair-trading investigation of Japan for failing to
open its public works projects to U.S. construction companies.
   The White House also opposes sections that call for some
mandatory retaliation against trading partners and which limit the
president's flexibility to act in granting trade relief to U.S.
industries.
   However, the administration likes some features of the bill,
including provisions renewing its authority to participate in
global trade negotiations.
